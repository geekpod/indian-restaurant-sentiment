1,"I was extremely dissatisfied with my recent experience at the Domino's outlet in Belapur. I had placed an order through the app, but when I received it, the pizza was not up to my expectations. The quality of food was subpar, and I was particularly disappointed when I found out that they had skipped serving bread in the so-called 'pizza' I ordered. I strongly feel that they need to re-evaluate their staff and the chef to provide better-quality food and service to their customers.
Bealpur Sector-11"
1,"I ordered meal for two today at this outlet, they told me counter order closed at 1900 hrs and need to order online for home delivery, assured me that order will served at the table. All this happened the staff told me they will ge Rs30/- from company. While I was waiting for my order, some other delivery boy took the order to deliver it some unknown place.
I confronted them and they were clueless. Total unprofessional behaviour. I also asked them to clean the table but for good 15 minutes no one attended again I had to remind them.
Never ever visit that store again."
3,"Firstly they said that online payment was not working and asked us to pay in cash. We didn't have cash so they agreed to take online payment and it worked. We ordered the food and they didn't give us the order number. They said the food will come to your place. The food didn't arrive for 20 minutes, we went to check in and the whole staff was confused about where the order was. They then gave us already packed food which was just lying there since 10 minutes. No responsibility taken, no efforts taken. They didn't even give us Chilli flakes or Oregano. Only good thing was they gave us mobile charger."
4,"The store was good, furniture was well maintained and cleanliness was up to the mark. In fact the store guy helped me with charging my phone. The pizza was super yum and hot. The store is at a walkable distance to the Railway Station,   Overall a satisfactory response"
1,"Never in my life have I been to a store where the staff have been this rude and standoffish. I went to place my order for takeaway and the staff taking my order seemed so disappointed to see me as if I had ruined his day just by walking into the store, then a lady came up and instead of the usual ""hi what would you like to order?"" She just raised her eyebrow at me, gesturing at me in a questioning way. I wanted garlic breadstick and a bottle of Pepsi, so they entered my phone number and asked for my OTP which I provided and the lady tells me, we only have coke, Pepsi is only for online orders, so I decided to place my order online and walked out. When I tried to place the order online, the store was offline and not accepting orders. The ownere should get rid of these staff they seem so reluctant to do their damn job"
2,"There is no taste in the food.
Never ever try noodles, u will regret forever.
It‚Äôs like dhaba where authenticity of dhaba is missing completely.
No wonder why it always empty.
Don‚Äôt waste ur time and money."
3,"It is a very good and very reasonable Hotel in sector 10 Belapur. All corporate office people visit there for afternoon lunch. Very tasty food both in Veg and non-veg. I have tried Paneer tikka masala , Pannel kebab starters very nice quantity was good. Non veg starters in both Chinese and indian are nice along with main course.

Pros - Very reasonable and pocket friendly with overall good ambience."
5,The food is really delicious. Loved the place and ambience.
5,Very good place to celebrate occasions like Birthdays.
5,I have ordered veg biryani. Taste was delicious.. Couldn't explain in words.. Just try it without thinking. Best service and pleasant ambiance. Would like to try more dishes there.
1,Counter person is arrogant.  Food quality was not up to the mark...  Owner should have a look...
5,"Cool hang out if u like to chat up with friends over drinks. Food is tasty. Ambience is rustic , it helps , if u are not bothered about it."
5,Food is very tasty and delicious specially Dal khichdi with butter. go for chinese here. The prices are no cost friendly. They offer on 10 % on kitchen order in happy hour .
5,"Nice place to sit for a few drinks. Food here is slightly above average along with quick service from the staff.
Pocket friendly prices."
3,"This is Bar and Restaurant in CBD belapur.  Good service and food is also good,  evening many people visit this hotel for drinks and food,  parking on Street. Reasonable rates near vivekanand nagar bus stop in c b d belapur. There is Axis Bank üèß besides this restaurant. Good for friendsüë≠üë¨üë´ only no family."
3,"Good place small place to enjoy a few drinks with a group of friends. Plus for sports fans. Plus for women as well. I saw women coming here and comfortably getting a drink too. When we were there, the staff was overwhelmed serving 6 tables but that's alright.

Chicken lollipop hit the spot for me :)"
5,"Good service with ambience.
Staff is very polite and prompt.
Try veg spring rolls and chicken chilly and chicken fried rice.
Good discounts on drinks at happy hours."
5,Its a small lounge with plenty of drinks option. They allow smoking inside the lounge which is big down side. Not suitable for family. They offer 20 percentage discount between 11 am to 6 pm on total bill.
5,This is my go to place to hang out and drink beer with my friends. The food is also super good and clean. And the price is really reasonable. The cherry on the top is the 24x7 1+1 draught beer offers this place has.
4,"Went to meet my school. Friends and was searching for a good place where we can. Have some time together.

Choose J9 sports bar just on the base of review...

To be candid... The place is bit Cramped.. With full house it will become claustrophobic.

Food was ok ok... Ordered hara bhara kabab.. It was bit oily..

Spent around 2000 for just 3 beers, 2 lime soda and harabhara kabab with masala papad.

Overall nice. Place for having a quick meeting and 1 time go."
5,"I don't really know about Manohar Mishthan, but these cuties definitely make the place worth going back to again and again. Also if you're reading this review, MAKE SURE YOU FEED THEM!!"
1,"I recently ordered samosas from this place, and it was a thoroughly disappointing experience. The samosas were overly spicy, and worse, some of us suffered from stomachaches while others had diarrhea. Both the samosas and the chutney had an unpleasant smell, and the overall quality was extremely poor.  This shop used to be a favorite during my childhood‚Äîwe often bought snacks here as we‚Äôre from Belapur. Sadly, the quality and taste have deteriorated significantly over the years. I cannot recommend this place anymore."
3,Fresh sweets. Store representatives are very polite in their approach. Smooth payments. Snacks counter is good.
5,Very tasty and quality food is served here.  All the sweets and snacks items are available.  Arrangement of items are very neat and clean so that its visible.  Rates are competitive. Shop is spacious and have variety of options.
5,"Manohar Mishthan is the place to satisfy your sweet tooth! Their sweets are absolutely amazing, and you won't be able to resist their delectable treats. From traditional Indian sweets to mouthwatering desserts, they have it all. Don't miss out on this sweet paradise! üç≠üç∞üç®"
5,"If you‚Äôre looking for a spot that serves a blend of global flavours with an ambient poolside setting, Pool Side Restaurant delivers on both taste and vibe.
Enjoyed refreshing cocktails

1. Arabian Platter:
A true showstopper! This platter was a generous spread of falafels, hummus, pita, grilled kebabs, and pickled veggies. Each bite was packed with Middle Eastern flavor, and the creamy hummus paired perfectly with the warm, fluffy pita.

2. Exotic Chipotle Veg Pizza:
Crisp thin crust, loaded with vibrant veggies and a smoky chipotle base that added a bold kick. It‚Äôs a great choice for spice lovers who want something different from the usual margherita.

3. Honey Chilli Lotus Stem:
Crunchy, sticky, and slightly spicy ‚Äì this dish nailed the texture and balance of sweet and heat. It makes for a fantastic appetizer, especially if you‚Äôre sipping cocktails by the pool.

4. Drunken Fish and Chips:
A fun twist on the classic British dish! The beer-battered fish was crisp on the outside and juicy inside, served with perfectly golden fries and a tangy tartar sauce. Comfort food with flair.

5. Poulet Supreme Sizzler:
Served sizzling hot, the chicken was tender and flavorful with a rich sauce that paired well with grilled veggies.It‚Äôs hearty, satisfying, and makes a dramatic entrance to the table!

Ambience:
The poolside setting adds a relaxed yet elegant touch ‚Äì great for brunches, date nights, or laid-back evening dinners.

Verdict:
Creative menu, great plating, and a refreshing ambience. Highly recommended if you‚Äôre in the mood for diverse flavors in a chic, open-air space."
4,"We went for a casual dinner on a Saturday night as the place seemed pleasant and had open air dining by the pool. There were other families and music playing. The continental food was good like the pasta and pizzas, the sizzlers were good but quantity was pretty less. Overall a good experience."
3,"The place and ambience is superb.

The food was however ,a super letdown.

Banjara kebab which we ordered was ko
too spicy.Chicken cafreal sizzler was too  bland and dry.We even tried informing the chef about the sizzler,but he was adamant that this is how the sizzler tastes."
3,"We ordered a mix of Indian and Lebanese cuisine. The Chicken Banjara Tikka and Prawn Chilli were well-prepared and flavorful, while the Arabian platter fell short in terms of taste. However, the overall ambiance of the restaurant was pleasant and added to the dining experience."
1,"Food quality and cooking temp was not upto mark we were served hard chewy undercooked prawns which were frozen prawns and they didn't thaw or defrost them properly before cooking. Over all their kitchen is bugged with this issue for all cuisines even paneer tikka was not soft and felt undercooked. The most tasty dish they served us was ""Onion Plate and butter naan"" üòá Their veg starters tasted good but service was not good even when place was half empty on sunday. They have dj music on sundays so its not quiet or pleasant by any means."

4,"If you want a great ambiance and want a buffet this might be the place for you. The buffet is a little on the expensive side costing 1600/- pp. The starters were a little bit bland as per me, not much spices or flavour is involved. The best part of the buffet is the desert, mouth watering and tasty cakes and other sweets. You can enjoy with your friends and family with indoor and outdoor seating as well."
5,"Great place with a cozy vibe ü•∞
Amazing place to have buffet with your loved ones üòç
They have South Indian, North Indian, English breakfast, fruits, fruit juices, salads, tea coffee, and desserts üòã
The food was great but not awesome. The sambar and chutney could be a little better.
The masala omelette with mushrooms and bell peppers were really good üòã
And ya they have a outdoor seating area which is so classy üòé
I highly recommend visiting this place if you are in Navi Mumbai ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
5,"The restaurant has a good mix of South Indian and continental options in the breakfast buffet. The pasteries, cupcakes, salads, main course and desserts are very delightful. A lovely ambience especially by the poolside. We stayed at the hotel too and has a very good time."
4,"Good food. Ambience is good for families.
The buffet spread is adequate although they can have more Dessert options. The service was quite good. Tends to get noisy if there's any wedding/functions happening within the hotel premises.  Was informed that there is no in-house bakery hence we cannot have cakes ordered for any celebrations but are allowed to bring from outside."
3,"We have tried pasta, biriyani and pizza.
Pasta was good.
Biriyani is average.
Chipotle pizza was not good, we end up leaving.

Food taste is average compare to price.
Buffet is available with good options."
4,"Wow bhaji is just a min away from Belapur station,

The place from outside it self looks pretty¬†pleasant¬†& gentle. Well maintained ambiance & has a¬†cassette¬†ac which cools the place all over instead of splits¬†chilling a certain area.

Wow bhaji is managed by a hearty old lady who is happy to serve her valuable customers.

Tried their Wow Bhaji and trust me I never had tasted such tempting¬†Pav bhaji in my whole¬†life. The pav bhaji is of black colour as they don't add any artificial colour, the pav were juicy full of loaded butter in it. All the¬†big heads of Pav bhaji in South should learn from them how¬†to make pav bhaji alike them.

Double wow pav :- Personally I didn't like it at all. The server suggested me to go for it as it was their specialty. the dish definitely needs some work, there was huge amount of Garam masala in it. I Could hardly taste the pav. But yes the pav bhaji just nailed it."
4,Decent Ambience with unbeatable Cheese Chilly Toast served is its unique. Also one of favourite i am frequent visitor of this place. Sandwitches too are good to try. Though its famous for its Unique Pav Bhaji but i would prefer Cheese Chilly Toast over it. I atleast visit once in a week. Service is prompt and polite.
5,"Interesting and Tasty Food Menu!!
Something unique!! Not regularly Fast-Food!!
Do try:
White Rose Milk Shake
Masala Pav (Different Recipe)
And ofcourse Wow Bhaji!!"
4,"Simply goes by the name.... WoW Pav WoW Bhaji
Must visit for a quick lunch/dinner"
4,"Delicious pavbhaji with no added color.. Wow pav (masala pav) is good too.. Prompt service, hygiene is an add on."
3,"The place is good and seen it 3 times renovating itself. The place is purely vegetarian with thali and a la carte options available. The food is at tastier side and cheaper on pockets. The place is easily visible being on the main road. Even in such a small setup, they maintain professionalism and did accepted Sodexo coupons up till my last visit there. On and all, a better place if you don't like sitting outside in the khau galli and want some privacy sort of thing with neat setup."
5,A good and affordable vegetarian place to eat. Different varieties of parathas are available. Max 100 per person. Tasty food and cleanliness are the main highlights..
5,Very good food at low price. Quality is like three/five star hotel
4,"Good, neat and clean place to have food. Vada misal pav, Parathas and chole bature are good there"
3,"The best place in Fisherman Kitchen
The best dice is daal thadka and butter chapati and veg dum biryani Pelees kam in the hotel and try"
5,"Visited this place for dinner. Ordered Tawa fry surmai thali with rice bakri (tandalachi bakri), sol kadhi and Prawns koilwada.

The portion size for prawns koilwada was a feast. The prawns had a very crispy layer from the outside and soft within and rich in flavour. The thali was amazing in taste. The bakri was very soft and complemented the surmai very well. Sol kadhi was refreshing.

Restaurant had a good ambience and service was also good. Overall experience was very goodüëç."
1,"We were a group of four who visited Krishna Hotel for a meal. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a terrible experience. After eating there, all of us ended up with upset stomachs. The food quality was clearly not up to the mark, and hygiene seemed very questionable.
I strongly advise others to avoid this place if you care about your health. Totally disappointed!"
5,"I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a great option for those looking for good food on a budget. The taste was quite nice, and the pricing makes it even more appealing. However, the ambiance wasn‚Äôt the best‚Äînothing too fancy, but decent enough for a casual meal. If you‚Äôre someone who prioritizes food quality over decor, this place is worth considering!"
5,"Excellent Food and service. I was looking restaurant to have Lunch and unknowingly visited this place. I was really amazed by the food I had ordered Chicken Tandoori lollipop and Chicken Tandoori Masala with Butter Naan. The taste was really amazing chicken was cooked well. Tender and juicy.

Recommended dish: Chicken Tandoori Lollipop"
1,HI Everyone I have ordered paneer kofta from Krishna lunch home but I didn't saw any paneer in that veg only masala given and also ordered tandoori roti but that also not properly made so I request you to all don't order any food from Krishna lunch home and also don't visit making fool to customer's
1,Not available
5,never
4,"A small calm cafe and co-working space in walkable distance from Belapur railway station and metro station. Great Ambience and amazing food. Warm service too. Tried flavoured latte and chicken bonanza pizza. Latte was usual but pizza was worth every penny.
Being a co-working space, the chairs weren't very comfortable for sitting down for a long time.
Free wifi and outdoor seating is available. Smoking allowed at outdoor seating."
5,"Chocolate Frappe : That was from another World, Teste was very different

Mango Mint Shake: Sweet mango with a hint of mint ‚Äì a tropical and refreshing twist!

Veggie Lover Pizza: Fresh veggies on a perfectly baked crust with creamy cheese. A burst of flavors in every bite!

Friendly Staff: Super welcoming and attentive, making your visit even better!"
5,The Ambience is Really great.The Staff is very friendly and specially the beverages are amazing.Loved it totally
5,"Chaai Centre & Co - Working Space is the always one of my go to Place for having Classic Coffee and some Fabulous Continental Food. Ample of Variety on Beverage Menu and a Gigantic Food Menu makes this the Best hangout Cafe in the Vicinity. The Ambience itself makes every Patron comfortable and enjoy their quality time. This place is beautifully designed and managed by the team lead by Mr. Irfan, who has been running the show for over 8+ years. Being regular at this place for quite a long time, the service received here is enjoyable and comfortable. Definitely a must visit with your family and Colleagues and spend time at this Luxurious and Friendly Cafe"
5,"Chai Centre is a great place! As soon as you step inside, you are greeted with a warm and inviting ambiance. The comfortable seating area and attractive d√©cor create the perfect setting for a relaxing and enjoyable dining experience.

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the food! The milkshakes at Chai Centre Caf√© are simply heavenly. They are thick, creamy, and full of flavor.

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the mango crepes and pancakes. These sweet delicacies are really delicious. The crepes are thin and delicate, filled with fresh mango pieces and topped with a few drops of honey. Speaking of the pancakes, they are fluffy and light, served with whipped cream and maple syrup. These dishes are perfect to satisfy your sweet cravings.

And don‚Äôt forget the cold chocolate latte! It is a refreshing and delicious drink that combines the richness of chocolate with the smoothness of a latte. It is the perfect pick-me-up on a hot summer day or whenever you need a delicious drink.

Overall, Chai Centre Caf√© is a foodie‚Äôs paradise. The menu offers a wide variety of options, ensuring that there is something to satisfy every desire.

5,"One of the best bar in Belapur
Complimentary always changes every day with new new dishes"
4,"Good food great taste and quantiy

Veg Kanali recommended.
Over all good experince
***Beware to cross check bill before making payment**"
4,"Good service, food items reasonable price"
5,We visited this place last night. We enjoyed food with Live Match. Seafood was awesome.
1,"Worst food, i order apple chicken fully bad taste and lollipop is full of cornstarch only, waste of money totally"
1,"We had a disappointing experience at CCD. When placing our order, we were told that all coffees would be ‚Äústrong‚Äù (compulsory), which we accepted. However, after making the payment, we were not given a bill.

When we tried to check the excess amount charged beyond the listed coffee rates and taxes, the staff delayed providing the bill. Even after finishing our coffees (around 40‚Äì45 minutes later), we had to wait another 5+ minutes just to get the bill‚Äîmeaning it wasn‚Äôt even generated for nearly 50 minutes.

Upon reviewing the bill, we discovered they had charged extra for double-shot espresso in each coffee, despite initially telling us that it was already included (compulsory).

This kind of misleading billing and poor service left a very bad impression. Definitely not visiting this caf√© again.

Point to add we mailed Customer care and received the call from the cafe same counter person was on the call and she was confronting me. This is what they provide as solution. She wasted my time again."
5,"A decent place to do some work meanwhile enjoying your coffee with some snacks
They offer free wifi, clean washroom
The service is good ,the staff is very humble"
5,"This CCD outlet has really nice chill vibes. Went on a Friday evening-  had decent crowd. The seating options are both indoor and outdoor with indoor having a group table with small tables too.
Great place to work in solitude, meeting or catch-up with friends.
They have a power Bank outlet station.
Coming to the food, I personally liked it.
üî∏ Iced mocha: 5/5 - light with a decent caffeine kick
üî∏Hot velvet coffee: 5+/5 - rich decadent
üî∏Cheese tomato croissant : 4/5, the croissant was flaky itself, just wish it didn't have the mayo part and maybe a pinch of blackpepper but otherwise I liked it.
üî∏ Chocolate Croissant: 5+/5 simply delicious
üî∏Chilli cheese toast : 3/5, the topping was good but the quantity and quality of the bread could have been better. (Given the fact their Croissants are great)
üî∏Big Chicken Burger : 2.5/5. Not so great. Came with a side of chips(which were nice) & dip. Wouldn't recommend the burger.
The staff is polite with promt service.
Well maintained hygiene.
Overall loved this visit at the CCD Belapur outlet. We came with well fed tummies & a decent caffeine kick to enter the weekend !!
Looking forward to try more stuff on their menu."
1,They have sort of different menu they force you to order speciality coffee and hide the normal menu .a cappuchino in the speciality menu comes by default with double shot espresso which is toomuch caffeine for some .last week they did have the normal menu card which had the smaller cappuccino with single shot espresso but this week they have stopped showing that menue and only speciality menu is present which has minimum 350ml mugs that's too much coffee .I think they want to increase spending from per person instead should have focused on brand policies.
3,"The place is perfect, campus is good.
One thing I notice that they dont have charging points only on the walls. They have big table in the middle which dont have any charging plugs.
Overall I see the CCD has charging mostly for the time which you spend in the shop. The quality and taste of coffee could be better."
5,"Absolutely Marvelous! Very neat, clean & tidy. They were very understanding and served Mango milk shake for my 7 year old son without any ice. He thoroughly enjoyed it. I had a delicious cold coffee and it gave me the much needed wake up call at noon."
5,"A must try place for all veg lovers in navi mumbai located near the seawoods stationüòçMust try:-
1)Babycorn chili-the taste is superb a must try starter.If you enjoy great food definately order this you won't regretüíØ
2)Veg Rajdhani for maincourse with garlic naan which was best in class taste.Loved the ambience and overall a good place for family timeüòç.Explore this place and do visit for sure."
3,"Misal pav was okay, it wasnt spicy or had any unique flavours. Might go back to try other things from there"
3,"Overall ok to good - 3.5 star
Nice ambience.
The dress code is not followed by all staffs, which became little difficult for us.
We ordered :-
Special Prithika Biryani - it was good nothing special ‚Äî 4 stars
Veg Rajdhani - it was Ok curry ‚Äî3 stars Butter Kulcha ‚Äî it was served quite well with curd and tasted good - 4.5 star
Butter Garlic Naan - it was again good - 4.5"
5,"I had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant for the first time today, and it was an unforgettable experience! The dosa was absolutely delicious ‚Äì perfectly crisp with just the right amount of filling. The sambar and chutneys were authentic and full of flavor, reminding me of home-cooked meals. The staff was incredibly warm and welcoming, making the entire experience even better. This is undoubtedly one of the best vegetarian restaurants I've been to, and I can't wait to visit again. Highly recommend it to everyone."
4,"We had an exceptional dining experience at Barbeque Nation CBD Belapur. The food was not only delectable but also prepared and served with utmost hygiene. The vast array of culinary options was truly impressive, catering to diverse palates.

The service staff were extremely courteous, attentive, and supportive, ensuring that our every need was met. We were delighted to share this experience with our foreign guests, who were equally impressed by the flavors and hospitality.

Kudos to Barbeque Nation CBD Belapur for creating a memorable evening! We look forward to visiting again soon.""

I made some changes to enhance clarity, vocabulary, and overall flow. Feel free to modify it further to suit your tone and style!"
1,"Staff not entertain properly we're 17 people over there we paid to them more than 20 thousand, and we get service not much , food was uncooked and after the complaining staff was not entertain us , we have to ask for one order for multiple times then they served. not happy with the service. Our weekend goes worst."
3,The quality of Starters was pathetic except few. Main course is better than Starters.  They deliberately bring Starters which cost less. The Desserts are pathetic
5,The staffs were so polite and well mannered.. The food tasted delicious and the ambience was so nice.. Little more items are required in the dessert section especially icecreams.. Overall i had a good experience!!
5,"Recently visited Barbeque Nation Belapur. The atmosphere, ambience, food and service everything was excellent. One thing I would suggest is to increase the food options in main course. Rest everything was good. The grilled fish was amazing and the mushroom as well. Loved it."
1,The red velvet pastry was too hard it was not like how a pastry should be soft and not even it had a good taste they have kept expire product i guess because of that your pastry was tasteless and hard. My whole mood got spoiled because of it i was too excited to eat pastry after long time and this is what i got worst ever not gonna buy anything from monginis rather i would go to cake world beside it. Not worth it to 80 rs.
4,"A lot of varieties of yummy cakes to be chosen from. Many of their displayed cakes are heart shaped which is a disadvantage. Can pre order cake as our requirement. The cakes are yummy and worth the money.They serve snacks also to walk in customers , however there is no seats to sit and that it. People can stand inside and have a quick bite."
1,"Today we bought the 01 kg cake for birthday celebration from the monginis cake shop in CBD Belapur, it is a completely tasteless and stale cake, so I recommend everyone not buy cakes for any celebration from Monginis shop.  Very bad experience"
5,"I recently had the pleasure of visiting the Monginis cake shop and I must say, it was an exceptional experience! The moment I walked in, I was greeted with a warm smile by the staff and the aroma of freshly baked cakes. The shop was clean and well-maintained, which is a big plus in my book.

I ordered a custom  Dutch-Chocolate cake for a special occasion and the team at Monginis went above and beyond to ensure that it was perfect. The cake was not only delicious but also beautifully designed. The attention to detail and the quality of the ingredients used were evident in every bite.

What impressed me the most was the excellent customer service. The staff were friendly, helpful, and patient, answering all my questions and accommodating my requests. They truly cared about making sure I was satisfied with my purchase.

I would highly recommend Monginis cake shop to anyone looking for a great cake and an even better experience. They truly deserve 5 stars."
4,Loved over taste good variety and decent price!
4,"Very nice services. I had organized a banquet party for almost 600 people in my son's marriage, his catering service is fantastic.Foods and sweets were very tasty and especially paneer angara and kaju katri  was wow! Kameshwar Maharaj ji behaves much better.
They gives great services at very reasonable price.
Yeah overall experience was nice.
I would recommend you go for itüëç."

5,this hotel is very beautiful palace

4,"Not many varieties than compared to other outlets but the taste overall is superb. Not to forget the Cream Chomchom and Baked Rasogulla which contains palm jaggery. For all the sweet lovers, this place is heavenüòá Bengali sweets at its best!!üòçü§§"
4,"Sweet Bengal is famous for the taste and quality of their sweets. I have tried Kheer Kodom, Black currant Kalakand, Rasgulla, Chitrakut, Rosokodom from this place and they tasted awesome!!!"
3,"They serve authentic Bengal Sweets and snacks. Although they keep fresh items but bit overpriced. e.g Rasagolla 1 pc = 24, Malai Roll 1pc=Rs40 etc."
4,"If you looking for good quality sweets, especially bengali sweets, then this is your place. The taste is really awesome but the prices are a bit high. Hoping they'll do something about it."
4,The sweets are good. Must try items are ice cream Sandesh and jol bhora.
4,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at this charming establishment, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations in every way. From the moment I stepped inside, I was enveloped in a warm and cozy atmosphere that immediately put me at ease.

The food was exceptional, with a diverse menu that catered to a range of tastes and dietary preferences. Each dish was expertly prepared, presented, and bursting with flavor. I was thoroughly impressed by the quality and care that went into each culinary creation.

But what truly sets this place apart is the outstanding service. The staff were attentive, friendly, and remarkably efficient, ensuring that our meal was served promptly and with a smile. The service was genuinely faultless, and I appreciated the extra touches that made our dining experience feel special.

Overall, I highly recommend this lovely establishment for a relaxing lunch or any occasion. Its winning combination of delicious food, impeccable service, and cozy ambiance makes it an ideal spot to unwind and enjoy a great meal.

Highlights:

- Cozy and inviting atmosphere
- Excellent food quality and presentation
- Faultless and friendly service
- Ideal for a relaxing lunch or casual dining experience"
4,"One of the best Sea food restaurants in Belapur. Very popular. They have multiple sections - family, AC, non AC, smoking, non smoking etc. The service was quick. Ordered Surmai Masala Fry, Neer Dosa and solkadi. All tasted really good. Price was slightly on the higher side. The owner Mr. Mahesh is seen sitting here monitoring operations. A must visit place, would surely recommend."
4,"Review on hosting an event with Mahesh Lunch Home and Bar banquet halls

I had the pleasure of hosting my Roce ceremony at  the banquet hall of Mahesh Lunch Home and bar, and it was an unforgettable experience. Their all-inclusive service provided seamless execution, from decorations to DJ, tailored to our specific needs. The food buffet was exceptional, featuring authentic Mangalorean cuisine that delighted our guests. The booking process was effortless, and the entire team, led by Ramesh Shetty and Manager Raj, went above and beyond to ensure a flawless event. I highly recommend Mahesh Lunch Home for any occasion and look forward to working with them again in the future."
5,"I have Organised my baby shower function here and it was very good experience.
Banquet Hall is having good capacity I have invited over 120 people and it was ease to manage them because hall provide separate dining area as well.
Hall having monopoly in decoration and food so you have no option other than choosing their services.
Quality of food is very nice. I would say that will be highlighting factor.
Decoration cost is higher side and I feel it was costly.
I will highly recommend this place if you want to arrange small function with capacity of around 100-120 people."
1,"The food quality was the worst, Behaviour of man who took order was not attentive, didn't explain much about dishes ."
4,"I visited the MacD in Belapur recently and had a mixed experience. The food was delicious and up to the usual MacD standards. However, there were a few issues that prevented me from having a completely satisfying experience.

The AC was not working, which made the dining area feel warm and uncomfortable. The restaurant was also a bit crowded, which added to the discomfort.

The washroom was not clean, which was a major letdown. I expect a clean and hygienic washroom from a reputable brand like MacD.

Additionally, the parking space was limited, which made it difficult for me to find a spot.

Finally, I was surprised that they didn't provide tissue paper in the restaurant. This seemed like a small but significant oversight.

Overall, while the food was good, the experience was marred by these issues. I hope MacD takes steps to address these problems and provides a better experience for its customers."
1,"Despite telling the attendent several times and even returning the burger once they still couldn't care enough to add a decent amount of sauce, the burger was dry as ever. Come on man your charging extra only for a mayo change with the new korians spicy chicken burger and you can't even add a decent amount of sauce, pothetic absolutely pothetic. Service has fallen below acceptable standards. Pothetic"
3,"While a typical McDonald‚Äôs and nothing to write specific to food quality, but the upkeep of the restaurant is very poor, tables are often not clean, flies around. Washrooms were dirty as well. Remains crowded and service is slower than usual than other outlets, they could hire more efficient staff and keep the place more hygienic."
5,"Clean and well-maintained outlet with plenty of seating. The staff is friendly and supportive, ensuring a smooth experience. Wait times are usually around 5‚Äì10 minutes, which is quite reasonable. Overall, a good spot for a quick meal."
4,"Its like all other MCD, its right opposite to decathlon,its an easy accessible spot to munch.
The location is great however parking is an issue."
5,"I recently visited Burger King in Belapur and was thoroughly impressed! The service was top-notch, with professional staff who were friendly and attentive.

The restaurant was extremely neat and clean, making for a pleasant dining experience. What really stood out was the birthday decorations they provided for our celebration - it was a lovely touch!

Unlike other fast-food joints, Burger King Belapur was surprisingly less crowded, which made our visit even more enjoyable.

If I had to choose between McDonald's and Burger King, I'd choose Burger King hands down! The quality of food, service, and ambiance here is unmatched.

Keep up the fantastic work, Burger King"
5,"Amazing amazing burger.... In love with wopper. I cant say how goor this burger is. Was initially a fan of macd's burgers but now i am fan of burger king. The shakes are super thick and creamy..and one of my favourite chicken bone-less wings was super yummy and crispy as well.. , to perfection...... thanks for your quality food and best service to me.."

The staff is also cooperative and guide you what is best."
4,"We recently ordered Burger King Grill Burger , Crispy Chicken Burger and Chicken Double Whopper.

The taste of burger was good and flavourful while the size could have been bit bigger.

The Chicken Double Whopper had two chicken patty with all veggies and mayonnaise. The size and taste was pretty good.

Would recommend Whopper if too hungry otherwise you can go for Burger .

5,"Yesterday night, we visited The Vintage Cafe. It is a quaint and charming cafe located in the heart of Belapur. The restaurant has cozy and relaxed atmosphere, with vintage decor and soft lighting creating a warm and inviting ambiance.

The food at The Vintage Cafe was simply delicious, with a variety of dishes to choose from, including both Indian and continental options. The portions are generous, and the presentation was also beautiful, making the dining experience all the more enjoyable.

The staff was friendly and attentive staff. They're knowledgeable about the menu and offer good recommendations based on your preferences.

The cafe is also quite affordable, considering the quality of the food and service. It's a great place to catch up with friends, have a business meeting, or simply relax and unwind on your own.

We tried chicken popcorn, chicken wings, falafal pockets with chicken and chicken crispy. Food was nice and perfectly cooked. Drinks were nice as well.

Overall, The Vintage Cafe is a must-visit for anyone looking for a great dining experience in Belapur. The combination of delicious food, excellent service, and cozy ambiance makes it a standout choice among other cafes in the area. Highly recommended!"
5,A unique place with vintage vibes. The place is a bit pricey but the price is worth for. The vibes are very classy and calm. Tried their asian and chinese cuisines in veg and nonveg. Tastes flavourful and yum. Definitely gonna visit again in future.
5,"Visited this place on 22nd September 2018
Easily accessible from a distance and takes approx 15 minutes walk from CBD Belapur.

They have covered almost all the main items for the cuisine across the globe!
If you plan to visit, try booking a table prior or you might have to wait a little as they open few tables in day time and 1st floor is for bar section!

Overall it's a nice place to be at!"

5,"The vintage caf√© is a multi - cuisine restaurant located in one of the prime locations in CBD-Belapur besides Sammy Sosa restaurant. It is one of the best party place where you get loud music and drinks on MRP. Yes, you read that right. DRINKS ON MRP.

5,"McDonald‚Äôs Nerul is my go-to spot whenever I crave a good cup of coffee and some crispy chicken nuggets. Their coffee is always fresh and rich in flavor‚Äîperfect for a quick pick-me-up. And the chicken nuggets? Absolutely delicious! Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and always served hot.

The service is quick, the staff is friendly, and the place is clean and comfortable. Whether I‚Äôm grabbing a quick snack or just stopping by for coffee, it‚Äôs always a great experience. Highly recommend for coffee and nugget lovers!"
3,"Not a great experience for a mcdonalds, burger buns dont taste fresh they dont hold well together and crumble in the hands. Service was very slow for Mcdonalds. Ordering system is ok restaurant was generally clean and tidy with plenty of seating."
1,"So i planned my kid's birthday party in McDonald's, and oh my, do I regret!!!
Due to some technical issues with the electricity board, there was an electricity blackout for almost 30 minutes. To my surprise, McDonald's here has no battery backup or a simple generator, so we waited in a blacked out room with 25 people with our mobile torches on!
After a while, the issue was resolved as the electricity came back. Then the floor manager says there is no food as the kitchen is not functioning because of the low electricity supply! After that i lost my cool and ""requested"" the McDonald's person to go to some other branch of McDonald's and get burgers fries and beverages by any means and serve our guest. Till that moment they were just waiting for i dont know what! The assistant appointed for our help was always to be called and searched for she was never on place. And a genuine queation is - if the place is booked 10 days ago! A reminder call is made 1 day prior by me to McDonald's about our booking and even after reaching McDonald's 30 minutes before the party time how was the food not available???? Why does a big franchise such as McDonald's doesn't have such basic facility of a power backup?"
5,"Visited here after a long tiring day. This outlet is really massive, clean and extremely well maintained ‚ú®.
Visited here for some deserts. Came here along with a friend and brought Chocolate Overload McFlurry and Oreo softy.
Staff behaviour was extremely good. Service took a bit of time due to rush hours but it's fine. Overall an awesome experience. Visit with your friends, cousin or anyone on normal or plan a birthday celebration here"
5,"McDonald‚Äôs in Nerul offers a convenient spot for a quick and satisfying meal. The restaurant is clean and well-maintained, with a spacious seating area that‚Äôs great for families, friends, or even solo diners. The menu has all the classic McDonald‚Äôs offerings, from their iconic burgers and fries to new seasonal items. Service is usually prompt, and the staff is courteous, though it can get a bit crowded during peak hours, leading to longer waits. The outlet is consistent with McDonald‚Äôs standards, ensuring quality food, but don‚Äôt expect any surprises if you‚Äôre a regular.
vo"
3,"It‚Äôs a small nice cafe with decent ambience yet offers a lot with books, games, karaoke and open mic nights. Service and staff is courteous and well behaved. We liked the food and overall preparation, lasagna was well made and is a must order. Coffee is about ok, portion size is too small and could be a bit improved. We tried the tiramisu, which was a complete no-no, overly sweet, too chocolaty ( coffee flavor was completely missing) and was not at all fresh, assuming deserts can be fully skipped."
5,"My first time here but man oh man what a lovely place to be in‚Ä¶ the Food we had was amazing Richard (The Manager) was so sure about the food he said ‚ÄúWilbur try anything.. everything on our menu is amazing‚Äù and damm right he was .. the place is so beautiful the Atmosphere is so positive and full of love ‚Ä¶ had an amazing evening here‚Ä¶ must visit if you are in and around from here‚Ä¶ these guys know their food and their work really well‚Ä¶ also the karaoke nights are super fun
Apart from this you can also read books and play games they have all the things you need to make your valuable time really special

Pros: Ambience
Food
People
Staff
Experience

Cons
I felt so homely after a point didnt wana leave

Def coming here again and recommend it to all"
4,"Sailors Cafe is a cozy, pet-friendly gem that‚Äôs perfect for a relaxed outing. What sets it apart is the adorable pet menu,such a thoughtful touch for furry companions!

We tried the Omu Rice, which was a solid 5/5 with its comforting flavor and perfect texture. The Aloo Paratha gets a 4/5(not quite my taste, but still well-made).

The space is filled with shelves of books and a great collection of board games, making it a fun hangout spot. The staff is warm and welcoming, adding to the great vibe. And the best surprise? A nostalgia-filled chocolate box at the counter with Melody and Kismi candies, it instantly made our day.

Highly recommend if you're looking for a chill, pet-friendly caf√© with great food and wholesome vibes."
5,"I‚Äôve been to this place four times already, and I just can‚Äôt wait to visit again! It‚Äôs truly one of my favorite caf√©s in Navi Mumbai‚Äîbeautifully run by amazing hosts who always make you feel at home. Their divine tiramisu cake is an absolute must-try, and I love bringing all my favorite people here to share the experience.

One of the highlights for me is their unique Sailor‚Äôs Special Coffee‚Äîa real treat for coffee lovers. The cozy book corner, indoor games, and the warm, welcoming vibe make it the perfect spot to relax or have fun. There are often interesting activities and events happening too, which adds to the charm.

With a friendly owner, comforting ambience, and thoughtful little touches all around, this is a truly wholesome caf√© that deserves a visit (or many!) if you're in Navi Mumbai."
5,"Been here for Sunday morning breakfast. The place has an old world charm to it. Everything here is personal. Nothing done up for aesthetics alone. Jackson, the owner and host is a gem. Excellent service and great music to chill out. You can exchange books here too. I am definitely going back for their Karaoke nights on Saturdays."
1,"Extremely poor service received by the manager of Royal Rasoi Nerul.
To begin with my friend and I were not allowed to sit on the table of our choice at 7 pm today even though the restaurant was almost empty. The manager was arguing and was rude .
Point 2) The portion size of the chicken sizzler we ordered was very less than usual, I know this because I‚Äôm a regular customer. When pointed out to the manager he said we cannot do anything and this is the correct portion size.
Im never going back to this restaurant which does not respect their patrons."
3,"The decor is beautiful. The ambience is family oriented. The food is good. Overall, it's worth it.

Update: The food, service and atmosphere has deteriorated than before and hence I am reducing one star from the rating."
1,"Once you order the food it takes eternity to come to you XD.
Very unprofessional Chef.
don't visit the place when you are hungry. You will end up frustrating. I have order ""Chicken Pot rice"" It's taste like you are fried the rice in pan without adding any ingredients and serve it with some green chillies in it. Apart from the rice, the gravy is taste same. Yet the restaurant charge the full payment, I mean it's fair but someone is paying you for good food and the restaurant keeps unprofessional Chef which doesn't even recorrect the food for their customers.
Instead of this visit ""Upper deck"" which is way better than ""Royal Rasoi"". Never gonna visit this restaurant again."
4,"Great place to hang out with friends and family .. The cooks this place has are good at their job .. very tasty food with nice ambience..
We visit this restaurant frequently and have never been disappointed"
5,"One of my all time favourite places in Navi Mumbai
Great food great ambience and great service
We ordered a soup and 4 starters and a main course
Chicken coriander soup was very flavourful
Fish schezwan and chicken crispy both were excellent starters
Prawns in butter was mild but prawns was slight undercooked
Chicken lollipop in schezwan was the only letdown. Too much of spice and the taste was missing
Had a great time overall"
5,"They serve a variety of interesting shakes and mocktails. They also have a variety of snack items.
The place is small but it's very famous for their food and taste.
We've tried their Chilli Garlic Pop, Dryfruits thick shake and Dark secret cold coffee. All these items were very good.
The staff was very humble, friendly and good at hospitality.
Service was quick.
Satisfied with the service."
5,I ordered there chicken momo and filter coffee that was amazing. Chicken momo was totaly worth it and the coffee too According to price. I would recommond you please try there momo at once atleast. its very tastly and the same time very budget friendly for students. There servicing is also good and the staff's behaviour was very friendly.
4,"A small place enough to accommodate 10 people at a time. Serves some good cold coffee with varied options. Pocket friendly for college and school going students. A good variety of milkshakes.
A sandwich counter for a quick bite always helps. Overall it's a good place to stop by for a quick bite. The staff is friendly and cooperative. Quick service is also available. Pretty popular among college and school going students."
4,"Besides the shakes & ice-creams they have stall for Bhel, Sandwich & Rolls. I tries the plain sandwich and it was good."
1,Poor experince of chocolate shake & french fries...Shake was tastless and poor in quality. Fries were partially cooked. Manager was also fighting with the sandwich stall keeper in front of customers. Pathetic experience.  Don't visit Nerul Cafe Creemy
1,Bad service
5,Best
3,Fresh chicken
5,Nice place
5,The most expensive chicken in the world is sold here
5,"Monginis a brand name which comes with a lot of expectations. We all have been seeing these shops now for the last 22 years at least.
I was not disappointed and they actually exceeded their expectations.
This Monginis shop is not more than 3 years old and the staff is really helping, kudos to them for their services. They made our day even more memorable.
I ordered a special birthday cake with a lot of customisation and the staff at the place politely agreed to whatever can be done and gave ideas as to how to go about it. My order was a jungle theme cake with red velvet base. The cake was tasty,fresh and all the people having it really thoroughly enjoyed it. The cake toppers were edible except two of them which were my last minute requests. Looking at the cake, everyone had the same question 'where did you get it from' and my answer was astonishing to almost all the guests. As far as the pricing is concerned it is as per other competitive shops.
Traditionally all big cakes have a chocolate base but they agreed to my requests to go with a red velvet base. They have a journal of all different designs created by Monginis.They always welcome customers with their special requests."
5,"New Monginis Under New Management.
Best place for in-store and online purchase.
Home Delivery from Swiggy and Zomato makes last minute cake order very convenient."
4,Delicious and tempting cake ‚ô•Ô∏è I totally loved the taste but cake was not spongy bit hard so that was a drawback overall it was still yumüíû
5,Must visit and try the brand cakes . Staff is good .do visit
1,"I bought cake twice from this shop and both the time it wasn't fresh. Horrible cake shop, they sell stale pastries... can't imagine how the birthday cakes would be. Monginis can't sell such bad stuffs under their brand. Disappointing!"
5,
5,"Absolutely the best
It's My favourite place since my childhood for momos and i must say back in 2013 and now in 2023 the taste is almost the same with such a good price,

One of the oldest in Nerul which serves variety of momos.

I ate Chicken fried, paneer fried and steamed paneer momos
Here are my thoughts for the sameüòãüëá

Taste- 4.5/5
Service -4/5 (ready in 10-15 mins)
Quantity - 4.5/5
Funtime-5/5ü§ó

Always great to visit this place with my beloved school friends,
Must recommended üòç"
2,Tried momos here.... 1st thing taste was pathetic. 2nd service was too slow. 3rd its expensive than its neighbour. So in short dint like it.
4,Staff were humble. I had tasted chicken shwarama and momos. Both were upto the mark at the price they sell. Definitely worth trying.
4,This outlet is popular for their momos ans shwarma..great food with enough quantity. Momos  were fresh and tasty.
5,"A small outlet near Dmart in Nerul with best quality and quantity of food. They serve veg and non veg momos too and chicken shawarma. Staff is polite and service is fast. They having facility to seat and eat. One of best momos u will get here. And they also provide chicken soup with momos plate.
Must visit ‚ô•Ô∏èüî•"
4,"We tried this place for the first time. Ordered North Indian Thali & All time Thali. Both were good.
common food items were roti, dal, chole sabji, aloo ki sabji & rice.
All time had paneer sabji, a plate of sev puri & a single papad.
These 2 thali is sufficient for 2 people to share.
Liked the food, it was tasty."
5,"Aloo methi paratha was too good and filling
Also their pav bhaji and chole bhature is so yummy
Also the quantity and quality of food is good."
1,"Food quality was below average.
The quantity was not the same as they kept on display.
Also the taste was so bad that it didn't even deserve to get billed over 100
I have ordered the veg of the day thali that costs me 259.
The chapati was super oily, the chas had too much salt and the taste of mix veg was totally avoidable.

There are too many other options to have in this food court still we chose to have a quality meal over the junk. But if this is quality then definitely junk food will be our priority.

I am working nearby and i visit daily over here, but they don't even try to improve their quality.  This a matter of paying attention

Thanks"
1,"I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place if you are seeking some authentic desi north indian food. The oil used for cooking smells disgusting and by the look of the food, you‚Äôll never feel like eating. Total waste of money."
4,"One of the busy food outlet at the Food Court in Nexus Seawoods Mall, Seawoods Railway Station, Nerul West, Navi Mumbai. Serves only Vegetarian dishes of North Indian, especially Punjabi and Chinese cuisine."
5,"I ordered their special paneer tikka sandwich with mozzarella cheese and a chilly bean patty salad. I'm a fan of their salads. I just wish that the patties were slightly bigger in size. The overall portion for salad is quite good. You will feel full by having single portion. Love their sweet onion, honey mustard, southwest Chipotle and red chilli sauce combination. Worth the money if you want a healthy and tasty option for lunch and dinner. The packaging for salads is also good and environment friendly."
4,"Hungry & want to eat healthy then Subway is the best option. They have a variety in breads, colorful veggies & flavourful patty.

In this outlet, service was slow.

I had a Mexican Patty Subway & it was delightful. It's always a hit among vegetarians."
1,"Ordered a Chicken teriyaki sub in multigrain bread, got a Parmesan oregano instead. Next, there was no teriyaki sauce even. Even upon raising this with the staff, they responded saying they probably missed it.
Real bad service. And even worse quality of food."
1,"Worst experience , Subway staff is so rude &   food quantity is very lesser than other subway."
4,"> This outlet located inside the Grand Central Mall, seawood.
> They serve types of sandwiches,  rolls, salads etc.
> Quick in service.

We had :-
Chicken Salad - It was delicious."
1,"I'm disappointed to say that my experience at The Soup Bowl in Nexus Seawood Mall's food court was underwhelming. I initially planned to try their soups, but after reading the Google reviews, I hesitated. Thankfully, I took the feedback seriously and changed my mind. However, I did decide to give their chocolate pastry a try, hoping it would be a redeeming factor.
Unfortunately, the pastry was a letdown as well. The taste and texture didn't quite meet my expectations. Considering the subpar experience, I wouldn't recommend The Soup Bowl to others. Perhaps they need to revisit their recipes and quality control to improve their offerings."
4,We tried Chicken Manchow Soup here. It tastes good. It is located in Seawoods Nexus Mall. They are consistent with their taste
3,"The outlet is about soup but didn't taste good, the soup in the ramen didn't taste extraordinary. Unexpectingly the chicken salad tasted so well and fresh."
1,"I tried the chicken ramen soup, and it was terrible. Not only was the taste off, but the chicken and egg didn‚Äôt seem fresh. The sushi was even worse. It was a complete waste of money‚Äîdefinitely one to avoid!"
1,"Ramen was the worst. The salad was bearable. The sandwich was average. Overall, I won't recommend you spoil your amazing evening here. AVOID."
5,"Tried Double Egg Double Chicken roll. It was really good.
Filled with chicken and omelette. Must try for ‚Çπ150 It's really heavy and fulfilling."
3,"It was nice , and it was tasty too , but compared to prices it's a bit high, like for veg cheese roll rather than 70 if it's  50 it will be worth giving , and we can come again if it's reasonable and good ."
3,Good place to try kolkata rolls and swarma rolls. Shop should be little more clean to maintain the hygiene.
4,"Good place to have some tasty rolls and shawarma nearby to Kharghar station, as compare to other stalls in Kharghar station Kolkata rolls looks satisfying also maintains hygiene with a original brand as a franchise in Kharghar"
4,"Juicy saucy Rolls!!! üß°üíöüß°
________________________________

As everybody knows, Kolkata rolls are quiet famous for their rolls.
This outlet is located jus outside the Kharghar station, its a takeaway outlet.
No proper sitting place but yes! Delicious food guaranteed!!!

This place has quiet a lot of varieties of rolls to offer..veg..paneer...egg chicken and the option goes on nd on...
The rolls are freshly made in front of you, right from the base of the rolls...
As the base is freshly made its very soft not chewwy...

My personal favourites are

‚ùáÔ∏èChicken egg roll...

‚ùáÔ∏èChicken egg kosha roll...

‚ùáÔ∏èChicken egg mayo roll..

The menu is moderately priced, you can check zomato and other online food ordering sites to grab some discounts.
The menu is not restricted to only rolls, you can try shwarma too

Do opt rolls with Egg, for dat extra soft and fulfilling experience :)

5,Bhagat Tarachand is a good choice when you want to try vegetarian food. We tried their Dahi Papdi Chat. It was good
5,"It is as original as it is in Mumbai it is as good in taste and quality as it is in Mumbai.  My personal favorite is moong dal Halva which is just a divine in itself.
One must definitely try their bhindi fry dal fry and moong dal halwa without any hesitation.

It deals with what your soul need"
3,"Pros:
-clean and hygienic, they wear gloves+head gear while preparing your order
-located inside Grand Central mall Seawoods
-loved the combination of perfectly made tea and awesome flavoured bhel
-pani poori was a little above average in my opinion as I like wheat Puri over rava puri, I may be wrong though

Cons:
-oily bhature were a turn off last time when I visited
-chole were too spicy with too much masala as per my taste or maybe this is how Pindi choles are supposed to be"
4,We order paneer paratha....it's spicy wassnt expecting it to be spicy... Atleast paratha would be good.. expect to be better.Hope they work on it.
4,Loved the biryani quality and paneer tikka was too tasty. But not happy with kabab
1,"""I recently visited Jumbo King ( Nexus Seawoods) and was quite disappointed with the service. The staff was extremely rude and unprofessional in their communication. It felt like they weren't interested in providing good customer service, which really affected the overall experience. While the food was decent, the rude behavior of the staff overshadowed everything else. I hope they improve their customer interaction going forward."""
2,You can eat average quality food in loud noise without speaking to your friends. Better to avoid.
4,This place is located a few feet apart from the Mc outlet but still there is a decent crowd visiting here. Veg only options but still is great. The only drawback this outlet faces is manpower. There was only two staff when we visited there one taking orders and other preparing it due to which there is bit of crowd kept waiting. Whenever the order taker gets free she would jump in to help the other guy. The order handler Girl was very pleasant and handled the customers very well. All in all is a good place with good food.
4,Food is tasty and at the same time affordable.
4,"Famous food chain, having good taste  at low cost, I recommend having butter toast ."
5,"This hotel offers excellent ambience in the spacious and well designed outlet near nerul railway station The food quality and taste is also very good. Its authentic Indian Chinese that we all love. They have both veg n non veg meals. They have fairly well priced food. The rates are affordable

Their ala carte menu is also very good and worth trying if you want the food of your choice."
4,"Tirupati Prasad in Nerul is a mixed bag when it comes to dining experiences. The starters are truly excellent‚Äîwell-prepared, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. They set high expectations right from the beginning.

However, the experience takes a dip when it comes to their biryani, which was disappointing. The flavors lacked depth, and it didn‚Äôt live up to the standards set by the starters.

Overall, it‚Äôs a good spot if you‚Äôre looking for great appetizers, but perhaps skip the biryani if you‚Äôre a connoisseur."
5,"Excellent food, not very expensive. Prompt service
Also, they make very good tea
Which is available even durinh dinner times"
4,This is one of the best hotels in nerul with delicious food at resonable rates.
5,Best place in Navi Mumbai for having local food. They have so many variations in dosa and the other food items like medu vada and idlis are also too good and budget efficient. Plus they also provide cheese stuffed dosas. A must visit place to satisfy your tummy.
1,"Ahmed Bhai- Fear God!

The service and the staff are absolute mawali‚Äôs. The food is hit or miss, I have dined here multiple times and had issues too but drawing the line today. I got served haleem in a chutney container, trust me the food is more expensive than any 5 star celebrity chef restaurants. Got a squeezed lemon, some fried onions in a container of a same size.. it‚Äôs madness. Checkout malpua with double rabdi too."
5,"I have been feeding on there biryanis (especially leg burra biryani, mutton chaap biryani and afghani biryani) since 2015. Haven‚Äôt been disappointed even for a single time because of their soulful taste. Ahmad bhai‚Äôs food has no comparison."
1,"Pathetic experience with respect to food and service.
I had ordered Non veg platter and they served the left over food from previous day for which I complained and they accepted and replaced the items.
Not recommended at all for any kind of meal with family and friends"
1,"I ordered chicken pulao from Swiggy, and it has a stapler pin in it, along with something like black dust in the packaging. What kind of food is this where no attention is given to safety?
Not recommended"
5,I highly recommend Ahmed Bhai's restaurant in Nerul for their exceptional Chapli kebab.  It's a must-visit for anyone seeking authentic Peshawari Chapli kebab in the area.
1,Just now have food but the quality and staff behaviour was not good thought to get hot shawarma but deliver cold shawarma and informed us the it‚Äôs come in cold condition out of brain
3,Service was good but taking so much time to making order because of online oders ... ambiance was ok cheesy shourma was dry because he using normal chess I suggest please use cheesy souce and double was good quality also good üëç
5,"Visited this place last weekend , and oh boy, the quantity served was humongous. I went for the Double Chicken cheese Shawarma and the amount of  Cheese they added was quite impressive. We ordered for the double chicken very peri shawarma, in which the quantity was good but wasn't spicy as we expected. It has a mild flavour of sauces used, would have liked it if it was a bit spicy. Costed us around 340 for two. Overall, a good deal."
5,"One of the best place to end your carving for shwarma.
I had ordered 1.Grillee chicken container
2.Labanese chicken fries
3.Cheese shawarma
Cheese shawarma was amazing. The filling inside the kaboos was yumm. Amount of mayo and cheese the guy had added was worthfull. The best part was khaboos was nice soft which i have never seen at much places.
Grilled chicken container
It was one of the best dish which i loved and would recommend to try it once.
Amount of chicken they had added on it was amazing. Specifically the sauce they used was lit.
Taste was perfect
Labanese chicken fries
Usually there are many sort of fries but this was some thing different. Combination of fried and grilled chicken with mayo was nice.
Overall my experience was amazing.
After a long time i has such a tempting and mouthwatering shawarma.
Highly recommend to try it.

1,Cockroach found in parcel. Pathetic response from the person who received my complaint call. Told him to collect the parcel. Idiot told me to order again from Zomato so that they can collect the parcel with cockroach.
5,Good ambience..fast service and quite popular with college students. Come here for either a quick bite or to have those friendly long group discussions.
4,Good Pizza with Indian flavours.....  Better than pizza Hut or Domino's..... Must try pizza place in Mumbai
2,Not that great pizzas available for a very affordable price.
5,Loved itüòä affordable and Delicious at the same time!
4,Pizza worth a paying... delicious n fresh
4,"We recently visited this place to hog some good delicious junk food üòõ

Its a small eatery place...which can accomodate 16-20 ppl at a time...

Its a zomoto pro patterened restaurant so fetched around 40% discount on dine in...
Coming to the food...
We tried chicken bbq garlic bread nd chicken feast pizza which we converted into cheese burst!!

The pizza was very good...the amount of Chicken in it was nice!!!
As it was chicken feast pizza...it had chicken bbq.chicken salami...chicken keema nd other veggies like olives in it...
As i m not a thin crust base fan so we went for thick regular base...cheese burst conversion was best decision...it made it too yum!!!

The bbw garlic bread was also good...

Coming to the thing which we didn't like...
The prices mentioned on the menu were exclusive of taxes..nd on bill nd on menu the base prices also differed...seeing the gst extra on bill hits different....

Its better' to mention taxes inclusive menu!!!"
5,"A very basic small and cheaper option to hop on for your cheesy cravings. If you're bored with the usual pizza brands in Nerul then this is the place for you The taste they have is just awesome and melting when served hot. This pizza station is very well famous for there amazing online service too so you can always notice some delivery boys waiting outside. They also have other options like sandwiches, pasta, burgers. The chocolate mousse is worth a try. My personal favourite are the hot chicken and chicken bonanza. There's no enough comfy seatings available so many prefer take away but still the taste makes it difficult to resist from trying there different varieties of pizzas üçï"
5,"These guys serve amazing cheese burst pizzas so delicious and filled with lots of cheese and topped with fresh veggies. I liked the quantity which I got in a medium cheese burst pizza which was more than sufficient for 3 people easily.
I ordered
1. Sizzling Paneer Cheese Burst Pizza
2. Mushroom Garlic Bread
3. Chocolava Cake
The Chocolava Cake was yummy to and you should definitely try it along with your meal.
I didn't like the Mushroom Garlic Bread though it was fresh and fluffy but still didn't like the combination I guess. Everything else was perfect."
5,"Do you go throught days that make you want to buy a pizza? Like a huge cheese burst Pizza with truck loads of Toppings!!

Yeah that was the kind of day I was going through when I ordered from Pizza Caprina which is located near to my office.

Unexpectedly, the pizza was huge and the toppings were in such a good quantity that you would feel worth paying for it unlike some other Pizza's who have countable toppings ü§™

My order:
Cheeseburst Chicken Feast Pizza.
Garlic bread BBQ supreme ( chicken on this one was so good!!)
Choco Lava Cake (Drooool worthy!! It's awesome)

Packaging was very good!! I asked them to pack it properly and they really made an effort for me! Also the delivery is fast.

One of my friend suggested that you also try their Plain BBQ chicken Pizza.. She loves it. So u might too!

Have a great day!!

Follow me on Instagram @cakesncurrys üòç"
4,"So decided to try out pizza from a different outlet than a regular one, and i promise you I wasn't disappointed at all, loved the pizza very much, I chose the supreme chicken pizza which had good amount of filling, the cheese surprise inside it made me drool over itüòçüòç, and the quantity is really sufficient for 3..
Next i tried their Chicken bologinis - this one was amazing, do go for it‚úîÔ∏èüòçüòç
I ended my meal with choco lava cake, omg it was sooo good, loved itüòãüòã"

5,"Good place for a quick bite. They have cakes, pastries, brownies, donuts, hotdogs, puffs, samosas, fudges, chocobombs, gift items, customised products, keychains & much more. Good & different variety of cakes at affordable prices. Quality is not so good but manageable. I had chocotella brownie today but it was very flaky & hard from inside. Otherwise it is a decent place with decent price & manageable quality cakes."
5,"Quite an old household name for cakes & celebration. Few years back their quality had declined but thankfully they are back with the original quality and taste.
Love to order up monginis pastries which are pretty easy on the pocket & taste delicious.
They have Savoury options like pizza, rolls, puff pastry, pattice ,wafer, packaged swiss rolls, muffins etc.
My personal favourites are :
- devils delight üåü
- zebra torte üåü
- black forest üåü
- dutch pastry üåü
- chicken roll üåü
- veg & nonveg square pizzaüåü"
1,Had ordered a black forest cake on the phone. The person in charge just gave my ordered cake to someone else without verifying. Ruined my planned occasion
5,"Shop is good and near by to Nerul Station,
Varieties are Good,
Polite Staff behaviour
All most every thing is good"
1,I came from juinagar to nerul station to pre-booking cake for tomorrow but staff was having very cheap behavior and attitude also he denied to talk with us.  We're at 10:30pm and just we need to talk with him for 2 minutes but he told us no no close
3,"Food was decent, unfortunately it was a weekend and had a long waiting (approximately 30 mins).
Had ordered a fish thali along with mutton thali.
The fish thali was good with good and fresh piece and a half of fried surmai.
The gravy went well with the so called bhakri (reminded me of neer dosa) but was better combination with the rice.
The mutton thali was a bit of a let down (that's y the lower star).
The quality of the mutton was not that good, mostly bones and didn't justify the price tag.
But the masala was good and went great with the wade.
The solkadi was ok."
4,"The food was nice.. service was good. We had to wait for around 15-20 mins since we visited at 9.00 pm. The food was a little spicy for our taste but overall I liked it! The ac was on full blast so it was quite cold. Recommend : CHICKEN TIKKA BIRYANI, SPL. MUTTON THALI, SPECIAL FISH THALI, MANDELI FRY.
Overall rating: 4/5"
4,"Clean and tidy place, service was fast, humble staff. We have ordered Fish Platter, king fish and prawns thali, food was delicious. Regarding atmosphere, kitchen is next to sitting area (completely packed AC room) so sitting area fills with smell of kitchen n i felt a little suffocated"
4,Small seafood restaurant in Seawoods. The place is small but good enough for small groups. Food is amazing.
5,Best Maharashtrian (konkani) food..
5,"I just love this place, best rolls in navi mumbai. I visit  kolkata rolls seawoods outlet atleast once in a week.  Now they have started with momos, tried them today and it was awesome. They also offer chicken with paratha and chicken biryani. I just love visiting this place. Full pointsüëèüëè"
3,"This place is good for chinese lovers.
Their speciality in chinese food is quite good.
Also the Dum Biryani has taste and in affordable price they provide.
Their accent from Kolkata they provide with Onion.(some kind of secret ingredient with oil spreaded over onion) And that's just awesome. People from Kolkata surely will not mis this while getting food from it.
Pepper Tawa and Chicken Barbeque they provide in starters and it tastes so good im missing the taste currently ! I just loved it.
And their rolls are also fingerlickin üòç
The quantiy and size of the rolls might low & small but it has taste that's it.
You'll love this place.‚ù§"
5,"Ordered chicken biryani from Kolkata rolls seawoods.Quantity and quality are good.Nice aroma and smells exactly like Kolkata biryani.
Price is decent and asked for leg piece over phone after placing order from swiggy and they provided the same.

Ordered for 4 to 5 times and everytime they provided good quality and quantity.

Love the taste and smell."
5,"I can't get enough of the Kosha Rolls at Kolkata Rolls Seawood! The combination of perfectly spiced tender meat and the softest rolls is a match made in heaven. The flavors are incredibly authentic, reminding me of the streets of Kolkata. The service is friendly, and the ambiance is welcoming. This place is a must-visit for all the roll lovers out there!"
5,"One of the most beloved and affordable fast food outlet in kharghar. It has veg well as non veg varieties and best part is it is pocket friendly. Excellent for quick service and taste. Chicken kosha and Paneer kosha Rolls are the specialities in here. Do visit this place once you go to Kharghar, Navi Mumbai"
2,"It is one of the ok ok type resturent in my bucket list but for breakfast only. Food quality and quantity is  totally worth it according to price. But serviceing is not good at all. Some foods are not available like coconut Barfi, Milk cake, Pani puri, Sav puri etc but still in menuüôÑ. Clean atmophere but sitting arrangement is totally bad. You need to wait min 15 to 45 min for sits. And then aftet getting a sit u have to wait for max 30 min to get food on ur table which is very horriable for us like clg nd office going people. I just go there jst for eating 1 dish(CHOLE BHATURE)üôÇ. I wont say u will fall in love with it but u should try it once."
5,"One of my favourite places for a quick detour. I'd recommend chole bhature, samora and chai if u ever come here."
4,"It is good but not for lunch or dinner. It is only for breakfast or snacks. Samosa and tea you must try to get relief from stressful life.

It is the perfect spot if you are in for breakfast or snacks. The samosa and chai is best combo that you can try out here also the service is really good. Try out this place if you want to experience traditional snacks of the best quality."
5,"Best chai samosa in Navi Mumbai.
Must try items.
Onion utappa with tomato chutney
Cheese pav bhaji
Fafda chutney
And all the sweets"
1,I oder to samosa 40qty but only samosa given does not given in chatni and mirachi
5,Everyone who lives in Navi Mumbai should be a Member of this Beautiful Club and Enjoy the Facilities. Must Visitüëç
5,"I visited Nerul Gymkhana on 29/01/2023, as our office had arranged a cricket match out here. The ground was good and clean. There is ample of parking spaces available. The staff was very helpful and polite. The gymkhana has lots of amenities, like swimming pool, etc."
5,I‚Äôve had a great experience with my swimming classes! Coach Gaurav is incredibly supportive and attentive. Safety precautions are always taken. Highly recommend!
1,"Hi, same experience with me as well and when I highlighted this they started arguments without accepting their mistakes.
The fees charged for these swimming classes are excessively high compared to the poor quality of training provided. Basic techniques like breathing, floating, and correct body posture are either skipped or poorly taught, showing a complete lack of structure and professionalism. The instructors are not patient or skilled enough to guide beginners effectively, and the sessions feel rushed with little focus on actual learning or progress. There is no individual attention or constructive feedback, making it difficult for learners to improve. The classes are often disorganized, and the facility does not justify the premium pricing. Overall, it feels like the priority is completing sessions rather than building real swimming skills. This place is definitely not worth the money and is not recommended for anyone serious about learning to swim."
4,"Pool is okay a bit crowded, they claim it to be Olympic size with 7.5ft depth but in actual it's only 5ft depth and size of pool is also very less. Standard size of olympic size swimming pool have minimum depth of around 2m(6ft7in)"
1,"No Hygenic, No server on your table, they only come if u give them a new order otherwise they won't listen you, See the uploaded chicken Fry it looks good and tasty but that was salty, Kachumbar (Raitha) lots of water only it and taste less, The oil which used by them to fry chicken and cutlets are seems to be old. See the chicken fry plates before the cook its placed in open place no hygenic, biriyani no that much as expected."
2,"I had onion bhajiya and the samosa and the Lassi..
The onion bhajiya was little hard since it was made previously and then reheated using the microwave and it was super oily which I don't like
This was different kind of samosa .I wasn't fan of it
The good part was the Lassi which was amazin on hot summers day"
1,"The taste and quality has degraded over time.
The biryani was cold and felt like we were served leftovers. The chicken pieces was just fat and bone no meat. No taste whatsoever just bland oil.
The cutlet was drained in oil taste was okay.
Affordable but inedible."
4,Tikka biryani is the one you must try. Overall its good and value for money.
3,Biryani everyday and dalgost Friday Monday Wednesday and Saturday mutton biryani is very popular in Nerul
5,"Taste of the cake was good, even they offered complitary match box and candles with cake."
1,"The cakes here are literally stale happened more than 3 times

I bought cake for my sister's birthday
The cake was stale which spoiled the bday
The next day i informed the staff
They said  ""you should have brought the cake
Now you ate the cake we cannot do anything"""
1,"Horrible service, if i could rate in negative stars i would. I had pre-ordered a cake to be delivered. The delivery person delivered it at the wrong address, showed utter ignorance at our calls regarding not recieving the cake. We had to search for the cake ourselves where it was delivered, the delivery person as well as the owner were very rude and showed no sense of responsibility whatsoever. Basic etiquette as to how to talk a customer or another human being as a matter of fact is the bare minimum expected. Would never visit this place and would highly advise against ordering anything from this place. They take the money beforehand and couldn't care less whether delivered at the correct address or not!"
5,The Sardarji is very good and honest Baker and offers fresh items only
1,Very bad taste just today 01/05/23 we bought a pastry and it was  sour very bad
5,"We visited this restaurant based on public review. As seen in few videos we found the owner warmly welcoming us. We ordered food as per our plan 1) Mutton Samosa, 2) Murg Musallam, 3) Mutton Biryani, 4) Kulfi, 5) Firni. The food portion can be increased but it was very delicious. Mutton Samosas are small but tasty. My children were happy to visit this restaurant and delighted by the service. Valet parking is available. It was a great experience ! Worth visiting !"
4,One of the legendary restaurants in Mumbai‚Ä¶ visited this place after 12 years‚Ä¶ had dinner and the food was amazing‚Ä¶ the service was also fantastic‚Ä¶ it was Iftar time so we had a bit of wait which was not at all an issue‚Ä¶ very polite and friendly staff‚Ä¶ will surely be visiting again‚Ä¶ the honking of the vehicles on the road is the only minor bother‚Ä¶
5,"We were hungry and decided to order Chicken Chilli Kabsa Rice and Arabic Custard.

The moment we tasted the rice, we were absolutely blown away by how delicious it was. We ate to our heart's content and still had some leftovers, which we happily packed to take home. The quantity was generous enough to easily serve three people.

The dessert, Arabic Custard, was equally impressive. It had a unique and delightful taste that stood out, making it a perfect end to the meal.

Overall, it was a fantastic dining experience that left us thoroughly satisfied and impressed.
Worth every penny.

10/10 highly recommend."
5,"We recently dined at Lucky Restaurant and were impressed! The restaurant's warm atmosphere and prompt service made our experience enjoyable. The Mutton Chops, Chicken Pahadi Kebab and Prawns Biryani showcased exceptional flavors and presentation.

Unfortunately, the desserts, particularly the Lucky Special Faluda and Fruit Salad with Ice Cream, lacked richness and flavor. Improving dessert quality would elevate the overall experience. Friendly staff, cleanliness and generous portions were notable positives. We'll definitely return for their signature dishes!"""
4,One star less for noisy ambience since the restaurant is situated just beside cross roads. (I think they should have one transparent glass door at the entrance which will solve this issue) otherwise good food. I ordered Mutton biryani and it was quite good.
5,"If you're in Mahim/Dadar area and are looking for inexpensive nonveg food and booze then look no further.. Starters, main course, soups all are worth trying and alcohol is available in quarter system.. It's rarely packed inspite of what I've mentioned above so you rarely have to wait for you table.. Overall a place I would like to repeat"
4,"The quantity and quality both, of the Chicken Triple rice was absolutely amazing. The rice was well cooked and soft in consistency. The soup with triple was a mix of sweet and spicy taste, with veggies and ample amount of chicken pieces in the soup. The packaging was great, you don't have to use a separate utensil for eating the rice. Just grab a spoon, open the containers and start the process of eating :P"
2,"Rated Grade I Bar & Restaurant! M sure those days this would have been good enough to get the grade, but not anymore i guess!

To be frank I haven't had good experience here. Food was average and most important I ordered a foreign beer, it's manufacture date sticker was removed but the price tag was thr! When asked to the management they gently said that, they also haven't noticed that! I got my beer replaced with Indian one, but this is dangerous! I strongly suspect that was expired product!!!!

So be careful of the stuff, rest is almost good here."
4,"Excellent place for Chineseeee..I had ordered several times from Midland China..its value for Money & very satisfying experienceüòç

Today I ordered Roasted Chicken Fried Rice..it's just awesome. Also I tried Chicken in Coriander Sauce & thier Sichuan Vermicelli Noodles which was a killer of a deal!

Thank u for Complementary Crystal Chicken Dimsum..just Loved it..too yumm..!!

I would surely recommend this place  for authentic Chinese Foodüòçüòç"
5,"Good restaurant provided you know what you are looking for. If you go well researched, you are rest assured to exit with defined satisfaction, or else the experience can be exactly the opposite of what you expected. Me being a foodie, I had no problems in making menu decisions. The good points lies in food preparation. Less oil and relatively healthier menu that brings a smile on a fitness addict like me. Its a hop, skip and jump from my place which brings a good lot of convenience. The owner Mr. Shetty and the manager Mr. Karna are extremely friendly & can help you decide on the menu. The bad side of this place could be the staff (for some). Most are new and can confuse someone who is a first-timer at this place. The best dishes here are the Tandoori items and I can compare them to any quality grill in Mumbai. My favorite item is Mushroom tikka. Absolutely Lip-smacking.My go-to place."
5,"Great service and atmosfer , Sushi wasn't that good but still ok"
5,"Escobar - A gem located at Linking Road Bandra West.
The best place to party on weekends and also to enjoy dinners with family and friends.
Loved the rooftop terrace. It has beautiful view of the city.
It has one of the longest bars in India and also one of the first restaurants in India serving Tapas.
Loved every minute of being here.
I totally enjoyed the amazing exotic cocktails made by the bartender.
The turnip cake, Dimsums and fried tofu were amazing, but what has my heart is the  Veg Dragon Sushi. It was the best Sushi I ever had.
Mains we had the blue pea buttered rice, sliced fish with Chilly oil and stir fried vegetables
The Escobars Legendary Dessert platter has to be the best.
It has an assortment of ice creams, TiraMisu, fruits, chocolate mud cake with vanilla ice cream.
Must visit!"
5,"This is a nice place to hangout , you get option for indoor and outdoor sitting , both are awesome.. you need to pay covercharge also drinks and foods are bit on expensive end.. place is loud and its hard to chit chat .. each item will be above ‚Çπ800 (avg), also drinks are on costlier side .
We two friends ended up with a bill amount of 18k , 8large and two chicken item. But place is good
Ambience is food, music selection is good, you get good names in the menu, it has a big floor for dance , and to add all to this it has outdoor sitiiing with music too along with terrace .
Must go place with friends to rock"
5,"Escobar club is an absolute gem in the nightlife scene. The music selection is outstanding and had me dancing all night. The atmosphere is electric and the trendy decor adds to the overall experience. The service is impeccable, with friendly staff who made me feel welcomed. The drinks are delicious and made to perfection. The crowd is lively and diverse, creating a vibrant energy. The club layout is spacious and comfortable, with ample seating and a great dance floor. The security is excellent and makes you feel safe. Overall, Escobar club is a must-visit for a fun and unforgettable night out."
1,"We went on Saturday night which I assume would be so much fun but the ambiance was not at all good, food was average, music choice was poor and not at all loud. People who are coming from NCR will not be able to enjoy there as in NCR there are much much much better clubs and bars which are way too less expensive from this one. If you want to book table they will cost 10k for 2 persons and overall food and drinks are also expensive."
3,"I recently revisited this upscale Chinese restaurant for brunch, despite previous underwhelming experiences. Unfortunately, the lack of natural light and overuse of tacky blue lights remained a major turnoff. The ambiance, while appealing to some, doesn‚Äôt  resonate with me.
The food, while reasonably priced during brunch, didn't change my opinion about Chinese cuisine in Bombay. It still feels like a generic Chinese restaurant in a five-star hotel.

On a positive note, the staff was attentive and well-trained, with noticeably more staff members on deck. The addition of a smoking cabin upstairs was convenient, and the toned-down music was a welcome change. The unlimited flow of good brand cocktails was a great value.

While this restaurant still isn't my favorite, I appreciate the positive changes in price, smoking area, and music volume."
4,"It's a beautiful restaurant with some decent food. I don't understand some of the menu items that are listed as cooked in or with a sauce, but the actual dish is actually dry. The restaurant was happy to provide the sauce as a side with the dish, which was welcome. The main reason for 1 less star is the service. For some reason, the serving staff were uncomfortable with us choosing to serve ourselves. We declined for them to serve the dishes out as we had some diners who don't eat certain foods like mushrooms and capsicums, so we prefer to serve ourselves. Despite having told one particular server that we're fine to help ourselves, she kept wanting to serve us, which really killed the mood and made it uncomfortable, like we were doing something wrong."
5,Brilliant set menu for lunch delicious and sumptous.The ambience is too good full party vibes.The service courteous n prompt.A must go for pan a oriental cuisine experience.great dimsums n deserts n stir fries.Can visit again.
5,"This is my second visit to Hakkasan. As always, brilliant food and even better service. The staff were pleasant in particular, Apam, which lifted the overall experience. Had the pleasure of meeting the man behind the scene Chef Raymond. Special thanks to Dhananjay Gowda for making the experience even more memorable with his recommendations to suit all our fussy palettes."
4,"Had the pleasure of dining at Hakkasan in Mumbai, and I have to say, the atmosphere is fantastic. The setting is modern and sleek, with comfortable seating and a stylish bar that creates a welcoming vibe. It‚Äôs definitely one of the top Chinese restaurants in Mumbai, but while the ambiance is spot on, it doesn‚Äôt quite deliver in terms of traditional Chinese authenticity.

The staff were friendly and attentive, always ready to assist. We ordered the Peking duck, which was, unfortunately, underwhelming. The preparation was just okay‚Äîthe skin wasn‚Äôt crispy, and the duck itself was on the smaller side but came from Thailand. Traditionally, the creases would be used for a soup or stir-fry, but they were left unused here. A bit disappointing considering the cost and overall taste.

On a positive note, the dim sum was quite good, and I was impressed by how they cater to a wide range of dietary preferences, with no lard used in their offerings. We also tried the stir-fried buffalo, which was surprisingly delicious‚Äîtender, not too gamey, and packed with flavor.

The drinks were excellent, and it would‚Äôve been nice to see the tea served personally as needed, perhaps with a selection of puer on the menu for added depth?

As for dessert, I think they could elevate the experience by adding some authentic Chinese options instead of just only the Western-style desserts.

The desserts, while good, leaned more towards Western-style offerings. I would love to see some traditional Chinese desserts added to the menu for an authentic touch.

All in all, it was a very enjoyable experience. The service was excellent, and the atmosphere was top-notch, though there‚Äôs room for improvement in the authenticity and food preparation. Still, I would recommend it for a refined and relaxed dining experience in Mumbai."
4,"Decent place to hit the gym and then swim in the pool.
There is not much crowd here at the gym, you practically have the whole gym to yourself where you can focus on your workouts without having to wait for the equipment.
They should fix the surround sound though, you can still play music via the TV.
The pool is decent size of about 25m in length. They offer coaching classes as well as Aqua yoga."
1,"I have to say, my visit to C'est La Vie on Hill Road, Bandra, through my Fitpass membership was nothing short of a nightmare. This place is an absolute disgrace. From the shady, dilapidated entrance to the gym‚Äôs basement location, everything screams neglect. The gym equipment is ancient, rusted, and downright dangerous. It feels like a health hazard rather than a place to work out. The dumbbells are corroded, many machines are out of order, and the whole place has a creepy, unkempt vibe.

The state of the bathrooms is appalling‚Äîthey smell like a filthy public restroom and are in desperate need of cleaning and maintenance. The mirrors are stained, the floors are grimy, and the entire facility looks like it hasn‚Äôt seen a renovation since the early 2000s.

To make matters worse, the annual membership fee of 40,000 INR is a complete rip-off for such a shoddy, outdated facility. There are plenty of better, more modern gyms in the area at a fraction of the cost.

This place is a total scam and a health risk. Save your money and avoid this gym at all costs. I hope the management takes this feedback as constructive criticism and considers renovating the gym to improve the equipment and overall environment."
5,"A bit confusing when you try getting to this place, it seems to be called Amanze now I guess. The place is different from all the other cafes/lounge bars you may have seen before. It's a rooftop setting with a pool in the middle and the seating arranged around the edges to give you a different feeling."
4,"The place is located in a resident area so the music performances are done with less sounds the ambience is top notch , also the food is here superb the pool is available to those who make some billing."
3,Amanzi sky deck located on the 3rd floor of C'set La Vie is a cool place to hangout with friends and for parties. Build around a pool one of its main decks are located on top of swimming pool which is glass bottom.
5,"Crazy place..! The place is like maze.. quite unique ambience and architecture impressive indeed. Atmosphere hear is great. They have outdoor sitting and indore Airconditionered sitting area. During day time its quite hot outdoor.

Food is good lot of options for backery and Sweet items.
Great place to hangout with friends ."
3,"Candies is more about the atmosphere than the food. The vibes here hit differently, it‚Äôs the kind of place people visit more for the aesthetic than the dining experience. With plenty of Instagram-worthy spots, it‚Äôs perfect for those looking to capture some great pictures. I especially liked the tile work, which gives off a Moroccan feel, adding to the cafe‚Äôs charm.
However, when it comes to food and service, it‚Äôs pretty average. Don‚Äôt bother checking the menu online before heading there, as you can only order what‚Äôs available on display. While the overall experience was decent, it would have been much better if the food lived up to the ambiance."
5,"A very good place to hang out with a group of friends. The atmosphere the interior is amazing so colorful and such a nice and large space to hang out with friends. I went there in the evening around 4 o‚Äôclock, I suggest going there after 6 PM. I only had two deserts the New York cheesecake and the Russian honey cake. I loved the Russian honey cake, but I did not like New York cheesecake it literally tasted like Srikant. I have tried their blueberry cheesecake before and it was amazing.

Overall a nice place to hang out with your friends in the evening with amazing food."
5,"A Delightful Haven for Treats and Snacks

This charming venue is a paradise for food lovers, offering a wide array of delicious treats and snacks. The atmosphere is thoughtfully designed, with a variety of seating arrangements that cater to both cozy gatherings and larger groups, making it a perfect spot for any occasion.

I had the pleasure of visiting during Christmas, and I was truly captivated by the stunning decorations that transformed the place into a winter wonderland. The festive ambiance added a magical touch to my dining experience. Despite the peak holiday rush, the staff managed to maintain excellent service, ensuring that every guest felt valued and attended to.

Whether you're in the mood for savory bites or sweet indulgences, the diverse menu is sure to satisfy every palate. The prices are surprisingly reasonable, making it accessible for everyone to enjoy a memorable meal.

Additionally, convenient roadside parking is available, making it easy to pop in and relish the delightful offerings. Overall, this is a place where you can unwind and savor amazing food in a beautiful setting‚Äîdefinitely a must-visit!"
4,"Candies Cafe in Bandra boasts a truly Instagrammable ambiance, with its beautifully decorated interiors and ample seating capacity. The cafe is a visual feast, making it a perfect spot for those who love to capture and share their dining experiences. While the aesthetics are undeniably impressive, I found the food to be somewhat overpriced for the quality. I tried the chicken lasagna, which was unfortunately only average in flavor. Despite this, Candies Cafe remains a worthwhile destination for its unique charm and vibrant atmosphere. I recommend visiting at least once to experience the ambiance firsthand also got to experience a stand up show that too free of cost"
3,"Came here on Monday night and was very dead. I think we chose the wrong day.
Locating the place is a task as u have to go into small allies and ask so many people to locate the bar.
Situated on the second floor there is a dirty lift which is quite scary.
It's a roof top set up quite popular with college goers and tourist people.
We ordered fries and momos which were decent. since there were only two tables full service was fast.
There was a 99 rs drink offer that was ongoing so it was very economical. If u r nearby and looking for an affordable place then go for it"
4,"The place has a good Vibe, it was quite packed on a Saturday night. Service was good. Food was a bit pricey. Music was really good. They had a very big outside area and a small dance floor inside area. Place can get a bit difficult to find. A small lift goes up to the 2nd Floor. The one star less is for the smelly dance floor and very dirty and cramped Toilets. Overall a good experience but I think I would prefer a weekday."
4,"Great place to visit over weekend. Music is good, quality of food is okay. Since its filled fully over weekend, table might be difficult and service will take some time. Food quality definitely can definitely get better. Ample options for alcohols, good options are okay too."
5,"Always a great watering hole! Been coming here for years.

The music they play isn‚Äôt really my vibe but it‚Äôs just a personal preference.

The tiny lift to get in/blocked stairs are a disaster waiting to happen."
5,Great roof top bar. With fabtastic cocktails. Nice and chilled out Tuesday drink. Was busy for a weekday night. Definitely would recommend
1,"The hygiene standards at this Domino's Pizza outlet are below par. The lack of cleanliness in the kitchen and the absence of gloves worn by chefs are concerning. It's important for food establishments to maintain high hygiene standards to ensure customer safety and satisfaction. It is shocking that fssai can let them run this outlet. I would recommend everyone to NEVER eat from here. I did voice my concerns to the staff as well. However, they had no reply. The outside seating area was dirty and looked like it hadn‚Äôt been cleaned for days. Horrifying!"
1,"Very bad experience, pizza has no flavour at all, aslo the veggies were bad and sour in taste we every thing went in dustbin very dirty veggies did not expected this not hygienic at all  also the place is very dirty they didn't even clean the sitting area,"
1,"Very pathetic service and bad experience ordered 3 pizzas from this outlet my order was accepted at 10.46 and also got an order number and order was also shown as preparing however after 15 mins order was shown as delayed by 17 mins but i still waited for the order it was almost 45 mins and when i checked it was past 11 and the outlet was shut without delivering my order, my money was debited and no customer support was available as all the contact numbers were switched off unbelievable service from dominos will never order from dominoz"
1,"Terrible experience with Domino‚Äôs!
Waited 1 hour 20 minutes for my order despite their bold claim of ""30 minutes delivery"" ‚Äî what‚Äôs the point of that promise if it‚Äôs never honored?  Finally  had to cancel the order ... Even the number  provided isn't working...This isn‚Äôt the first issue either. In a previous vegetarian order, they sent me chicken by mistake ‚Äî completely unacceptable. They assured me they‚Äôd compensate with coupons, but never received anything.
Very disappointed with the service and lack of accountability"
1,Table is very dusty no cleaning maintenance done too dusty and hygiene issues at sitting table this  i i have clean the dust
3,This place was in my list for a long time. I am sure they have good other pizzas but the one we ordered was seriously bad as in the mushroom tasted off and the wheat pizza had an odd taste and I couldn't finish a slice. We ordered the veg one. The wedges were alright and the salad was alright . I wouldn't give in to the reviews. It was however nice to find a table on Sat night where most of the places are super full with long lines. Wouldn't go here again.
4,"went there on Christmas, and the vibes were great. we got a place surprisingly, and ordered their special pepperoni pizza, and pesto pasta. for starters we got the chicken tenders, but they were greasy to a point where we could not continue eating them without sacrificing everything that was to come after. the pizza was nothing special, the sauce was a bit underwhelming. the pesto pasta absolutely slapped though. i think they used indian basil to make it, and the flavour was uniquely earthy and sweet. we ended our meal with an apple pie, and it has to be one of the best apple pies ive ever eaten. will definitely visit them again."
4,"A hidden gem in Bandra that probably deserves more credit than it gets. The pizza isn't traditional Italian by any means but its crispy and packed full of flavour. The garlic bread is also a must order, so much garlic flavour."
3,"Decent pizza. The masale they speak so highly of was not be tasted much but the story about the grandma was nice to read; do add the masala though to the pizza or give it on the side to sprinkle. Also, the ‚Äòtandoori paneer‚Äù didn‚Äôt have any tandoor taste to it."
1,"Hands down, this is our fave pizza eatery when we are in Mumbai, and I ordered my pizza for delivery as I usually do from Ray's - only to find that the box had been tipped, or dropped, by the delivery guy! And this is their own delivery service - not Zomato, or swiggy! So the base was crisp and overcooked, and the toppings had slid off the pizza base and were stuck to the cardboard, making the pizza inedible. It was quite late when I ordered but there were still 20 mins before they closed - I called, and got no reply. I sent a message through their website, and got no reply. So I am sharing pics here."
5,"I recently visited Soma for the delicious manglore food. Had this fantastic 5 course meal with soup, amuse bouche, palate cleaner, mains, appetizer and dessert.

It was authentic, with great flavors and textures.

I would love to go back here for more Indian and regional food."
1,Their managers and team leaders should do internship at Taj / ITC / Oberoi group of hotels to learn basics of Etiquette and Hospitality.  Extremely disappointing.
2,"I recently visited Soma at the Grand Hyatt and had a mixed experience. The highlight of our meal was undoubtedly the assorted veg tandoori platter, which was delicious and paired perfectly with the soft and fresh romali roti. The flavors were spot on, and it was a delight for the taste buds.

However, the service left much to be desired. It seemed the restaurant was understaffed, and we found ourselves repeatedly calling for service. Despite requesting cut lemons, they never arrived at our table. No one checked in to see how our meal was, which is an essential part of good service. Additionally, when we asked one server for the menu, it never came, and we had to request it from another server.

These service issues need significant improvement to match the quality of the food. Attention to customer service is crucial, and Soma needs to address these lapses to provide a complete dining experience."
5,"We dined at the Indian restaurant Soma. The food was lovely. We ordered simple Indian food, dal's and aloo Gobi and kasoori chicken tikka, and Roti's. Everything was cooked Perfectly. The chicken pieces were juicy, tender. The aloo Gobi was soft and spiced very well. The Indian deserts were well done too, not overly sweet at all. The only thing I didn't enjoy was my cup of filter coffee, it tasted like ordinary coffee.
The staff is courteous and friendly too. Enjoyed their service."
2,"Food was flavorful and tasty but nothing that I have not tasted earlier nor in terms of presentation it was delightful, hence did not find its worth. Secondly service was pathetic, we did not feel welcomed. No one to come and check on you for longtime after you are seated at table. Even in between we had to wait for some server to be around so that we can ask for any additional thing, even as small as cut lemon, salt or pepper.
Ambience is not so great too, it's actually in open area so there is lot of noise from The Bar and lobby section.
Overall not a place I would recommend or myself will go second time. For this price range there are much better options."
4,"Visited this place through happenstance.

We‚Äôre trying to visit some other sizzler outlet in SoBo.

The place has a valet service.

Staff was courteous & washrooms were clean.

The service was quick.

We ordered a garden variety sizzler & they were able to accommodate our dietary restriction of without onion.

Value for money & the ambience was good.

Definitely recommend.

Apparently the place has existed here for 25 years & has a loyal base"
4,"We went with high expectations and, overall, the service was quick. The restaurant was kind enough to accommodate our large group at the last minute, which was really helpful. The food was good and definitely filled us up. However, we were a bit disappointed with the brownie sizzler‚Äîit was very basic and didn‚Äôt have the nuts and cream we were expecting, so it lacked a little pizzazz. The staff wasn‚Äôt the most hospitable, but it wasn‚Äôt a huge issue. Still a decent experience overall!"
5,"The food was freshly cooked, delicious and sumptuous.  The aroma of a fresh sizzler made us so hungry that we polished off the whole thing in 10 min. Would definitely revisit!"
5,"The original and best place to come for sizzlers. Located opposite the Yatch Club and St Andrew Church. They have two levels of seating.
The service is super fast and this place can get busy on the weekend.
They have valet parking so you don't need to worry as Hill Road can get congested to find parking on your own.
The service and staff is very friendly and helpful.
They also have very clean and well kept washrooms.
If you are not a big eater then one sizzler is good enough for two people to share.
They have veg as well as non veg options.
Best to go with family and friends."
4,"This place is mainly famous for sizzlers. We also get other options like Chinese, or sandwich ,  starters etc.

Ambience is ok. But because everyone ordered sizzlers the whole place had smoke everywhere and it also smelled like smoke.

I was lucky to get table on the first floor .

Food was ok. But what I really enjoyed was the salad that they served as sides. Veg and non veg both options are available.

The staff is good.

For lunch I spent 2000 for 3 people which I felt is reasonable because in Mumbai  rates are high in comparison to other places."
5,"Managed to get into Olive by getting one of the team to book, its always advised as it does get busy.

The decor is lovely, the chilled out vibe feel...there's enough pics out there already.

The food is the differentiator....started with Grill Prawns, which was pleasantly surprising, really enjoyed it.

Then I opted for the Chicken, that came on a long skewer, but was nicely put onto a plate for me....really excellent.

Finished it off with the Choc Fondu, why wouldn't you üò¨

The manager Neelum also popped round for a chat, which was great to see...making sure food was to standard and customers were happy. Being a chef, Neelum clearly had standards she wanted the staff to maintain.

Great team, excellent service and vibrant atmosphere. Definitely a place to visit."
5,"Olive Bar & Kitchen is one of the few restaurants in Mumbai which has survived the tough competition of new ones over the years. The occasion was my birthday and the family chose this place. We preferred to sit outdoor due to pleasant weather. We started with Sensi Pinot Grigio white wine. Then we had Olive Mezze Platter, Vegetable Stew with Couscous, Mushroom Risotto and Cottage Cheese Espetadas. The food and wine both were very good. The d√©cor was very classy both indoor and outdoor. The ambiance was top notch. The service was great.
A place worth visiting..."
5,Walked in here for a night out and had the best time ever and met some great ppl. All were friendly here. Danced the night away! Not been here for a meal‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs one for another time. But for a night after dinner this is a perfect place to be at ü•Ç
5,The staff is very friendly and food excellent. Wide range of wines from all over the world. The lamb shank were an winner.
5,"Very much aesthetic. You will have to think that which part must be photo bombed more. Ambience was soo relaxing. Food was also good but price wise it was a bit costly. Hygiene, service and presentation was very good."
4,"Great spot for meat lovers, though the space is a bit cozy. Be careful of your head when sitting upstairs. We tried the smoked duck, buffalo steak, pork belly French fries, and a sandwich ‚Äî definitely a lot of food to fill us up! The green apple drink was amazing, definitely a must-try. It's a perfect place for dates or meeting up with someone for the first time. Worth a visit!"
2,"We were exploring different joints for meat experience. We came across this joint with a decent review. But it was the worst experience at the present time.
The place is congested and too cramped for enjoying and having a good meal. The person taking orders was really annoying and rude in both perspectives, not a person we would like to come across at a restaurant.
The food was really pathetic as it felt like paying a premium for Frozen food.
The Turkey, Duck, Chicken had the same sauce and the quantity was really challenging for a good eater. The food was over cooked and too stiff and chewy.
Pull Pork burger was the only thing which had good taste but zero for its innovation. Plain pull Pork with one lettuce leaf in a plain bun.
The app was really good for placing orders.

The place might have been a good joint, but recently the experience has been a great disappointment.

The food looks great in the photo but the taste and value for money and efforts to go to the restaurant is really not worth it."
5,"Love the ambiance and the food both. An amazing place for meat lovers.

Fresh food - Quick service - Absolutely delicious - Reasonable price
Definitely a favourite spot!"
5,"The OG place when it comes to getting your meat fixation sorted.

Rare to have a place that does high end quality meats at an affordable pricing.

Their cuts of steak, schnitzel, sausages, ribs and wings have legions of followers.

Burgers are at best clumsy, but available. More exotic meats like Duck and Rabbit also make an appearance.

Indoor seating is truly cramped. Service is homely but attentive."
5,"This is my go to place when I crave meat, tried the German hot wings and totally in love with it, the meat just slides off the bone 5/5. Best paired with ginger ale
Cheese bacon fries 3/5
Chicken Cordon Bleu 4/5, deep fried- cheese wrapped with salami."
5,BEST BEST BEST resturant ever ! I literally come all the way from my country to have this food! They always have the fresh peices good quantity for the price ! Very reasonable and the fish is always fresh!!! I love eating here with my family and the staff are super sweet humble and nice !!!
5,"Good Non Vegetarian Restaurant offering excellent maharashtrian specially malvani and karwar style non veg food dishes. Limited dishes in menu card but superb taste.
Good ambience and spacious dining area."
5,"Great seafood place situated right outside Khar station. The thalis here do not disappoint.
My personal favorites are the surmai and bombil thali.
They have valet parking too."
5,"Very good value for money place to eat seafood. Portions are small but enough to feed you and the staff is very polite and courteous.
Service is very prompt too."
4,"Another maharastrian seafood joint which is rite outside Khar station.
We ordered a mix of different seafood thalis which were good. However the fish felt a little  stale since it is off-season now. So could be frozen.
Great value for money though."
5,"The Food is Awesome and the price is easy on the pocket, they have been consistent with taste, quantity and Quality over the last 20 plus years which is commendable. I trust them and their home delivery is so quick. They serve the Best Chinese in Bandra.
Keep up the Good Work üëç"
1,It was a very bad experience we ordered one and half kg of chicken Lahori We ate 1 kg the chicken was good but the other half kg the chicken was totally smelled I ordered from Mr Shantanu who took my order. I explained everything to him. And he is telling me because of the plastic container the chicken spoils. I don't know why they are giving food in a plastic container when it is going to spoil. Very bad service very very bad.
1,"I ordered chicken chilly dry first of all it was a bit expensive, quantity was awesome but taste was pathetic will never try chinese again at this place. I had even taken away chicken tikka biryani the same day, the taste of biryani was also very pathetic without any taste and that too was priced bit high though the portion was good enough for 2 people. I have decided not to opt Joseph's for any food there was other good places to explore good tasty food."
5,"It's good value for money,the portions are huge and tasty. I love the chicken spring rolls and lollipops..superb sauces and rice too..the burnt chilly garlic rice and dragon chicken is a nice spicy combo..will work on your taste buds..remember every dish you buy suffices for two of you."
5,"Very good food, found the staff very polite and helpful. Prices very reasonable, and plenty of vegetarian choices. Would strongly recommend their paneer tikka (starter).

Its a delivery and take away only place (too bad they dont have dine in option)...

My first choice for calling Indian Tandoori food...."
5,Nice place..must try Special Thali..@ 120/-
5,"I had the pleasure of dining at Punjab Sharma Veg Restaurant recently, and I must say, the experience was delightful. We opted for a simple meal of dal and rice, and it exceeded our expectations in terms of flavor and quality. The dal was cooked to perfection, rich in spices and aroma, while the rice was fluffy and accompanied the dal perfectly.

One of the standout aspects of this restaurant is its affordability. Despite offering such delicious fare, the prices are quite reasonable, making it an excellent choice for those looking for great food without breaking the bank. This makes Punjab Sharma Veg Restaurant a fantastic option for enjoying a satisfying daily thali.

What caught my attention even further was their impeccable service. The staff was attentive, courteous, and prompt, ensuring that our dining experience was smooth and enjoyable. The ambiance of the restaurant was cozy and inviting, adding to the overall pleasant atmosphere.

But the surprises didn't end there. We couldn't resist trying the motichoor laddoos, and they were truly a delightful treat. The motichoor laddoos were expertly prepared and had a melt-in-your-mouth texture. It was a sweet ending to our meal and left us thoroughly impressed.

In conclusion, Punjab Sharma Veg Restaurant is a hidden gem for those seeking authentic vegetarian flavors. The dal and rice we tried were a testament to the chef's skill, and the reasonable pricing makes it accessible to a wide range of diners. The addition of the exquisite motichoor laddoos to their menu only adds to the charm of the place. I would highly recommend a visit to Punjab Sharma Veg Restaurant for a memorable dining experience that won't disappoint."
5,Even it's a very old place. Their veg food taste is excellent. Very economical.
2,Used to like their poori aloo a lot.  Went there today after 10 years expecting good taste.  But was very disappointed.
1,Worst for food delivery through Zomato. They accepted the order but did not prepare
3,"Not A Fan Of Monginis Cake But My Mom Loves Monginis Since Many Year's!

The essence & purity of cake is missing as compared to the time they were selling the yummiest cakes few years ago!

On Weekends I Was Here To Buy Cake slices & Pastries!

Few months ago this shop was renovating & it's completely renovated also quite happy with the service, it's a small shop yet it's classy!

Also They Have Come Up With New Varieties Of Cakes!

Devil's Delight Is My Elder Sisters All Time Favourite No Matter What & Vanilla Cake Slice Is My Mother's All Time Favourite!"
3,"A small outlet located in Khar Market Near Khar Station.
.
This Cake shop is the most liked one in Khar as there are not much options available near this locality.
.
Coming to the quality of food items and cakes we will rate it 3/5.
Seating is not available so you have to either stand and eat or take parcel.
.
We found the Cake sponge a little hard and less cream in the pastries
.
They have more options like Pastries,Puff,Mini Pizzas,Donuts Etc.
We loved the Chicken puff
.
They service is kind off slow .The Sales Girl was busy arguing with the Sales boy all the time we stood there which was unprofessional.
.
This review is only for this outlet .Trust me Monginis is one of the renowned cake shops out there and all our Childhood Birthday cakes were bought from here for many years.
.
That's all for Monginis Khar.If You love our Reviews Please follow CHIGO on Facebook,Instagram and Youtube.

Lots of Love,

1,I got the cake from monginis i asked her about chocolate n its fresh cake or not she said its fresh but seriouly it was not good at all felt so embresing in front of my team they thought mi a lesson not to trust on people when its releted to cake n i hope no one get cake from any of monginis shop  i have shared the pic of cake
5,One of the best pastries I ever had thanks for your services and good and cost friendly valentines gift suggestions ‚Ä¶.
1,staff is very rude.. pastry's are not fresh. it was very hard  & dry. never ever order from monginis shop. when i called them for a complaint about pastry they asking me to write a letter for comny. useless staff.
5,"Lassi te parronthhe is a hidden task food place. Here u get typical north ke parranthe, rajama chawl, chaas, kulad Wali dahi, n the parathas here are nicely baked in butter and ghee. U will feel ur in Punjab. All the parathas are served with mirch ka achar and amm ka achar. Dhai is must have on paratha. The person who is the owner only cooks and serves with his huge smile and overwhelming gratitude. He is always very humble even when he is very busy servitude baking parathas for others. Very hard worker. The taste is like whenever ur on Carter road u must try the parathas. Meal for 2 may cost around Rs. 200-300.  Superb place."
4,"A perfect place to have typical Punjabi Parathe and Lassi in the town.
It is a street side stall, due to having painting and ambiance it looks like a typical Punjabi stall and so as the taste.
We found it a little cheap in price, as 2 Paratha and Lassi are enough for 3 people and might cost around 500.
Situated around all the stalls near Carter Road, it is a good place to have Parathe with Punjabi vibes."
3,Since few days it has shifted from it's earlier place.It is just beside wow popcorn shop inside the lane. Their parathas are good to taste. Thier koki and mint Chass is a must try. Though prices are high it can be a must try . They have varieties of parotha which are been served with curd and acchar that too in very Desi style.
5,"This is definitely a hidden gem! Innovation at max: amazing stuffed parrontthe you would just love the feel the taste the yumminess. And then a unique Gud ki lassi, this was revolutionary:)"
4,This is an awesome food experience. Make sure to try the lassi which comes in a clay cup and is made with jaggery. Also I thought the garlic paratha could use more garlic but otherwise it's crispy and soft and oily and delicious!
4,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Swagat Pure Veg, and I must say it was a decent experience with some standout highlights. The restaurant offers a variety of vegetarian dishes, and I was particularly impressed with their Paav Bhaji and juices.

The quality of their Paav Bhaji is outstanding. It's flavorful, well-spiced, and truly a treat for the taste buds. The combination of soft bread rolls and the rich, savory bhaji is a match made in culinary heaven. I've been searching for great Paav Bhaji for a while, and Swagat Pure Veg didn't disappoint.

What truly sets this place apart, though, is the exceptional humility and friendliness of the owner and staff. They go out of their way to ensure you have a pleasant dining experience. Their warm and welcoming demeanor makes you feel right at home.

While the food and service are certainly highlights, I did find the decor a bit flashy, which might not align with the overall tone of the restaurant. However, it's a minor aspect when compared to the delightful food experience.

In summary, Swagat Pure Veg is a place I would recommend for those looking for quality vegetarian food, especially the Paav Bhaji. The friendly staff and great food make it a standout in the neighborhood, and I'm glad I found a place with such delicious Paav Bhaji after a long time."
4,"A pure veg restaurant.
Hygiene is well maintained
Reasonably priced.
New look with a totally different interior.
Well located.
Pav bhaji, dosas, sandwiches, chole bhature, juice, icecream.... what else.... good to enjoy..."
2,"Wouldn‚Äôt recommend this restraunt, found out nothing was available other than pav bhaji and tawa pulao. The portion wasn‚Äôt great aswell. Would recommend crossing the road and visit Guru Kripa for better food at half the cost."
5,"Small cute place, very yummy fresh veg food and snacks. Reasonable prices. Friendly staff."
5,Simple Vegetarian Restaurant. Average but Quick Service. Humble Manager. Good for Quick Snacks and Tea/Coffee.
4,"Good place to relax and enjoy the view.
Location of this cafe is amazing.
they have indoor seating with 4-5 tables.
Had Latte, cappucino and muffin
coffee's and muffin are ok.
prices are on higher side.
Nice ambience with quick service."
5,"After the sun was out, I went on to sit by the Barista for a cold cuppa coffee, and I have been visiting this place during all my visits to Bandstand earlier, from 2002 actually.¬† Right beside it there used to be a Cafe Coffee Day, which is not closed and that space is also taken by Barista.¬† Imagine two of the biggest coffee chains, tough competitors just next to each other, sharing a wall and customers, it was as iconic as the cola wars.¬† As I went inside the air conditioned space of Barista, to place my order of a cold Brrrista Frappe for the hot morning, the order was taken swiftly and my drink handed over to me quickly for me relish overlooking the sea, amongst some nosy crows, friendly canines and their owners, this place is not just recommended for the fantastic coffee brews, but also for being bang on bandstand and the views it offers, even now, though constricted with all the construction around."
4,"If you need a nice feel of open air, sea, breeze and classy people, then this is the perfect place.

Whether you're meeting your lover or just chilling with your regular cronies, there's a different buzz which will make you feel just great."
5,Good place for hang out. Basic caffee laate recomended. Opened till lare night
3,"The location of the cafe is extremely good. We ordered and Irish cappuccino to go, but  it didn't dht turn out like expected. Would like to try more things but yeah not sure how it will be."
3,My friend asked to turn on the AC so the guy there asked us to shift to another table. That was weird but as you can see the pictures what i ordered was 'Crushed pepper chicken rice' it looked amazing and the food was tasty. This place is good if you want to click pictures of your food they have a very unique style of representation.. The food is costly as this rice costed me for 280 bucks and the quantity is very less like just for a person. The food was good but the service wasn't. And they have only 8 tables to sit so plan and go there.
2,"I had visited this place on Wednesday. It's next to The Bar Stock Exchange, Linking Road. I wanted to have something light and something which is easy on pockets too, so I selected this place. Small place. Ideal for 2-4 people. I ordered Cheese Garlic Bread, Mexican Quesadilla and Envy drink. Food was average. Service was very poor. My friend was checking the Menu card and the waiter just took away the card without asking. After ordering, we were straight away given a bill without a say. Very rude and disappointing service. If in a rush, only then try this place."
4,"I visited flavours on a weekend. It wasnt overcrowded , and the food  was pretty good . The cold coffee with vanilla ice cream is definitely worth a shot and the  Mexican grill sandwich was yum! Definitely worth a try . Not a very expensive place and the staff is friendly too!"
5,Food is fresh and staff are sweet. Try mandarin chicken. It's very soft and good
2,Pizza didn't have any taste. Plus it's expensive.
5,"There's food which comforts and food that helps you escape by triggering the taste buds of memory or location. Very rarely do you get to experience food that does both.
'Cheron' have kept a small yet bright flicker of Parsi food alive amidst a whole bunch of new agey franchisee places.
The chutney is the stuff of legend. It's what makes every amazing Patra ni Machhi you have tried a food of the gods. And if you haven't tried this chutney in its other avatars in a patty or as a sandwich you have denied yourself a pleasured palate.
I'm a big kebabs and appetizer meats guy, so immediately took a liking to the delicately spiced chicken cheese balls and the smokey melt-in-your-mouth tikkas.
The chicken mince balls were a big sense and slightly spicidr so i suggest have them piping hit as juices might dry up of you pack then too long.
The kheema patty's/chops are mini meals in themselves so less is more is a great idea.
Overall though for the price and the taste alone make them a regular snacking option if not a complete Sunday meal with the family.
Go ahead prepare to escape in food heaven."
4,"We love Parsi food and when we get it delivered at home, we love it more. I ordered a dhansak which was very well balanced dish and came with brown rice and salad. Brown rice was perfect and long. The dhansak was flavourful. I also ordered the Chicken Farcha which was a bit oily but it was yummy. The Lagan nu Custard was delivered frozen cold maintaining it's texture and temperature and tasted the best out of all the dishes. Also tried their chicken croissantü•ê which was soft and the filling was pretty decent.
Must try for Parsi food Lovers. Homely feeling in the taste"
4,"Location:-
Cheron is located at the Hill road next to St. Peter's Church. Must visit place if you like surprised when you tasty new food because it has so many delicious and tasty items which will give you for sure surprise.

Must try food items:-
Chicken Puffs,
Malai tikka croissants
Chicken Reshmi Kabab Rolls
Grilled Chicken Burger

Must try desserts:-
Lagan nu custard
Chocolate Crunch Pudding

Cheron has so many variety of food items that you'll definitely get confused when you'll visit it first time, but that's the point -- visit it first time then it will make you visit again and again to taste every item of their menu. All the best for your wallet.

It's is place where you'll get Quantity as well as Quality."
5,"Great service, and excellent food! Leaves you wanting more and more."
1,Pathetic food. Got food poisoned.
5,"It was hot that day. I walked for kilometres around the city before stumbling upon this fine establishment. The dosa, a delight to the senses. The smell, the taste, the feeling of the crunchy texture between my fingers. Pure delight!"
1,"I ordered the quattro pizza, and much to my disappointment it had no taste, it looked so bad that i couldn‚Äôt even take a picture. There‚Äôs no concept of pizza sauce with terrible base unbaked. Benne dosa was below average to the least edible. While eating i felt like my taste buds had stopped working. Could only taste the coconut in the chutney."
4,"One of the best restaurants to have vegetarian food in Bandra. We were a foodie group and we ordered a mix of dishes ranging from Dosa to Dinner consisting of Veg Crispy, Paneer Tikka Masala starters, Veg Handi, Paneer Lababdar, rotis and Dal Khichadi. The food was delicious and totally value for money. The manager and staff were very courteous. Overall an amazing experience üëç

5,"Recently visited to this outlet and tried their mouthwatering dishes.
In Mocktail we tried a virgin mojito which was too good in taste in starters we tried a pizza and veg crispy which was fresh and well cooked as well as tasty.
Paneer mutter and butter naan was too good in taste as well as quality and quantity was good enough.

Service was good and staff was too friendly, ambience was just amazing.

Overall, the experience was good with this place..!"
5,"Shree Sagar is a fine restaurant with good ambience and great food. In starters, Paneer Yekki Tekki is a must try along with the subz seekh kebab which has a really great quantity and tastes absolutely delicious. In mocktails, there are great options but All Time Mojito with a flavour of Kala Khatta is so refreshing and worth having another of it. The sizzlers are absolutely superb and it will take more than 2 people to finish it off. Definitely have veg pattie + mexican rice + oriental sauce as a combination. Lastly, if you are full from mind-blowing food and your appetite is at its peak, their kulfi is the last thing you need to finish off a great dinner. The staff was great and the service was very quick. A nice place to visit with your family!"

Food was awesome.

Worth trying."
3,"My first visit. The interiors is unique. The posters on the wall. The hygiene all is super. The crowd is good. The waiters are cooperative. But the quality of the food is really very poor. My list of orders- 2 chicken soup - taste ohkay. One plate chicken lollipop- stinking one. We had to return. Next comes the main dishes chicken handi - superb taste but chicken bhuna taste was zero. They used the  same stale chicken. We returned it.
They didn't charged us the money for the food but I hope they improve the quality of food and before making any dish they check the quality of chicken."
5,"Food is Delicious
Great service
Best part is open till 5 am
Parking available"
5,One of the best places in Mumbai  to satiate your midnight food cravings! Their rolls and caramel pudding  are a must try!
5,"The only reason to give it a 5 star is because it is open till wee hours, when every other place is shut, you can come here with friends and have a good meal. not like limited food, but a complete meal. Because it does good for humanity especially for people who party till late in the night and then after getting intoxicated and all the dance moves when they feel hungry and tired, all the restaurants are shut, this restaurant comes out like a savior, Knight in shining Armour and serves you."
1,"Extremely disappointed. Placed a party order for 70 guests and would never recommend this place. They are very laxed and seem to be disinterested in doing business at each stage, they just don't care. Firstly, getting time to discuss was such a task, no callbacks and no response to messages. The final order that was decided was to be confirmed by them in writing but never happened. They don't deliver so you need to leave your party and come to collect the order. Food was packed in a shabby way resulting in spillage in the car. They couldn't find the lid so send a container full of cheese sauce without a proper cover. One of the items was not prepared at all, they just casually missed it! Cheese sauce was watery and subpar. Had to follow up multiple times to get an invoice and in the end the invoice had errors despite sharing the details. Save yourself and don't deal with these ppl."
1,Taking tomuch time to prepare food very bad service
1,The original cafe has closed and the new kitchen is now next to candies. There is no dinning area and one would be better off just ordering. Wouldn't recommend
5,"Such a value for money eating option in Pali, love their sandwiches, samosas, chicken tandoori."
1,Rude staff .....home delivery service not up to the mark and no consistency in taste of snacks .
5,"I've ordered from this place so many times, even after being in Bandra this hotel serve food at an affordable price. From India to Chinese they have a wide range of dishes available and it taste's just yummy.. Specially try their choley masala it is out of this world I'm not a huge fan of vegetarian food but their choley masala has my heart.. Highly recommended for take away."
1,I call for an order first I order 1 paneer biryani n chicken biryani but I said him plz send only paneer biryani now n in the evening send Chicken biryani bcoz of my fast but that guy don't know how to talk with the clients we R paying him he is not giving me D free biryani he is vry rude I hate the way he talk with me vry disappointed I'll not recommend to anyone to order from there .
1,The staff is very  irritating nonsense he don't no how to talk  with women's
1,Today I ordered a paneer biryani and the quantity of biryani was so less n even the rice was didn't cook properly I was so disappointed coz I have given 150 for it n I called to do complain about it so the guy was like I dont know about olll dis if u don't know about it u should have go n check in the kitchen if the cooking people r giving the right quantity or know I must say if the owner only is not looking after for oll dis issue den nothing if gonna happen m not gonna order anything from now Zero percent customer service
5,"The staffs were very humble and polite the order takes some time but is delicious it is located nearby mini punjab
They serve food expensive the taste is also not good that much however apsara isa good and family friendly and affordable restaurant in bandra"
4,"Awesome place to party with good food and drinks!!! We visited during Chritmas and there was waiting for approx 20minutes which was fine!
We ordered veg burger slider which came along with onion rings and a dip. The taste was delicious and something I can have again at Irish house!! Cockatis were good too.
A bit on the expensive side but the vibe was really amazing and something you must experience as well‚ù§Ô∏è"
5,"Top Irish style pub. Whilst it doesn't actually sell anything Irish, the excellent menu, drinks selection (3 types of Kingfisher draught alone), and great atmosphere more than makes uo for that! Highly recommended."
3,"The ambience was good. Drinks were not as expected. Half of the things we ordered from the menu were not available so we were disappointed. We also spotted a rat running near the ceiling of the bar so. .....
Besides the ambience was the only thing that was good."
4,The hamburger were good and beer very cold. Service were good.
4,"Great place for pastas, coffee, platters and drinks."
4,"Gave 4 stars because the food we ordered was solid, about 4/5, though it lacked that wow factor. Everything else about this place is fantastic.

The cocktails are easily some of the best in town‚Äîstrong and packed with flavor. The ambiance is amazing, making it an ideal spot to catch up with old friends or enjoy a meal with family, though it might not be the best choice for a date.

The staff is friendly and helpful, especially when it comes to recommending dishes. While the food is a bit on the pricey side, the drinks and ambiance definitely make it worth the cost."
4,"We had lovely dinner at Pali Bhavan, the fish starter (can‚Äôt remember the name) was so tender and delicious, best dish I had in Mumbai!

Love the deco of the restaurant, staff were friendly, highly recommend, will probably sit downstairs next time, the AC upstairs is a little bit fierce though :)."
5,"This is what a great restaurant should be like. Amazing vegetarian options beyond paneer. Great service, amazing food. Classy place so bit expensive. Perfect for special occasions. This place been around almost 12 years and is a famous Bandra legend."
5,"Pali Bhavan is definitely one of the finest restaurants in Mumbai offering amazing North Indian food.

Their Tandoori Broccoli is out of this world and a must have! If you‚Äôre in a bigger group, also try the Tandoori Shakarkhand (sweet potato). For the mains, I would recommended the Panner Khatta Pyaaz and Dal Makhani. Food overall is outstanding.

Service might seem a bit slow especially on busy days but trust me, the wait just makes the food taste even better!"
5,"My wife and I went here on our first night in Mumbai. And WOW we were blown away! The astonishing interior takes you back a 100 year meanwhile the menu clearly shows that this is not dated!

We had the best butter chicken I have ever tried! And I‚Äôve had my share ü´É the coconut chicken was a bliss as well!

We also tried the Chaat and it was crazy! All fresh mango chutney with crispies. Really good.

Get a drink meanwhile you‚Äôre here!"
5,"Bandra is chock-full of places to eat and I'm so pleased I chose Punjab Sweet House - sit down restaurant upstairs and snacks plus mithai counters on the ground floor.

Their sublime choley bhature was served with a side of the most excellent tangy mixed savoury pickle and sweet mango pickle.  And just when I thought I couldn't fit in anything more, a couple of garam garam jalebis completed a most satisfying meal.

As I was leaving, I saw the queue for the live chaat counter...next time."
1,"Gave stale Motichoor laddoo even after asking the counter boy if it's fresh or not,they are lying saying it's fresh and packing stale laddoos, didn't expect from them after paying a costing amount."
5,"We had so much fun here! We really enjoyed trying some chaats (dahi kachori, pani puri and aloo chaat). They were all delicious. We also had their creamy and delicious ras malai. Their sweets are also tasty and it is where I developed my love for besan ladoo. YUM!"
1,Visited the place on Sunday. I ordered a regular veg thali. Pricing is bit too high but the thing that disappointed me was the quantity. They served only two small chapati and the rice in a small bowl. I mean you can literally count the pieces of rice they served. Overall  experience was very disappointing.
5,"Best chaat i have had in Mumbai, comparable to Delhi. Tikki chat and bhalla papdi were awesome. There is a seating option on first floor but Congress with a premium. The prices on ground floor with no seating are cheaper. There are good sweets and bakery options also on ground floor. First floor serves starters, chaat and main course"
5,"I am pretty sure, you would not have tried something as good as their crispy chicken roll in the roll category.
Tandoori chicken was good too, overall every food item is great.
Their delivery and service is very slow, on the phone I was told 30 mins, I got my order after an hour

Be careful when you order chilli chicken ‚Äì it‚Äôs way too spicy compared to other versions, and the chili is extremely hot üå∂Ô∏èüî•.

You can check the chiklies I got in one roll ‚Äì there were more, and I had already eaten a few before collecting them. üòÖ"
1,"Avoid this restaurant as they are reportedly serving chicken that is 5 to 6 days old. Consuming such food poses serious health risks. Remember, health is wealth ‚Äî if you‚Äôre paying for food, it should be fresh and safe.please don‚Äôt buy any food from this restaurant."
5,Apparently it‚Äôs quite difficult to get real good tandoori chicken in the southern states so definitely check this restaurant out. It‚Äôs a tiny place but with authentic tandoor dishes. The garlic kabab was great. But tandoori was out of this world. Perfectly spices marinated smoky charred from the tandoor and super tender and juicy! 10/10 for the chicken tandoori. Garlic cheese naan was delicious and the chicken seek kabab was juicy and tender. Fresh coriander chutney and delicious salty buttermilk/lassi. It‚Äôs also a plus they carry ThumbsUp! The chicken handi was good but not authentic it was sweeter and not as creamy or smoky as the real one. Service was great and seating was nice on the second floor. Great place and a must visit for tandoori.
1,i jus found a bug in the hakka noodles while eating .... i feel sick and disgusted .... so cheap ... never ordering from here ever again
3,Food taste is not so good like u cant even eat what's on your plate weird taste
3,"The taste of the cheesecake was quite average, with a musty cheese flavors dominating rather than the rich, creamy texture expected from a traditional cheesecake. üòï

On the bright side, the caf√©‚Äôs ambience was truly amazing. ‚ú® They offer a wide variety of cheesecake flavors, which is tempting. üç∞ I‚Äôve tried a few, and while they were good, none stood out enough to make it to my favorites list."
4,Felt so christmassy here ..such cute little place and the food is finger licking good..They have a spl strawberry menu.Had a Aragula strawberry and chicken salad which was so delicious but it had more of lettuce  then Aragula.Creps was perfect with loads of strawberries and mascarpone cheese..‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
3,"The cheesecake was average in taste. It leaned more towards a musty cheese flavor rather than the creamy texture one might expect from a traditional cheesecake. This aspect could be improved to enhance the overall dessert experience. On a positive note, the ambience of the cafe was truly amazing. The atmosphere was inviting and pleasant, making it a great place to relax and enjoy."

5,"The vibes and the food was sooo nice
The decor was aesthetic and the pancakes and hot choco i had were very tasty
Wanna go again"
5,"Amanzi situated in the heart of Bandra is an amazing pool side sky-deck Restaurant. Artistic, cute ambiance with a  serene vibe.
They have comfortable indoor seating and nice  outdoor seating near pool side. The staff was quite helpful for us.
We tried few things and I Must say food was fabulous. Cocktails were refreshing we tried our hands on Thai coconut super fresh drink , Achari Margarita which had a sour punch and spicy taste to it.
Nachos were crispy served with cheese sauce, salsa and Guacamole.
Dessert was fabulous we tried Pull me up. Overall we had a good experience."
5,"Visited this beautiful place yesterday for lunch and it was a splendid experience. The place has chic decor all over and the all over interiors have been put up really well. This place also has poolside dining which is the biggest attraction I'll say. The bar is decently big and they have almost all the booze you could ask for.
Talking about the f&b , it's superb. The menu is curated really well having mix and match of Indian and continental cuisine. To start off ,
In drinks we had mandarin virgin mojito which was super refreshing and had perfect sweetness. Went really well with our appetizers.
We also tried thai litchi which was the mix of litchi and lemongrass topped with sparkling water giving it smooth flavor. Both the mocktails were well presented too which is a nice thing.

In appetizers we had 3 way fried chicken basked which had 3 types of chicken (wings, popcorn , drumstick/nuggets) which was crumb fried and had crisp coated texture from outside and juicy texture from inside. It's highly recommend as it will satisfy your deep fried chicken cravings to the fullest. It can go great with your drinks too. Alongside they also serve garlic mayonnaise , barbeque sauce and honey chilli sauce. Also had malai chicken tikka which was presented very nicely and it was a total eye catcher with the hanging skewer. Tender tikkas well marinated in malai preparation served with mint dip was just yumm!

In mains we had chicken tikka masala which is served with paratha or rice, we opted for paratha and the whole dish was something to drool on to. The chef had done incredible job in making this one for sure as the spice was perfectly balanced and had great taste and texture.
We also had Lebanese chicken pizza which comes with potato fries alongside. Had that authentic flavor of Italian thin crust pizzas but with a twist of Lebanese chicken topping which was scrumptious. Would recommend trying with their garlic mayonnaise as it is fabulous.

To sum up our delicious meal we had to order a dessert to satisfy the sweet tooth and this place had my favorite dessert of all the time. Lotus biscoff cheesecake was the call and it was totally sinful. Soft , creamy cheesecake having lotus biscoff flavor to it nothing more you could have ask for.

Big ups to the management too Manager sameer and captain Cyril coelho made sure we get the best hospitality delivered and made our dining experience even more better. Comprising the factors of great food spread and amazing decor and poolside theme this place is an ideal choice for dinner if you are in bandra hill road."
5,"Amanzi is an amazing lounge that offers both indoor and outdoor sitting. The outdoor sitting is beautiful with a bar & poolside dining. They have cooling fans all over and it's quite comfortable to sit outdoor for lunch as well.

Coming to the food and drinks -

We trued Mixed berry Mojito, served in an amazing old fashioned wooden glass and topped with berries. It was refreshing with the perfect taste.

Avocado on sourdough - creamy, great bread, topped with cherry tomatoes, feta and drizzled with Balsamic.

Truffle Hummus Falafel - imthis was my favourite from the appetizers. The presentation looked amazing and everything tasted perfect.

Classic Margherita Pizza- the lunch favourite pizza was perfectly cheesy and was also available in Jain. It definitely goes well with the vibe of Amanzi.

Penne in pesto cream with toasted nuts. The quantity was great for 2 people and was served with 2 long pieces of garlic bread. It was creamy as required with exotic veggies.

Overall i loved everything amout this place, with the open air dining to the service to candlelight dinner option. This rooftop place must definitely be on your list next"
5,"Amanzi is one of the most stylish restaurant in bandra, Mumbai. The restaurant comes with beautiful outdoor Seatings and very beautiful outdoor bar. Also there is swimming available in the restaurant and also you can enjoy your drinks and food with the live screening.

We recently visited this restaurant with the office colleagues. We had couple of drinks with food and our overall experience was good.

‚ú®In Drinks we had Tropical Breezeüç∑ and Deep Diveüçπ. Both the cocktail and mocktail was good in taste, very well made.

‚ú® In starters, we had ordered Chicken spicy bao and Crispy chicken with beans sauce. Good in taste and presentation as well.

‚ú®In Mains we had, Chicken Tikka with rice and mix sauce pasta üçù. Pasta was very tasty. Also chicken tikka was good.

‚ú®In Dessert we had, Pull me up chocolate cake. It was very sweet and yummy. Also amazing in presentation.

Overall very amazing restaurant to visit with friends and enjoy time.

#HappyDiningüåà"
5,"Amanzi Skydeck and Bar located at Hill Road, Bandra is a place I would definitely love to visit again. What I loved is that they served dual-ambience. One where you can relax and eat with your family, and the other one which is poolside where you can chill and drink with your friends. Both were beautiful and comfortable.
The food here was better than I expected. A lot better.
We started the dinner with some starters, we first ordered BBQ Chicken Wings, tender and delicious wings tossed Barbeque sauce is my usual favorite however the control over the spice is what I loved over here. Took me 5 minutes to make these wings disappear. I obviously have to mention the Cheese Garlic Bloom Bread which was our 2nd starter. I am still drooling over it. Cheese and Garlic is one of the best combinations and this was indeed Cheesy inside and Garlic-y at the same time. Managing the taste well.
We moved to the main course with Lebanese Chicken Pizza. Thin crust is definitely one of my favorites. And this was not disappointing at all, crispy chicken pizza served with fries a lot better than I expected. Although a little more chicken on Pizza wouldn't hurt. :P
And we finally finished our meal with one of the best desserts I've had till date, LOTUS BISCOFF CHEESECAKE! This is one of the reasons I am coming back here. MOST RECOMMENDED. If you love cheesecake, you have to love this one. I wish I could eat 4-5 more of these but I was already full.
All in all, one of the best places either to party or relax or both
The service is on par and the staff was knowledgeable.
I would definitely suggest this one if you're in or around Bandra."
3,Little shaddy and average food. Not gonna visit again.
5,
4,
4,Good ambience clubbed with good food but over priced on the whole.
5,"A lovely place to make for a perfect evening. One can order a cup of coffee and the delicious pizza that they prepare and have a good time whilst losing track of the same. Not too heavy on the pocket, and the washrooms are just lovely. A visit inside can rejuvenate you!"
4,"Grabbed a quick lunch here a week ago and was quite pleased with what they had to offer.  The menu is largely italian and continental but even so, they get some dishes way off target while some are delicious.  Tip for french fry junkies, do try out their fries as they're quite something!  Overall, it's worth trying out if you're looking for some continental in a not too expensive place in Bandra."
1,"Absolutely shocking food. Every thing is cheesy.  All pastas we ordered tasted like mac n cheese. Tasted like Italian food served in India 20 years ago.
They don't serve any alcohol either. Please send your chef to Italy for a month....they only thing decent was the basic garlic bread and pita and hummus dip."
4,The place is aesthetically pleasing with an elegant interior and a beautiful outdoor seating area. Can be a good choice for those seeking to eat a quiet meal surrounded by helpful staff members and good food.
5,"This is one of the best-buffet-places-you-should-visit-before-you-die kinda place. The ambience of this place is really noticeable and commendable. The setup and the interiors are pretty good. Now let's come to food. Every piece of food that you get here is delicious. Going from starters to their desserts, all of them are delicious and have great facilities flavours in them. Their buffet is supposed to be one of the best in town. Prawns and Chicken Kebabs are the best here. You may even try the A-la-Carte. Service here is pretty fast. You may have to wait for a while during lunch hours."
5,"Right in the heart of Bandra, Caravan Serai is a perfect combination of decor, theme, ambiance, service, quality & taste of food. Contemporary seating & decor, food is north Indian in both veg & non veg varieties. A great part is the hygiene levels of the place & the service staff as well who are neatly shaved & dressed in authentic Indian wear. Valet Parking available & they accept all kinds of cards. Post meal, if insisted by guest, they give some complimentary sweets & paan."
5,"One of the best place to have buffets, spectacular interiors, Greece type of structure and ambience! Amazing food ! Good staff! Northwestern type of cuisines you get ! Must Visit place with friends and family, I liked the place and food a lot !"
3,"Caravan Serai is mostly known for it's lunch buffet. It was a hit and miss affair from our perspective today with some excellent starters and other very ordinary dishes. The mains were a bit better but nothing special. There was quite a spread and plenty to choose from but there was nothing really captivating on offer. They do have some good desserts, the chocolate pudding (some folks call it a mousse but it's far to dense for a mousse) was good. They sometimes have schemes like a person eats free for a group over 5 people so that's good especially for office parties. Staff is prompt and quite courteous too."
5,"This is one of my favorite Indian restaurants in Mumbai. Cuisine is more Northwest Frontier types, lika Pakhtooni. Food is out of the world. Dal Bukhara, Subzi Punjabi and Dum Biryani must try. Prices quite reasonable.
Ambience and overall cleanliness also excellent, very typical, low seats, copper drinking glasses and all.
They have lunch buffets, again priced quaite reasonably, with vast variety of tandoori starters as well as deserts."
1,"I‚Äôve had the most pathetic meal of my life today, this place had barely any staff at the counter to assist. The food was so bad my friends and I got food poisoning instantly. The store was so dirty and unhygienic. Our money got wasted and everything was just so bad. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend anyone going here. If there was an option for minus rating that would be apt for our meal here."
1,"Absolutely the worst McDonald‚Äôs experience I‚Äôve ever had. Visited the Hill Road, Bandra West outlet today and was shocked ‚Äî the place was a complete mess. Nearly 80% of the tables were covered in garbage and no staff bothered to clean up ac not working . Still, I made the mistake of ordering food. My bill was around ‚Çπ2,000 and it took over 20 minutes to arrive ‚Äî the food was spoiled, burnt, and completely inedible. I ended up with stomach pain and vomiting, likely due to food poisoning. Deeply disappointed. This outlet urgently needs serious attention from management.

I have a full video for your reference im not able to add it here so im taking ss of the video"
1,Super rude staff across the board. If McDonald's cares about customers they should all be fired. Messed up/Dirty store. Mostly they ask for cash payments giving excuses for UPI server being down and also don't accept card payment. Some fraud for sure. A friend of mine was shouted at by staff for no reason.
5,"A good place to hang out with family and friends.
The atmosphere is good and well maintained.
The staff is polite and helpful.
Gets crowded during peak hours but otherwise you can sit in peace and quiet while you enjoy your meal and work as well.
The only thing is that the machines placed to order don't always work."
1,"I came here in 35 C hot summer and AC wasn't working properly, it was very hot in here, on the top of that their beverage machine was out of order. In this hot summer I hoped to get a cold beverage, since their machine was out of order I got a Coke bottle from outside, and they didn't even let me drink that. Totally disappointing service"
4,"House of Mandarin is a small, cozy restaurant with a pleasant ambiance that makes it feel inviting and intimate. One of the highlights is its bar counter, which truly stands out with a well-crafted selection of drinks. The service was commendable, with staff being attentive and courteous.

Unfortunately, the food did not meet our expectations. We began with a mushroom soup, which was disappointing due to a strong bamboo shoot flavor that overwhelmed the dish. This unexpected twist took away from what should have been a comforting start to the meal.

The seating arrangement felt a bit cramped, detracting from the overall comfort of the experience. Additionally, the cleanliness of the washroom was lacking, which is something the establishment should prioritize"
5,"Lovely Pan Asian Restaurant at Bandra! The Crowd and the Bandra vibe is something we really enjoyed! We had sushis, dimsums, mocktails and Pan Fried Noodles! The taste was amazing and we enjoyed every bit! Saturdays vibes and we were shopping nearby and hopped into this due to hunger pangs! Made our day! Lovely ambience and staff was supportive too! Highly recommended to all! Must try for all food lovers!"
5,"Lovely place, great chinese food. Dumplings are exceptional."
3,"Starting with the ambience, it is quite lovely and extravagant with marble top tables and delicate cutlery. The service was also very nice the staff was attentive and sometimes a bit too enthusiastic. The thing that i was hyped up for was the food which was not that good and honestly i was a bit disappointed. The prawn tempura sushi was a bit too sweet. The claypot chicken was quite salty and the sauce was extremely off balance. My palate couldn‚Äôt have it. The glazed lamb in special sauce was good but it‚Äôs also a bit on the sweeter side. The soy noodles were great, the rice was also very good. Overall a 2.5/5. Would not recommend."
4,"Nice and quick service
Tasty food
Variety of authentic Chinese food.
Loved it more due to on going chinese new year season celebration
Ordered Amber mocktail, chili chicken dim sum and prawns tempura sushi. Loved it. Brownies as complimentary."
5,"Bombay Salad Co. is a hidden gem in Bandra!

Every salad here is a true work of art ‚Äî rich in flavor, generous in portion, and surprisingly affordable. Who knew salads could be this delicious and filling? The ingredients are fresh, the food is super healthy, and the menu offers a massive variety to choose from. The juices and smoothie bowls are absolutely fantastic as well. Whether you‚Äôre a health nut or just craving something light and tasty, this place delivers every time. Highly recommended!"
5,"I recently visited The Bombay Salad Co. with friends and had a fantastic experience! The ambiance was lovely, and the service was top-notch.

The real highlight, however, was the food - deliciously healthy and freshly prepared. The portions were generous, and the flavors were spot on.

Best part? Great value for money! Our bill for two came out to be approximately ‚Çπ1,200.

Overall, I'd highly recommend The Bombay Salad Co. for a healthy, tasty, and satisfying meal out with friends!"
5,"Brilliant Salad restaurant.

They have a mix of salads from various world regions.

The ingredients are fresh, healthy and tasty.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is good.

Recommended‚Ä¶!"
5,Bombay Salad Company is a must visit for salads and it‚Äôs a really wonderful place for health-conscious foodies. Definitely would recommend trying the Protein Overdose and their variety of shakes.
5,"This spot in Bandra, Mumbai, is my go-to for healthy salad and rice bowls, as well as great coffee and smoothies. The portion sizes are generous, and they offer a customizable salad bowl option. one is enough to fill 2 people. With a variety of choices for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians, it‚Äôs a must-try. 10/10 recommended!"
1,"I am writing to share a very disappointing experience I had with my recent order from Meraki.

I had ordered the ‚ÄúDums of Heaven‚Äù (Lollipop Chicken), expecting the quality Meraki is known for. However, what I received was extremely poor ‚Äî there was hardly any chicken inside, just a thick coating of cornflour. It was horrible. We were extremely hungry and had ordered with the expectation of having a good chicken dish, trusting the Meraki brand. Unfortunately, this is the second time I have faced this issue. The last time, I chose not to complain, but it has happened again, which is unacceptable.

Additionally, the delivery service was equally disappointing. The delivery person did not contact me upon arrival. After a long wait, when I checked the app, it showed the food was delivered. Upon checking with my building security, I found out the delivery was made to another building entirely ‚Äî despite the correct address being clearly mentioned.

This experience ‚Äî both with the food quality and the delivery service ‚Äî was completely unacceptable. I genuinely expected better from Meraki, especially considering its reputation.

I request you to take this matter seriously and ensure such incidents do not happen again."
1,"At the start, they used to serve good food, but nowadays, there's not a single time they don't make mistakes. Either it's too salty, or there's barely any meat/chicken provided. The quantity of rice is decent, but what's the point if they don't include enough chicken? They should consider charging more if needed but provide an adequate quantity."
5,This was my first time ordering from Meraki....and I must say they did not dissapoint at all...the food was lovely and the quantity was huge but really amazing food. I had ordered chicken shezwan noodle and chicken lollipop and both of them were delicious. The packaging is good. I ordered it from swiggy...on time delivery. The food was fresh and pipping hot. I had heard a lot good about this place and yes I must say it exceeded my expectations!!!!Loved the food...Now this will be my go to restaurant for chinese. Added it to my favorites. Awesome food.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
1,"Extremely Disappointed ‚Äì Received Stale and Rotten Food

I‚Äôm genuinely shocked by the quality of food I received. Not only was it stale, but  the meal were visibly rotten and had a foul smell. It was completely unfit for consumption and a serious health hazard. I had higher expectations and trusted this platform/restaurant to deliver safe, edible food. This experience was unacceptable, and I urge the team to take immediate action to ensure quality control. No customer should have to go through this."
1,"Disappointing Online Order

I'm extremely dissatisfied with my recent online purchase from zomato. Unfortunately, the product did not meet my expectations.
The overall experience was disappointing, and I wouldn't recommend this product to others. I hope you have to takes steps to improve product quality and accuracy.

Over all disappointed"
5,It‚Äôs a beautiful experience. Everybody can enjoy the Japanese style sushi. They have also delivery service.
4,"Teriyaki chicken was good, for a meat eater. Personally would choose that over the veg options. It's sweet, creamy and satisfying!"
4,Delicious and pocket friendly Sushi. Freshly made with a good menu to choose from. You need to try it.
5,"I love their sushi, very hospitable people serving you as well. The joint is really small, but it's mainly for take away orders. Their idea of a sushi in a burrito-style roll is really a hack that every sushi lover needed. Thumbs for almost everything. My recommendation? The Surimi Roll"
5,"The sushi was incredible, and all of the ingredients used were perfect! When we called, we were given clear options for both vegetarian sushi and non vegetarian sushi. The sushi came with soy sauce in squeeze bottles, so you didn't have to open the whole roll and add the soy sauce. It had a lot of ginger and wasabi on the side, so that you can add the exact amount you want. The delivery was quick, and the sushi was at the perfect temperature. I loved it a LOT! In the future I would like to try some more authentic Japanese styles, because they had a lot of Indian fusion sushis and less authentic Japanese ones"
3,"The hot chocolate is simply yummy ‚òïüç´, but honestly, it's too much for one person. It's so sweet that you definitely need 2 people to finish it. I don't think it's suitable for one person to have it all alone.

Other than that, the San Churros was crispy and good üòã. However, the seating is a big issue‚Äîit‚Äôs small and congested üòï. I really miss the earlier Linking Road outlet, which was spacious and much more comfortable ü™ë.

The mocha coffee was disappointing, and the Spanish latte was downright unpleasant. ‚òïüòñ However, the Alfredo chicken pasta was a delight‚Äîflavorful and delicious, though slightly on the sweeter side. üçùüòã The quantity could have been a bit more generous, but the taste made up for it. Overall, a mixed experience with hits and misses. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
5,Amazing desserts with nice ambience. We had fruit waffle and churros which just were amazing. The fruit waffle was made in a very different style and tasted amazing. Definitely going back again to have it.
4,"All time favorite dessert spot. Love hanging out here for a quick bite, mainly always for the churros :D
Whenever I prefer a light dessert, the kid churros work perfectly.
The chocolate fondue is great too."
5,"Great place to come for all your dessert and chocolate cravings.
They have indoor as well as outdoor seating available here.
The serving quantity is pretty big so you may want to share a dessert between 2 people.
They have good coffee and cold beverage options.
Service is fast.
Parking here can be an issue as there is no dedicated parking. You will have to find your own parking spot on the street which is always full."
3,"Good churros. Bit chewy as it might have been re-heated.
The milk chocolate dip was good."
5,"Amrut Sagar stands out as the premier destination for vegetarian cuisine in Bandra.  This eatery excels in both quality & quantity, ensuring you get your money's worth. The ambiance is delightful & inviting, making it a perfect spot for casual dining or special occasions.You'll enjoy a peaceful environment that complements the delicious dishes.Don't miss out on this fantastic culinary experience that caters exclusively to veg food enthusiasts!"
5,"Best pav bhaji we had, taste is amazing
Quantity for two is great, we had manchurian fried rice it was delicious
Loved taste ‚ù§Ô∏è also fruit salad with ice cream was best‚ù§Ô∏è
Best hotel for veg option in Bandra West."
4,"A decade ago I tasted their Pav Bhaji for the first time and  it became my favourite place for pav bhaji. Recently I had a chance to visit this place again, and even today the taste remains the same. They have one of the best pav bhaji in mumbai.
Good ambience, great service and Delicious food."
5,"Definitely recommend considering their interesting menu consisting of street food/chaat/south Indian/Indian pizzas, sandwiches.

If you're craving for good mumbai food, this place will be a good option.

I came here for a late lunch/snack - was able to park the bike, then get a table without fuss. Pani Puri was served quickly, the special cheese pav bhaji took a bit longer. Overall quick and friendly service, extensive menu with many variations.

Definitely not cheap but I'm guessing if you need to sit down for your meal in Bandra then you better shell out decent money.

Costs 300 to 400  per person for a meal. Definitely worth a try if you're into street food but in a decent setup. No washrooms here."
2,I just recently tried Veg Noodles soup and it was tasteless I didn't like it  full of water and it wasn't worth ‚Çπ250 that I spent.
4,"Great burger joint serving quality burgers at a reasonable price. The smash burger is a must try packed with juicy meat. The sizzling cheese platter looks cinematic but avoidable. The korean chicken poppers were a delightful sweet&sour combo.
Located in a narrow lane, the seating space is minimal which leads to waiting time during peak hours on weekends. The order takes a while to prep too."
4,"A hidden gem, truly! The burgers taste amazing, loaded with cheese and sauce, and while they can get a bit messy, they‚Äôre still delicious. üçî The ambiance is small, with barely 4-5 tables, and it could definitely use some improvement in that area. Sometimes, even on non-peak days, there‚Äôs a wait due to the limited seating. If possible, I‚Äôd love to see them expand to accommodate more customers. This place deserves more space to let everyone experience their great food! üòä"
5,"The place is easy to find through Maps. But please avoid taking huge cars here as it's in a quaint little bylane of Bandra! The place is really cozy with just a few seats but gets almost full as the day passes. The staff is very friendly and also recommends best options basis your taste. We tried the Veg and non veg burgers, fries, few starters and also Kombucha. The Mozzarella sticks here are to die for and must try. Truly amazing experience to just chill with your friends, partner or an alone-meal in peace ‚úåÔ∏è."
4,"Frisbees was talk in the town since opened but now going viral on Instagram I thought why not give it a try. So let‚Äôs begin with -
- Waiting hours : if visiting on weekends you better be prepared to wait for long 1 hour this place is packed and it does take pre-booking but we need to pay some amount (I‚Äôm not sure how much)

- Food : we tried their Nashville burgers and smash burgers and both were super tasty and yum, we also tried their chicken cheese loaded fries with barbecue sauce and this was too yum.

- Ambience : it‚Äôs a small place more for a college student vibe and they do give 10% off to college students üòú

- Service : good but little slow."
3,Had the smash burger and Nashville burger i honestly thought Nashville was going to be the good one and smash not so but the smash one turned out really tasty. Nashville one was a so so the french fries were too crispy and stale and even bland. Smash burger is a must try though ü§åüèº
5,"Had a great delivery experience with Smoke House Deli! The packaging was neat and secure, everything arrived fresh and warm. Tried their new Delizza single-serve pizzas super gourmet and full of flavor. The Spicy Cottage Cheese had the perfect kick, and the Pulled Roast Chicken & Pesto was pure comfort. Crisp base, generous toppings, and that cheesy pull was next level. Definitely a step up from the usual pizza night. Ordered via Swiggy, Zomato or Dotpe and the delivery was right on time. Highly recommend for a quick, indulgent treat!"
5,"Had breakfast on a regular weekday so there was a decent seating space available. They have a LOT of options, which can cater to the mood and exact dish we were looking for. All the food tasted good and with decent portions.
On a side note, I had accidentally spilled my coffee and they immediately brought another one for me and promptly cleaned up the table and area! Amazing hospitality, will definitely visit again."
5,"""I visited Smoke House Deli, Pali tonight with family, and we were all blown away by the quality of the food and the service.
The menu offered a great selection of options and the most  standout dish is Cottage Cheese Galletes.
The prices were very reasonable, especially considering the generous portion sizes. Overall, I highly recommend Smoke House Deli, Pali  and can't wait to return!""
Special mention to our server - Shashikant"
4,"Can't stop raving about this incredible funghii pizza that my husband & I gobbled our hearts out.....Oh, the crust was perfectly cooked with just right amount of crunch and chew! ...and a huge shout out to that layer of their inhouse white truffle sauce for adding that sweet and earthy note to every bite. 5/5 for this one and would highly recommend it to all fellow shroom-lovers!
Next, we also tried their market veggie pizza - a feather-light crust, delish herby sauce & a generous portion of farm fresh veggies. 3/5 for this one.
All in all, great service, a warm and cozy ambience coupled with scrumptious food - Smoke House Deli, Bandra hits all check boxes for a perfect dinner date or that girlie-soiree you're looking for!! ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°"
5,"Had a wonderful time at the smokehouse deli. After a tiring day of shopping, me and my bestie needed a place to chill and catch up. The staff there was helpful, kind and accommodative. They were patient while taking our pics and listened to all our crazy notes and remarks while chiming right with us. The food was on point. Enjoyed the lamb kibeh and filet mignon. Do try their house red wine. Us noobs enjoyed it. It was the perfect pairing with our catch up.
Thank you Sonal and Santosh for an amazing day. Will definitely come again."
4,"The food was really tasty. I personally liked the stuffed tandoori mushrooms and chef special boneless butter chicken. Value for money. Not very expensive. The quantity it served was also good. The ambience was okay though. Not very great. A very small place and not very crowded. I would love to order from here. I'm giving a 4 star only because of the ambience. We visited this place for dinner and lot of insects keep irritating you while dine in. I would not recommend this place for dine in but if you want to order, definitely it is a very good choice. Go for it."
5,"An absolute delight! From the moment we walked in, the warm ambiance and friendly staff made us feel welcome. The food was exceptional‚Äîeach dish was flavorful, well-presented, and cooked to perfection. The service was impeccable, with attentive staff ensuring we had everything we needed without being intrusive. The restaurant‚Äôs attention to detail, from the d√©cor to the carefully curated menu, truly sets it apart. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a top-notch dining experience!"
5,"Butter Chicken Factory in Bandra is a haven for butter chicken enthusiasts. The restaurant's rendition of this classic dish is a delightful symphony of flavors ‚Äì the chicken is perfectly marinated, the creamy tomato-based gravy strikes a harmonious balance of spice and sweetness. Each bite is a journey for the senses, a true culinary delight.

Sujeet's service adds a personal touch to the dining experience, ensuring a memorable visit. The mocktails, especially Pudeena Pani and Masala Shikanje, provide a refreshing start to the meal.

The Kabab Platter showcases a variety of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian delights. From the succulent Paneer Tikka to the flavorful Chicken Seekh Kebab, the assortment caters to diverse preferences.

Moving on to the mains, the Butter Chicken steals the show with its rich and decadent texture. Complemented by Butter Paneer and Dal Makhani, the restaurant offers a fulfilling array of choices.

The Bread Basket, featuring Chilli Garlic Laccha Paratha, Tandoori Roti, Pudina Paratha, and Churchur Naan, provides the perfect accompaniment to soak up the flavorful gravies. Rice lovers are not forgotten, as the restaurant offers a satisfying selection.

The meal concludes on a sweet note with Gulab Jamun, leaving diners with a lingering sweetness that perfectly caps off the gastronomic journey. Butter Chicken Factory in Bandra is undeniably a go-to spot for those seeking an authentic and indulgent butter chicken experience in Mumbai."
1,This place is completely misleading. They've posted reviews as if it's a dine in with pictures of proper seating spaces. Please remove your listing under a restaurant and highlight it as a cloud kitchen. The place comes up first in the list of restaurant searches in the vicinty and is a complete waste of time for first time customers.
5,"The best corner in Pali hill to enjoy lip smacking and authentic North Indian and Mughlai cuisine!

Compact outlet with amazing interiors and super comfortable seating! Their food menu is fantastic and has large varieties for both vegetarians and non vegetarians! Totally loved the quality of food that is being served here. Polite staff and excellent service.

We went here for dinner! Tried few refreshing drinks and delicious food. Aam panna and Shikanji are definitely a must try at this place.

For the appetizers we had dahi ke kebabs, stuffed tandoori Mushrooms, soya tikka Achari and Paneer tikka!

Believe me Dahi ke kebab was out of the world and I bet it's one of the best that you will get in Mumbai, crisp and hot outside, melting flavours fresh infused curd inside. Served along with mint dip! I actually finished one entire plate! Highly recommend trying this!

Paneer Tikka, fresh soft paneer chunks very well marinated and grilled to perfection in a clay pot oven! Marination is the magic and they know it very well. Loved it.

Soya tikka achari, juicy and well marinated soya chaap with perfect texture and taste. Not too much chewy is what defines the perfect chaap and this was indeed perfect. Exactly delhi style chaap. It will definitely delight you if you are a chaap lover!

For the mains we had, Dal makhni with steam rice, butter chicken, kadai panner and some super soft and piping hot roti basket.

Butter chicken, very well cooked tender and juicy chicken in absolutely velvety gravy loaded with butter! Flavour bomb in each bite and it literally melts in mouth! Definitely a not to miss dish when at this place! Pair it with rice or paratha or tandoori roti it's totally heaven in all combinations!

Paneer Kadai! To all my vegetarian friends don't go by the name! This place serves absolutely delicious vegetarian food too. Fresh veggies, soft paneer chunks and apt amount of spices and mild hint of ajwain! Had a lip smacking paneer gravy after very long time.

Dal makhni! Slow cooked, perfect texture, melt in mouth and great aroma. Portion size good enough for two. We paired it with steam rice, long grains quality rice, cooked to perfection, fluffy as required.

To complete this lovely dinner we ordered their house made gulkand ice-cream, top notch presentation and it was completely like a Paan. Rich creamy with perfect consistency. Do try this it will definitely delight you.

Overall, value for money place to enjoy Authentic north Indian and Mughlai food. We just loved the quality and taste of food that is being served at this place. Overall it was amazing experience."
3,"Had a Mutton Shashlik sizzler at Yoko which was good though I could have listened to the waiter's recommendation of opting for a buff or maybe chicken as he did mention meat being a little tough.

The ambience was very good. A little disappointment was the fish n chips where the fish was bad and we had to return it.

Did enjoy the Virgin Mohito though. It was good."
3,"We tried combo meal veg sizzler + mocktail+icecream brownie dessert
And fried rice.

Veg sizzler was not upto the mark
Taste wise food was okay."
5,"This place is our family all-time favourite. We love the sizzlers here. Lately, they have created a new menu with a lot of addition to their menu items. The service is great with welcoming staff. The ambiance is a little chaotic with mainly big families. Also, they are always super busy and full."
3,"The sizzlers here are genuinely delicious and packed with flavor! üòãüî• However, the portion size is quite small, especially for someone with a big appetite. üçñüçõ As a man, I found that even a whole sizzler wasn‚Äôt enough to fill me up. üòï For the price they charge, they should either increase the quantity or offer a side to make it more satisfying. ü§ëüçΩ Overall, great taste but not sufficient for a hearty meal. üç¥"
3,"Visited this place last weekend with friends on an impromptu plan.

Has a valet service.

Accommodated my dietary requirements of without onion.

Seating was easily available.

The sizzlers were made well.

It was a short affair & we exited quickly.

Lavatories were clean & staff was helpful."
5,"Where else does the barista (Anil) make a portrait of you in your matcha latte? One of my favorite restaurants in the world, not just mumbai. Healthy, delicious, innovative food that connects you to a higher plane. Thoughtful, joyful team. An unmissable experience."
5,I discovered sequel ages ago maybe 12 y. And every time I visit I‚Äôm just as content and happy with the meals. It‚Äôs just the OG clean food place before the trend began. Kudos to the owners to never dilute any aspect of what they stand for. Highly commendable. I enjoy my meals so much that I forget to take photos. But here I managed one of the yum cacao ice cream ‚ù§Ô∏è
4,"Dearest Readers,

In the labyrinthine lanes of Bandra, where old-world charm pirouettes with modern indulgence, there lies a caf√© of quiet sophistication. Sequel‚Äîa name that suggests continuation, yet one wonders, a continuation of what? A revolution in dining? Or merely the latest chapter in Mumbai‚Äôs love affair with organic gastronomy, where virtue is plated with a side of austerity?

This writer, an Australian traveler with a penchant for both indulgence and authenticity, ventured into this minimalist haven with a companion from Belgium‚Äîtwo wanderers in search of flavor, yet confronted instead by restraint. The walls, plain yet inviting, whispered of curated simplicity. No ostentatious chandeliers, no grandiose flourishes‚Äîjust the promise of clean eating, a luxury in an age where excess reigns supreme.

The meal arrived in delicate, almost reverent portions. Dosas‚Äîwhose names I shall not dare pronounce‚Äîgraced our table, each crisp and golden, paired with chutneys so refined they seemed almost hesitant to assert themselves. A sev puri, its puris crafted from noble jowar rather than villainous refined flour, stood as a testament to tradition with a modern conscience. The flavors? Impeccable. The portions? One might call them dainty‚Äîor, if one were less charitable, a mere suggestion of a meal.

But just as one feared this experience would dissolve into an exercise in restrained appreciation, redemption arrived in a porcelain cup. A flat white‚Äîbold, velvety, and so exquisitely brewed, it could hold its own in the caf√©s of Melbourne, a city where coffee is nothing short of sacred. For a fleeting moment, this traveler felt at home, cradling a cup of perfection in the heart of Bandra.

Sequel Caf√© is a place of undeniable quality, where each bite is crafted with care, and each ingredient speaks of purity. And yet, one cannot help but ask‚Äîmust the pursuit of clean eating come at the cost of satiation? A caf√© that serves nourishment for the body, certainly. But for the soul? Perhaps, dear reader, a touch more would not go amiss.

Until next time, dear readers, stay satiated."
4,"My second time here and it‚Äôs my go to if I want something healthy and fresh! I needed something to take on the road and I knew I could get something fast and healthy to fuel me before dinner.

Got the Sev Puri which I had last time and was absolutely delicious but this time it was a little on the salty side.

The A√ßai Bowl which was great but it was more on the tart side so just fyi.

The unbeatable glow which was so good!

Overall it‚Äôs a cute healthy little spot to check out in Bandra. The staff is nice and the place is well maintained!"
4,"Must orders are the energy bowl & mushroom platter, found the ragi dosa very ok whereas the condiments served with it were very interesting to try!
The staff were very courteous and hospitable.
Definitely going back again soon."
5,Very good place to eat food must try people and me were praising the food people were dying to eat the food.... if you want to come get the car because it's not a sitting it's just a takeaway or you can stand and eat or get your car and bike.... try all of the meals you will be praising the food.... it is located at khar west
4,"Great place to order in from.
Try the lamb sliders and the mutton sheekh n rice."
4,"Loved the Baos here. It makes it accessible to everyone unlike places where you have to take a 2 week reservation. Feel like having Baos, Call up Food arto."
5,The Best Paneer Shawarma I ever had till now. So fresh & the filling was so delicious. Service is also good.
5,"Great food
Try out the chicken cheese fries.
And shawarma üëåüëåüëå"
5,Super nice place..bit congested but that‚Äôs giving old cafe vibe and food is absolutely mouthwatering..loved the ambiance and atmosphere there..Do try Lemon Chicken ..loved it ‚ô•Ô∏èüôåüèª
4,"Yacht Bar on Hill Road is a must-visit destination for foodies and partygoers alike! Their extensive range of starters is incredibly delicious. Both AC and outdoor seating areas available. Please note that smoking is only permitted in the outdoor section.

The seating area is utilized efficiently, making the most of the available space. However, the tables are positioned quite close together, which can make the space feel a bit congested. Despite this, the overall atmosphere remains lively and inviting.

The only drawback is that the service can be a bit slow, especially during peak hours when it gets very crowded. Be prepared to wait, but trust me, it's worth it.

I will recommend to try lemon chicken and obviously chakali with schezwan sauce as combination tastes really nice."
5,"A congested but super lively environment on weekends, one might have to wait for the seating as they don't take pre-booking. The food is amazing no matter what one orders. The staff is nice and quick to respond. It's a go to if you are not looking for a luxury or comfortable ambience. Super budget friendly, amazing foods, drinks and ambience especially with a bunch of friends. A must try for sure."
3,"If you‚Äôre looking for an affordable spot to drink and chill in Bandra, Yacht Bar & Restaurant is worth checking out ‚Äì but don‚Äôt go expecting luxury. It‚Äôs a no-frills, budget-friendly place that‚Äôs been around for ages and is popular, especially with the younger crowd.

Ambience and Crowd:
We visited on a weekend around 11:00 PM and the place was packed. It‚Äôs quite congested, so don‚Äôt expect much elbow room. We had to wait for 20 minutes before getting a table, which wasn‚Äôt surprising given its reputation for cheap drinks. They have two sections ‚Äì AC and non-AC. We opted for the AC section, which was relatively comfortable.

Service and Drinks:
The staff was polite and fast, which was impressive given the crowd. The liquor here is very affordable, which explains why it‚Äôs so popular. It‚Äôs perfect if you‚Äôre on a tight budget and looking for a place to hang out with friends.

Food Experience:
The food, however, was disappointing. We tried the Chicken Crispy, a recommendation from the waiter, but it was dry and tough to chew. On the bright side, we enjoyed the chakli with Schezwan sauce.

Facilities:
Despite the heavy crowd, the washrooms were clean and there‚Äôs enough parking space available, which is a big plus in Bandra.

Final Thoughts:
Yacht Bar & Restaurant isn‚Äôt for everyone, but it‚Äôs a great option if you‚Äôre looking for a budget-friendly place to drink and chill. The crowd and ambiance might not be ideal for a quiet evening and the food could use improvement, but for cheap booze and a lively vibe, it gets the job done."
5,"Best bar in Bandra. Great atmosphere, and perfect place to people watch and eat/drink/talk the evening away.

Chicken lollypops delicious, with a spicy peanut sauce. Cold beers. Note that the tandoors don't fire up until 7pm."
4,"Absolutely delicious and mouth watering donuts. If you are tired of shopping from Hill road or Linking road then just have this donuts , they are mind blowing. Specially Double trouble.

Pocket Friendly
Hygeine upto the mark
Friendly Staff
Good Place to spend sometime with coffee and donuts.

Check out the price Online !"
4,Great place if you love donuts. They're serving mouth watering desserts at a super affordable price. Their eclairs are amazing too! Very light and the texture is divine. Definitely a must try if you have a sweet tooth!
4,It's near the Bandra link road shopping area and we have many shops and places around. The service is fine and good for people who like donuts. You can take parcel or have it there. You have two tables to have food. The place is small. They sometimes have offer. We had offer in dine out where for 3 donuts 3 donuts free we got. So you can keep checking for offers online when you visit here
4,Donut quality is far far way better than regular bakeries.
4,As the name suggest if u mad over donuts then sure MOD is the place to go .For years been a fan of the death by chocolate .Just heat it a bit and it melts in ur mouth .The donuts are simple wow and also pure veg .The package deals are a good options where u get to try more options .Pocket friendly high on quality and very filling With great packaging MOD is a winner .
5,"Salim Shahi Sigdi at Pali Hill, Bandra West, is a true gem, bustling with excitement from evening until late into the night. A favorite among celebrities, this spot serves up mouthwatering Mughlai, Chinese, and traditional dishes. The mutton seekh kebabs are a midnight treat, while the Shahi Tikka Chicken, with its rich dahi, and the creamy Afghani Chicken are simply delicious. The Paneer Tikka is also worth a try, but my personal favorite was the Chicken Baida Roti. Everything was fantastic‚Äî10/10. If you‚Äôre in Pali Hill, this place is a must-visit"
1,"The menu looks promising but the ambience, service and the food is terrible. I had ordered 2 paneer tikka rolls and one kalimiri fish roll with cream. The order took a really long time to prepare and when we took it home and started eating, the rolls had no taste, no salt and tasted really bland. I called up the outlet and spoke to the manager, a bearded bespectacled man named Mubeen who said that that is the way the roll os made and that they had already informed us about the cream making the roll tasteless. This was untrue. The fish was not marinated well, there was no salt and the attitude of the manager made sure that I will never order from this place again. The rolls are not cheap and they are not worth the money you pay for it. There are much better places around like Khane Khaas or Miya Kebabs for better rolls. Avoid this place!"
3,I had the mutton Seekh Kebab with Rumali Roti. The staff was friendly and served me freshly barbecued kebab because I visited exactly when they opened between 12:30pm-1:00pm.
5,Variety of kebab and grill. Sometimes have lots of people eating on roadside.
5,"I love their place. It is a very small street type place to have good food. If you are a 'Bade miya's' colaba fan, then you can definitely relish the same taste by living it near bandra."
3,Decent reasonable place to dine. We tried only Paneer chilly Rs 215. Very limited space in bandra west. It was good!
5,"This hotel caught my eye all of sudden, the food was absolutely amazing, with budget friendly every dish was flavourful. Highly recommend anyone looking for a great place to eat."
5,This restuarant has changed my view over Vegetarian Food. Right from the Boondi Raita to the Chole Pulav to the Noodles (Chinese) to the Ice Cream.... You would 100% enjoy every bit....üòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòã Highly Recommend this restaurant. The Chef is toooooo good. ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©ü§© the Best Veg Food had ever!!!
1,"It's famous for pav bhaji, don't eat anything else here. Some reasons are as follows:
1) Burnt garlic noodles had cashews and raisins which ruined the flavour, still it was the best among all the items we had here.
2) French fries were without any seasoning and tasted very bland.
3) Ordered Manchurian rice and got ""Manchurian in gravy"" with fried rice. Taste wasn't good.
4) Alfredo pasta ! Please don't order it."
5,Have been going to Gokul since the early 1990‚Äôs.  The pav bhaji has always been amazing. A lot has changed in recent times and new items on the menu however we usually stick to the pav bhaji as our usual order. Did try the rajma and paratha and it was decent (but secretly wished I had taken the pav bhaji). Service as usual was quick.
4,"Box 8 is always my go to place for ordering good meal. It gives a wholesome expirience. My friends had come over sowei ordered 3 Paratha wraps.

1) Seekh Kebab Wrap: Succulent Seekh Kebab peices that just melt in your mouth with some spicy sauces.

2) Chicken Tikka Wrap: This come with a whole wheat paratha so that you won't feel guilty while eating. The tikka sauce they use is also great.

3) Roasted Chicken wrap: This comes with my favourite dressing which is the Thousand Island dressing. My all time favourite wrap.

We also ordered a starter which was chicken Chur Chur.

Overall loved the service, the packaging was great. The wraps came in aluminium foil and were pretty warm."
4,I ordered Desserts from Box 8 for a home party. gulab jambun was mouth watering and warm. choco lawa cake was full of liquid chocolate and brownie was all chocolaty. It filled all urges of chocolate.
5,"Here's a detailed description of all we ordered:-

Roasted Chicken Paratha Wrap

Chicken flavoured with cinnamon and garlic inside a steaming hot paratha. Moonh mein pani experience!

Chicken XXL Paratha Wrap

3 chicken types wrapped in one big wrap giving you a relishing experience at every bite.

Chicken Cheese Feast Sandwich

Chicken pieces liberally topped with cheese and served in a sandwich style. Quite filling and fulfilling.

Fusion Chicken Sandwich

Tikka style chicken in a yummy mayo dressing, not the best but probably something you should give a try.

Tandoori Chicken Sandwich

Grilled tandoori chicken served on toasted bread spread with a mayonnaise spiked with mint, cilantro and chili. Truly appetising and mouth watering.

Murg Dum Biryani

Aromatic murgh dum biryani which was really flavourful alongwith charred chicken. The pieces of chicken was tender and crispy

Choco Lava Cake

Crunchy on the outside with gooey, liquid chocolate on the inside, the best dessert to end a satisfying meal.

The best part was the speed of delivery, really quick. The food was packed really well and it was fresh for consumption. Had a tasteful experience. Look forward to ordering from BOX8 again."

Ratings: 5/5"
4,The food is good to order at office. The packing makes it easy to eat. I ordered dilli wale rajma chawal box. It tastes good except that i found the quantity to be a lil less.
5,"Bastian Bandra is a fantastic spot with a lively atmosphere, friendly staff, and great food. The highlight was definitely the pull-me-up cake‚Äîit was absolutely divine! The bao buns were good too. A perfect place to indulge and enjoy a memorable dining experience."
5,"Exceptional experience from the aroma when you first walk in to the exceptional dining experience. I highly recommend trying out their Mac and cheese, lobster roll and to drink the Lychee Sunset Virgin Mocktail.

In terms of dessert definitely try out the Hazelnut Crunch Pull Me Cake - divine and so moist"
4,"Restaurant Review:

I recently visited this restaurant and found the experience to be quite underwhelming, especially considering the high prices they charge. Having dined at fine establishments in prime locations like London and Manhattan, I was surprised to find this place even more costly, without offering a comparable level of service or quality.

The food was decent but certainly not worth the steep prices. The interior design is basic and lacks the charm or sophistication one would expect from a high-end dining venue. It seems more focused on social media appeal rather than providing genuine hospitality.

For those who prioritize value for money and a memorable dining experience, there are numerous other establishments that offer superior service, ambiance, and cuisine at more reasonable prices. This visit highlighted some of the challenges facing the Indian hospitality sector, where style often overshadows substance."
4,Good food and love the interiors. The staffs were very courteous.
4,"Bastian came recommended by a native 'foodie' friend of ours. Tucked away in the hustle and bustle of linking road, Bastian has a small entrance that's easy to miss. We were the first to walk in at 7pm, however, the restaurant was jam packed by 7:20pm with mostly locals. Service was courteous, food arrived on time and the ambiance was very relaxing. Elaborate menu. everything we tried was extremely tasty and cooked to perfection. We ate way more than normal. Mid-high range prices. Overall, a very pleasant experience. The locals would call it 'yum'. Highly recommended."
1,The food was ok but the workers were unhygienic i got multiple hair in my food which killed my appetite hence qould never visit again as hygiene is more important for me than taste.
3,"Good food, and good service, really good place to have some small meals"
4,They have one of tge best Chinese taste in that local visinitey
5,"Best hotel in mankhurd, clean hotel, and food is excellent"
4,Food quality is very good love itüòã
5,"One of the best retro cum bars in Navi Mumbai. Located in a prime location, it offers a unique ambiance with retro-themed decor. The bar boasts an extensive selection of cocktails, including some nostalgic favorites with a twist. The food menu features a fusion of classic and modern dishes, with a good variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. The service is prompt and attentive, and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The overall vibe is lively and nostalgic, making it a great place to unwind and enjoy a night out with friends. Highly recommended for those who love retro vibes and a wide range of drinks!"
3,"Good place for drinking and eating, Rate are competitive and Mankhurd's famous Restaurant and Bar."
5,Best and cheap place to have drinks and enjoy with friends and I don't recommend this place for family and gf. But with friends it's cheap and best food is ok ok type but ambience is quiet good.
5,Best place to relax & chill out with a Beer Mug or Whiskey Glass in your hand. Liked the ambience at Sheetal Restaurant
5,Nice ambience with good taste .. like to service fast and very polite.
5,"The ambience of the outlet is nice with good music with positive vibes.

A very pleasant staff to make it a delightful experience. Service is good and the staff is very polite.

They offer a large variety of pizzas with an option for half n half.

A very nice place for a quick bite"
4,Juno's Pizza is the best of two worlds as you get a variety of delicious Italian and Pizza items under one roof. The quick-service restaurant gives you an indulgence that makes you vouch for the place. This chain of pure-veg outlet is an ideal place for people who want to give their palates a mouth-watering twist and at affordable prices
5,"Another Pizza Chain Outlet added to the Island City. Juno‚Äôs can give a tough competition with its cordial customer service care and value for money menu.

The interiors are good, some soft music playing although a small place but they have decorated it well.

Service was fabulous, especially our servers Deepak & Sunil were  amicable in explaining which dish to order. Also one of the customers had come for a birthday dinner and they arranged a dessert for them voluntarily which was benign.

Overall a perfect place for Pizzas do try their MAXIMUM pizza if you are large in number. A signature dish of Juno‚Äôs"
5,Junos one of the best pizza collections they have. Their service and ambience is too good. The pizza is so soft and the garlic bread are yummy. Do try their boss's favourite. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
5,If you're into Pizza and stuff this place is for you. Food tastes good with an amazing quality. Ambience is very good with beautiful music. The staff here is very Friendly and polite. There are various options available in Pizzas and Pastas. Good place to go out with friends and family. So just give it a try.

3,"Located in Chembur, You'll probably miss it if you're not looking for it.
.
We went here to have lunch and ordered
Corn cheese balls
Chicken Handi
Chicken do pyaza
Roti Tokri
Daal khichdi

The Corn Cheese Balls were good, they definitely made it not tasted like packaged Cheese Balls so that's a plus point, Plus the sauce they served it with was a unique sweet and spicy tomato sauce.
.
Next the Chicken Handi & Chicken Do Pyaza.
Taste wise both were quite similar and the chicken was very succulent and had a well balanced taste, the only down side was the quantity.
A full chicken handi can barely feed two grownups were as a chicken handis are known to be a group feeder.
Same story for the Chicken Do Pyaza.
.
The Roti Tokr had Six different kinds of roti's cut in half.
I would suggest avoid it and directly get whatever roti you prefer individually.
.
Daal Khichdi, Ordered it just because the Handi and Chicken Do Pyaza was not enough to fill the pit in our stomachs.
Taste wise it was ok nothing special.
.
The place has pleasant ambiance and amazing staff for service.
But the food does not do justice to the price.
Prices are on the high side and the money to value (quantity) ratio is low.
.
Overall: 3/5"
5,Awesome food. Great service. Nice staff. Both veg and non veg available. Platters also available. Economic and fine dine ambience. Understaffed.
1,"Pathetic service one guy in the afternoon to serve,  dressed up in suit, after 10 mins of wait when we asked for menu card,  we were rudely told will take more time to get the card, can't comment on food as we were not lucky enough to get it, strongly a no no to this place"
5,"Oh my so so dear eatout place

Being very close to where I stay is not the only reason it is first on my list of favorites. The place is always reasonably quiet. Rarely crowded. It is because their main business is home delivery. We also order food home from here.

The other reason is pretty quick service, and a large variety of dishes. My favorite is sizzlers, and being a veggie by choice, somebody offering me a choice of vegetable sizzlers needs to be really appreciated. Other dishes - starters, main course and desserts - you always have plenty of choice. And whatever you order, it is guaranteed to be tasty.

The prices are fairly reasonable, for the quality and quantity served.

Overall, it's a place that leaves you with a very good taste for a long long time."
5,"Good place if you are looking for food in a budget. Veg and non veg both type of food available, mostly people come here in lunch hours as there are many offices close by, so people come here in the lunch time to have lunch. So, if you want less crowd here then go after lunch hours. You will then able to enjoy the food calmly. Also, friendly staff."
5,Nice place for a quick snack to a full meal . Price is reasonable and food is vegetarian.
4,"Ordered idli and medu vada from Mukta‚Äôs Kitchen (Chembur)
The idlis were soft and decent ‚Äì not super fluffy, but did the job. Great with the sambar, which was actually the highlight of the meal ‚Äì warm, flavorful, and comforting.

The chutney, though, was underwhelming ‚Äì lacked freshness and that signature coconut punch. Definitely didn‚Äôt match up to the rest.

As for the medu vada, it was crunchy and satisfying, but way too oily ‚Äì like, proper dripping oily. Could‚Äôve been so much better with proper draining.

Overall, a decent South Indian fix if you‚Äôre craving something quick, but they seriously need to up their chutney game and keep an eye on the oil!"
4,"it's a very nice restaurant in that locality, very neat and clean interior, and the staff are well behaved. The food quality and taste is top notch. u can see your food being cooked in front of u. Pricing is also affordable."
5,"Mukta's Kitchen provides pure vegetarian food with wider variety of selection from North Indian to South Indian and also serves Chinese delicacy.
Spacious seating with non-aircon restaurant, quality food with value for money."
4,"It is a nice place to have food, especially if you are a strict vegetarian ( veg food is hard to find in surrounding area).
I loved the way owner upheld his GSB identity and promoted his local dishes.
Service is good, neat and tidy surroundings.
Food tastes fairly okay, but podi and rawa adai are too delicious. One must try."
1,"Has been yesterday along with family to this restaurant . As soon as entered was disappointed with the ambience as was looking more like a normal bar and restaurant. Very noisy and dim lights . We ordered prawns butter garlic . There was no sign of butter or garlic and more like tandoor prawns . When asked the manager just mentioned that this is what they prepare
The Amritsari fish in main course was having too much salt and fish was not too good
The pav bhaji fondue was also not great . The pav was more or less like butter toast broken in very small pieces and bhaji was again having salt with no tase at all . The chur chur pratha  , butter nan were like rubber . Service was pathetic and despite having so many table boys a single person used to mange at all tables especially when billing was to be settled .
Not at all recommended as rates are very high compared to portion served and quality"
1,"I had planned  a dinner with my extended family and we were 25 of us for dinner. They offered us a set menu being a large group and when they started serving the food was kept pre cooked and was served cold. On informing them to serve hot food they microwaved it sevred again. The fish was fried twice which actually spoiled the taste.
Will never recommend india bistro and did not expect this"
2,"Yesterday, we visited India Bristo for my niece‚Äôs birthday, but the service was extremely disappointing. Starters took  more than 40 minutes to arrive, and after finishing them, we waited over an hour just to place our main course order. Despite requesting many staff members, we were repeatedly ignored. Once the order was finally taken, it took another 30 minutes to be served. With a limited menu, such delays were unacceptable. The staff‚Äôs indifferent and lackadaisical attitude ruined the celebration spirit of that special evening. Further, the ambience was chaotic ‚Äî filled with shouting and very loud  conversations ‚Äî making it impossible to enjoy the meal.
I would only recommend this restaurant to those with plenty of time and no real expectations for service."
5,"Very good service. Knowledgeable staff. There is 50% discount on zomato gold and swiggy one subscription. Food is up to mark. Nicely cooked, well presented and served. Been there thrice now and have never been disappointed. A bit costly but with discount it is very affordable. Quiet place with trendy crowd. Aam panna is very tasty i heard and so it the chicken soup. We went as a group of 5 , took buffet and bill was just 6050 which came to 2775 with swiggy one subscription discount. We were soo full. They gave a lot of starters including two chicken items, chicken soup, mutton fingers fish fry kind , lime juice, main course and tasty dessert- kulfi and gulab jamun. Everything was worth!!"
4,"Dhaba style sitting, kids play area, plenty of parking available.
The Mutton Rana Kepsa was yum, even the gravy of Paneer was awesome.
Must try is mutton raan if you are 4-5 people.
Service was a bit slow.
Ambience is cool and comfortable."
5,"Service and everything is super good., üíØ
Totally happy and satisfied.ü©∑
All the items are amazinggg super tasty üçΩÔ∏è and my favorite is
1. Chicken nadan crispy with 7up.
2. White tandoori.
3. Prawns biryani.
4. Chicken kadhai."
5,"I went to this restaurant today and I must say that it's one of the best places for Chinese and tandoori food in Chembur. I tried the following dishes -

chicken satay _ nicely grilled and loaded with spicy sauce
chicken crunchy _ crispy & tasty
chicken peri peri tikka _ succulent & spicy
chicken galouti kebab _ soft & melt in mouth
chicken Schezwan fried rice _ tasty and flavorful.

Service was a bit slow but the staff was polite and courteous. Highly recommended."
2,"I went to this Restaurant today and i experienced very pathetic service. They were serving all the orders very fast which is not normal than other time. Bcz of which food was getting cold. Rotis that i ordered very getting hard. Food was very Spicy. I told him while giving order to make it very midium but it was toooooo spicy.

Icing on the cake is Manu card and Bill amounts are different. Example Roti, Chapati, butter milk all rates are different then manu card and in the bill. Check my photos"
5,"Badri Restaurant offers an exceptional dining experience with top-quality food and outstanding service. Every dish is rich in flavor and freshly prepared, reflecting true culinary excellence. The staff is courteous, attentive, and ensures that every guest feels welcomed and satisfied. A perfect place for anyone who appreciates great food and warm hospitality."
4,The taste was good and worthy but please only  take care of spicy in some dishes because  After choosing spicy dish also it was not spicy
2,My hubby and I went to have food here as per many reviews we got from our friends. We ordered chicken biriyani. It had cost us 390/- for 1 biriyani. The quantity of rice was very less with just 1 small chicken piece and also the taste was not even worth the price. It had very less salt in it and too much masala. Felt very disappointed after having this biriyani. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone. It is not worth the money you pay.
2,"Not worth the hype at all, it's really overrated. Had heard so much about them & thought I would get to taste some authentic Mughlai flavours but it did not live up to my expectations. Very very average taste. Chicken seekh kebab did not feel like freshly prepared, it felt like they were the frozen ones which are just heated before being served, Chicken biryani did not have any flavours was too simple. The prices are also high compared to the food they are serving."
2,"I have a little mixed review:
First of all, it took 40 mins for the order to arrive at the table. I was told that some staff members are on leave, due to which the order delayed. This I can understand, but if we would have been informed while ordering itself, it would have been much helpful, as we had to wait so long being hungry. We checked in between, where we were just told that it would take a few minutes every time we asked. That wait was too long!

Secondly, we had ordered Fish tikka, and the quantity of the fish was a joke: there were 3 pieces which were not even the size of my index finger. It was 90% gravy and 10% fish. I have had Basa fish and fish tikka in many restaurants, but never had such low to almost no meat proportion in dishes.

The biryani was decent, and the service was decent apart from the above issue. The host was cheerful and helpful overall.

This is my constructive detailed feedback, which I hope the hotel will take it to improve their service, given that they have such a good reputation across Mumbai having photos on their walls with Bollywood celebrities and cricketers."
5,Extremely wonderful. The food was great. Do not miss chicken lollipops here.  The ambience is tranquil and amazing. One can have a serene and ultimate experience of dining here.
1,One of the most average mutton biryani was eaten finally here üòÄ I can't believe such crap from this place. Shameful if a restaurant can't serve palatable food
5,"The packing of the food was excellent and the quantity of all the dishes was very good.
We had
Soya Keema Mini Samosa: It was well stuffed and tasty
Veg Khasta Kebab: The kebab were soft and delicious.
The chutney with the Samosa and Kabab was yummy.
Paneer Bhuna Roll: It was loaded with Paneer and tasted awesome
Ustaadi Hyderabadi Veg Biryani and Dum Spicy Paneer Biryani: Both were full of flavours and tasted authentic..  served with Delightful Raita

Gulab Jamun: It was hot, soft and just melted in the mouth.
Malai Phirn: It tasted heavenly in that khulad.

Surely going to order again & again"
5,"This Place is a Biryani Specialist Food Outlet. Ordered Ustadi Hyderabadi Biryani, Gulab Jamun, Malai Paneer Starter, Chocolate Paan.

Let me tell you the quality of food was really good. There was taste in every bite we had, though it be a sweet or spicy biryaani. All types of Biryanis are a Must Must Must Tryyyy.

We really loved it. Will surely order again"
5,"I am very impressed by how fast the service was done with piping hot food served at door step.
The quantity is very gracious for 2 people easily. The biryani was very well made along with mild flavors with no so spicy yet mild with the perfect blend of spices and the makhani gravy blend in well with the rice and the aroma is very strong and mild with soft paneer going perfectly well with the onion  raita. The first time i have had veg seekh kebab and i must say the kebab is very soft touch to the filling well tandoored making it have a nice smokey touch to the kebab. Best finished meal with khoya Gulab Jamun totally loved the soft and not so sweet gulab jamun. Also must say the chocolate pan was a total cherry on the cake. Loved my delivery experience at Charcoal eats."
5,"Biryani is an all time yes. The delivery was done quick and the packaging was spill proof.
The presentation of all dishes were good. The biryani serves 1 person which contains 3-4 small pieces of chicken. I loved the aroma & taste of both biryanis but the Makhmali chicken biryani is my fav.
The price is little on higher side but the quality is taken care.
The kebabs were so flavourful served with mint curd chutney , onion rings & lemon. The portion could have been little more but overall it was good.
End your meal perfectly with phirni & chocolate paan.

Dishes tried:
‚ñ™Ô∏éDum Baked Awadhi Chicken biryani
‚ñ™Ô∏éAfgani Chicken seekh

‚ñ™Ô∏éLucknowi chicken seek

5,"Charcoal Eats is best delivery outlet in town.
I ordered Chicken Roll , Chicken Biryani, Afghani Chicken Kabab,  Chaas and Malai Phirni.

All the dishes was delicious and tasty. Biryani was too tasty. Quality of food was also great and amazing.

Talking about packaging it was very clean and Good.
Delivery was also so quick and on time.

Great Experience üíØ

5,"I tried their MOCHA at the newly opened coffee shop and it was just perfect, right amount of flavors and top notch quality. Staff is polite and all other food items are fresh and absolute value for money."
1,"Not allowed to seat inside when buying cakes or pastries, as per service person Mr Vinay, only coffee buyers having facilities to sit inside cake shop. As per Monginis‚Äôs guidelines told by Mr Vinay. How can Monginis treat separate to their customers"
5,Good quality n various variety

4,"Guys, China Bistro got an upgrade!
We finally got ramen on the menu and god it is amazing! It's so big that I'd recommend sharing between two üòÖ. The broth has a silky texture with chili oil glazed on the side so that you can mix as per your spice desires, there is minced chicken on the side ( I ordered the chicken one) and several sticks of bok choy along with some tiny soft chestnut (I never liked nuts but these ones were soft so I was ok) and a sprinkle of sesame seeds on top.
I also got strawberry mochi and it was the best I've ever had! It had a soft pink strawberry icecream with dashes of strawberry syrup, embroidered with fine pistachio and enclosed within soft, chewey, stretchy magenta coloured mochi. It was divided into four big pieces, perfect for sharing.
Other than these there are many new additions which I'll surely try next time. We reserved a table in advance the previous day on Swiggy for a 30% discount. They even gave us 15% discount coupons!
It was the year of the snake themed, outside decorations were also nice, I'd recommend visiting during chinese festivals.
Ë∞¢Ë∞¢"
5,"All the dishes that we ordered were tasty. We only had vegetarian food.
The service was also good. Our server recommended dishes after understanding our preference and none disappointed. We also got great EazyDinder offer."
3,"Our group of six recently visited China Bistro, drawn in by its reputation and positive reviews. While the experience had some highlights, it also left us with mixed feelings. Here‚Äôs a detailed breakdown:

Ambience:

The atmosphere was pleasant and inviting, with a good vibe that set the tone for the evening. The decor and environment made for a comfortable dining experience. Rating: 4/5

Food Experience:

We were a mix of vegetarians and non-vegetarians (3 each), so we tried a variety of dishes across the menu.
‚Ä¢	Soups:
‚Ä¢	Chicken & Veg Lemon Clear Soup
‚Ä¢	Treasure of 8 Chicken & Veg Soup
These were decent but lacked the depth of flavor we expected.
Rating: 3/5
‚Ä¢	Starters:
‚Ä¢	Drums of Heaven (Chicken)
‚Ä¢	Chilly Chicken
‚Ä¢	Veg Dim Sims
The starters were passable but didn‚Äôt stand out, with flavors that were somewhat underwhelming. Rating: 3/5
‚Ä¢	Main Course:
‚Ä¢	Kimchi Fried Rice: Overpowered by excessive spices, making it almost tasteless.
‚Ä¢	Chicken Classic Fried Rice: This was well-prepared and enjoyable.
‚Ä¢	Chicken Hakka Noodles: A good choice for noodle lovers.
‚Ä¢	Schezwan Gravy with Basa Fish: The highlight of the meal, perfectly cooked with balanced flavors.
‚Ä¢	Vegetarian Dishes: Unfortunately, the vegetarian options were far below expectations, with bland and uninspired preparations.
Overall Food Rating: 3/5

Pricing & Service:

The final bill shocked us. For 6 people (3 vegetarians), we paid a hefty ‚Çπ7000, which felt exorbitant given the average quality of the meal. To make matters worse, a service charge was added, which is prohibited post-GST implementation. When we pointed this out, the staff promptly canceled it, but it left us wondering how many customers unknowingly pay these charges.

Value for Money:

The food quality and experience did not justify the steep prices. The restaurant felt overrated and overpriced, leaving us disappointed overall.

Final Verdict:

‚Ä¢	Ambience: 4/5
‚Ä¢	Food: 3/5
‚Ä¢	Service: 3/5
‚Ä¢	Value for Money: 2/5

Overall Rating: 3/5

Key Takeaway: Double-check your bills for unauthorized charges. While the ambience and a few dishes were enjoyable, the overall experience failed to meet expectations, especially at this price point. Proceed with caution if you‚Äôre looking for a value-for-money dining experience."
5,"The food and service both were great, costing around 1200-1300 pp for all the food we had.
Had many options.
Starters were served on the table itself, and the food had to be taken by ourselves.

I'd recommend nonveg buffet has much better options than the veg ones."
5,"Such a nice place for lunch. I went there with a friend of mine. We both non veg. Overall the buffet they served was nice. There are several options that you can try for this and it was oke. Too bad the sushi option is only two and there is no sashimi.

I really like their fried woonton and siomay. Plus the desserts was nice as well"
5,"I have been looking forward to try snacks and i tried at baba snacks for a while now and i was so glad that I did The food was so delicious and the service was really great too!
And also the best part was their chicken cheese ball that was soo yummy and I ate the whole thing even though it was quite heavy for one person."
5,On the way from Navi mumbai we stopped at this small but amazing food stall  and enjoyed their authentic and spicy vada paav and bhaji paav. There is this chai shop just next and they sell amazing chai as well. As soon as you take right from mankhurd signal from vashi towards Ghatkopar. This is gem of a place

Recentyl i visited at this location and i ordered kadai paneer tikka and few more itmos of around 400+ but this resturant and staff bevair was not good i asked them to give me some onion salad they refuesd cause of its too costly.

My opinion is to owner why u have opend this resturant if u unable to give ur customer onion salad."
1,"This is the third class restaurant.
Owner deletes the reviews.
The hotel staff is worst. They hire bunch of useless people. Specially the reception guy with specs is the most illeterate person in the entire hotel.

They don't have respect for how to treat customers and never accepts their mistakes. Bunch of useless people. Now also after reading this comment instead of improving their service. He will make a silly excuse and post here just to look innocent."

4,"A multinational pizza restaurant chain that is widely recognised and has become synonymous with Pizza needs no introduction. Known for their mouthwatering Pizza's and some unique side dishes, we just couldn't resist ourselves from ordering. Their Zero Contact delivery is a huge plus during these times. As usual their packaging was top notch and the delivery arrived quickly.

We ordered Non Veg Loaded, Veg Loaded, Onion & Cheesy Pizza Mania; Garlic Breadsticks, Chicken Parcel & Burger Pizza - Classic Non Veg from here and were happy with the flavour of all of them. Their Pizza Mania section of the menu is a great choice if you are looking for different tastes but don't want to spend a ridiculous amount of money..üòã"
1,"Our experience was the worst; because there was a new offer, we asked the staff about the 99rs meal combo offer, and they told it wasn't available right now, but you could have the 125rs meal combo instead. After ordering the 125rs meal, we had to repeat it twice to clean and clear the table. Air conditioning was quite slow. The order included a Choco bomb, which was quite oily and had a thick chocolate filling. The staff is quite unfriendly."
1,"Bad ambition ever. bad cleaness, no one take care of cleaness of tables, AC is not working, very slow service , first take priority to prepare online orders, offline orders take more time. some pictures is shared for current position of store dated. 23/09/2023.
kinldly look into that before coming this dahisar pizza store."
1,"Pizza was very cold, dry and tasteless, in addition the toppings were all burnt and not at all capable of eating. Domino's is becoming worst and worst day by day. I am very disappointed with services and overall quality."
1,"Despite placing an order that was supposed to be delivered within 30 minutes, it took a staggering 1 hour and 20 minutes for the delivery to arrive. Throughout this time, both the store and the delivery driver were unresponsive to calls, leaving me in the dark about the status of my order.

Furthermore, when the store finally did pick up the phone after 30-45 minutes of trying, I was met with a lack of professionalism and courtesy from the staff member I spoke to. The online app also showed that there was no active order, adding to my frustration.

This level of service is simply unacceptable and reflects poorly on your brand. I expect better from a reputable company like Dominos and demand an explanation for this egregious lack of customer care."
5,"It has one of the most delicious ice creams. There are a lot of options available to choose from. Their seasonal ice creams are very good, and personally, I recommend watermelon and tender coconut. The chocolate flavors are fabulous and are available all the way round. All in all, it is a very good place to have ice creams. Takeaways are also available."
5,"Always been a great experience at Natural's. The quality, taste and flavors of the ice cream has never changed since they opened and always üòã. The place is bright and very pleasant. Spacious and very clean, great for a quick scoop with family or friends."
5,"Always been a great experience at Natural's. The quality, taste and flavors of the ice cream has never changed. The place is Spacious and very clean."
1,"The staff was very rude towards us just because we were teenager friends group. we asked for the tasting and he casually said we have to close the shop so tasting is not available, on the other side a rich family came in asked for tasting and he gave it to them. Thats partiality and so wrong!
Fix this behaviour would be great help to grow your business.
Thank you"
5,"I've not been to a much prettier Naturals outlet than this one yet. It's really spacious, close to the station and again the prettiest. The service is good. It attracts a good crowd. It costs around 150 bucks for 2 person. If you haven't been to this outlet, I'll strongly recommend you to. Cheers :)"
5,I ordered a tandoori chicken sub and it was yummy. The sweet sauce was very tasty. The service was fast and staff was courteous. Tables were cleaned promptly.
1,"This is the worst outlet, there is no proper management, employees do not care about providing service,.They will serve you anything other than the food you order"
4,This is located in Borivali West. The ambience is good. Easy to access. Sitting is comfortable. Good Staff. The food quality is higenic. They server both veg and non veg. Good place to have a quick bit.
5,"Subway has always been my go to whenever I want to have something which is stomach filling and at the same is healthy.
My favourite has been Aloo tikki and mexican patty sub with Chipotle, Mayo and Barbeque sauce.
One of the must try places if you are craving for something tasty and healthy!"
1,Worst than others no option of giving 0star ...just for giving they had served... just onions and capsicum no jalapenos even less sauce just tasting dry
5,"Have been visiting this place since it opened and haven't regretted a single visit... Their pastries, cakes, donuts, chocolate, patties, mini pizzas, sandwiches, Chicken rolls everything has been a part of my life since my childhood."
1,Don't go with monginis and bake and bite both are same they are selling old stock to us...then today i purchase cake from Red fort cake shop near gaondevi mandir bus stop they are awesome with quality in low price ...owner also a good person he suggest best cake for celebrations almond casata is only 380rs and in cake there are so much almond.
2,"The cake we bought: flavour name - Butterscotch was very soggy and didn't taste very good at all.
It looked and smelled very stale.
We did return the cake in 45 mins and told them the issue.
They were not at all ready to even accept the issue.
A good shop would atleast offer some compensation in return."
5,"It is one of the most prestigious cake shop where one can get a-1 quality cake. Also it has pattice, veg and non veg rolls and other eatables too which makes it best. The chocolate cakes of monginis is the best"
1,"Very rude staff. I went to buy a cake. The lady staff  Denied 2000rs note saying our boss has asked to take only change...  and we are not accepting 2000rs note.  also our boss is out of town.. there is no 1 to deposit the money it in the bank.  No notice is put on the shop about the currency.
She  was also Ok not buying cake from the shop. Accepting the shop owner loss.
Todays date is 14 June 2023. Still long way  for 2000rs to be discontinued."
4,I have been ordering from this place for last 8 years food is great service is good & ambience is average. Butter chicken is a must try .
5,"Chicken Tandoori is awesome.
Chicken Biryani is also very tasty.
Veg Biryani is also equally good."
1,Pathetic taste and quality. Left more than half and ate outside
3,"The restaurant has been around for more than 10 years. For dine in, the restaurant is not populated and you can easily have a table in AC or non AC section.
Majority of restaurant orders are online for home delivery.
Food taste is good for Chinese dishes, wonton soup, manchow soup are one of the best i tasted here. From Mughlai dishes, tandoori chicken tastes the best.
Moderately priced and clean place."
4,Good food. Specially Chinese non veg. Do not expect embience and excellence.
4,"Nice banquet for Small functions like family functions or corporate events also.
Food is very good they serve even non veg which is a plus point. Overall staff also good service is also good. And Decore music and lights were proper."
5,"Good place in Borivali for corporate functions and family parties.
Visited this place for one corporate function.
Event was well organised.
Adequate vallet parking.
Neat and clean place.
Adequate hospitality staff.
Food was good, loved non-veg items.
Music was superb.."
5,"Wonderful place, good food, good service, good decor,polite staff.Had booked the hall on the ground floor for my son's haldi in December.I really as appreciate Mr Khanna for everything he made available.My guests too were happy and enjoyed.The food was made as per our taste and delicious.He was present at our function and made arrangements for what ever we needed .Thank you so much and looking forward to having more function at this place.,"
5,Awesome club with all Possible facilities for Sports and Leisure A true value for money
5,"1st visit, really enjoyed this, food and service excellent!"
1,"Pathetic food, the mutton was raw and not cooked well, literally average taste. The Rotis were very thick. Idk about their Chinese cuisine, Indian cuisine is way too bad. Try it for yourself."
5,"I've been visiting this place for a long time. The food never disappoints , the only thing lacking was ambience, which when I recently visited I found the place fully renovated and I'm sure it is worth visiting to see how they have changed from the old run down lock to a latest look. From resin design tables to comfy seating it has it all.

I'm sure u found me talking only abt the ambience....because the food will never disappoint from all kinds veg/non veg dishes.Indian, Chinese starters."
1,"Cant comment on the food, because it was not served for almost 40 mins and I had to leave.
Had ordered Masala papad which was served soggy after I threathened to leave. Was surprised by the pathetic service.
I asked them to give me the bill for the water I drank I thought they would stop me from leaving and serve the food but realized customer wasn't a priority for them.
Noticed that the ambience looked decent but wish they could serve on a decent plate it was like the plates on some thela.
I hope others don't experience this. But for me this was the first and last time."
1,"Wish I never gave a single star too, the delivery guy took forever to get the food delivered they forgot to even tell their chefs to make it when my order was placed 1 and a half hour back and left me starving. When I called the restaurant to ask for a discount to compensate for the late delivery the man had the audacity to tell me, ""Take the Order Or Leave It"" in a high pitched tone."
1,"Now Very bad in taste
I have ordered Chicken Crispy and Egg Manchurian Rice and Chicken Lollipops
Manchurian gravy was like a watery
And Crispy and Lolly was like eating rubber"
5,"Place is absolutely stunning and colourful.
Has beautifully designed cakez which taste equally good. Service is quick"
1,"While they talk of customer satisfaction they first need to serve quality food.
Extremely disappointed after the first visit here.
We took parcel of Rasmalai pastry to celebrate some occasion which the owner guided us is pretty good.
When we had a bite we noticed that the cake is stale and not a fresh one, with a tangy taste, spoiling our taste bud.
If that wasn't a fresh cake the owner shd not have risked with customers health which they seem to be least bothered."
1,Very stale cakelets n not worth the money.
4,"Nice cake shop! with flower shop outside, so you can buy cake n flowers both at the same time, but separately"
1,"I bought a chicken hotdog from here.
The owner refused even for a small paper bag.
Then, I asked to atleast provide a small ketchup sachet, the owner says you may already have ketchup at home.
Disgusting customer serviceüò°"
4,Small eatery but really tasty and cheap food. The owner uncle has been around since a long time and we often go there for his variety of egg dishes.
5,Home cooked cheap and tasty meals.
5,Well food
5,Testy food is here
5,Awesome taste
5,Sea food was fresh and tasty. I highly recommend this place to locals and anyone from our of town.
5,"It a best place as the atmosphere is too good. It has a outdoor sitting area, on first floor it has a superate smoking area with TV screen. It has space for family, group and even for small events. Do try their fish dishes. I would highly recommend this place do visit"

5,"Epic deals in decent prices !
Definitely üíØ

I've tried several dishes from here, and few have already become my favourite !
They have a great menu, which suits your budget.
Meals in a box they say, and it's truly amazing!

Currently I tried :
üî∫Chicken tikka chur chur : probably the best starters they have! It's a must try

üî∫ Butter chicken box : this is a meal box which comes with in house salad, garlic yoghurt, mint chutney, the slightly sweet chicken curry with rice. It's quite filling, and one box can be shared between 2 persons.

üî∫ Overloaded chicken wrap : I must say, this is the best wrap which they serve! Everyone should try this out....

üî∫ Brownie & choco lava : everyone's favourite desserts of all time ! And the taste is truly amazing ...

The delivery was quick and the food was fresh and warm.
Chicken was cooked to perfection and was hygenic too!

A must try !! üíØ"
4,"Quick service. Great food.
Their chicken sandwich is amazing, the chicken overload meal is large enough to fill two people. The chocolava cake is nice. The chicken tikka wrap is wholesome. Definitely a must try place"
4,"If I want some quick meals without any thought I always order from box8.
It has fixed menu like meals for single, for 2 people, biryani, wraps, sandwich, ice cream, cold drinks, desserts, now new menu added steak meals which has both veg/non veg options.
It allows to customize your meal like instead of rice you can go for paratha, choice in dal/rajma/chole etc.
Always on time.
Comes in nice packing with cutlery.
You can take the meals in the same packing while traveling.
I ordered below items.
Firangi sabz biryani - it was delicious and different as it name says it doesn't have any indian vegetables, it has broccoli, baby corn, mushroom etc
Paneer biryani - it was delicious too it has soft cubes of paneer/cottage cheese.

Curd was complementary.

Above all it always have some discount offers.

Food 4/5
Service 4/5
Value for money 4/5

Thanks for the reading, please like if it helps."
4,"Rajma chawal¬†or rajma rice¬†is a  palatable rajma masala (red kidney beans masala) a thick¬†gravy¬†mixed with rice, a comfort food with combination of carbs and protein basically it's a very popular¬†North Indian¬†dish. We ordered  Dilli vaale rajma chawal box from box8-desi meals, that box contained Rajma chawal, green chutney, with some dahi &  salad,  that meal also had Chocolate Lava Cake ...Rajmas were cooked properly & gravy had that spicy texture the way we craved for.. Chocolate lava was reasonably satisfying after a delightful meal , overall it was an tempting meal for us.

My all time favourite dal makhani crom box8 only.
It tastes so creamy n tasty. Must try
Im ordering dal makhani from 2 3years only from box8 but from different locations
Nallasopara - virar location, Borivali West (dahisar), Kandivali, Santacruz east.
Taste is exact same.
Thankyou box8 for awesome mouth-watering dal makhani"
1,"The bought a cotton candy scoop, the cup says 62gms as net weight. When I opened the cup the quantity seemed very less so i weighed on a kitchen scale, came down to 48gms including the weight of the cup. More than 30% worth of scam"
4,"It's the first time i visited a Baskin Robins outlet. This outlet is located on a busy road yet is quiet and peaceful.

The staff is curtious and knows their products very well. They understand your preferences and make recommendations accordingly.

I went there along with friends so got to taste a variety. Tried their mudpie cake roll, coffee ice cream, roasted almost, belgium chocolate. They were delicious and perfectly sweet."
4,"Blueberry Cheesecake Ice Cream (Home Delivered)
.
It was the best Ice Cream Flavour I've tried of Baskin Robbins.
On a scale of Baskin Robbins, it would've gotten a 5/5
There is pieces and you can literally taste the Blueberry and the Cheesecake in there!
Every bite brought happiness and I would personally recommend this to others as it is actually worth it!
And a flavour to fall forüñ§"
5,The outlet is neat and clean. The staff is good. We had a mango in chocolate waffle cone and naughty Nutella. Both were very tasty and excellent. The chocolate waffle cones were over but the staff specially made some fresh ones for us ! We had a good experience at the outlet

5,"Fresh, hot, crispy, flavourful and pocket friendly. This MFC outlet turned out to be a perfect place to satiate ur fried chicken calls. The seasoning and marination was infused deep in the chicken making it a blissful till the last bite..

For sure visiting again.. ü§òü§ò"
4,"Decent food for reasonable price.
Ordered combo of chicken wrap and mini burger.
It was good"
3,I ordered chicken hot wings and Chicken lolipop quality is really good. Taste wise chicken lolipop was much better. But quantity is nothing. Price wise quantity was way too much. I used gold delivery so it was ok deal for me else I was robbed. Not value for money.
4,Nice food ... its not just similar to kfc but better than that ... must try !!
4,"Ordered a spicy fish burger meal (Includes the burger, fries and a small coke bottle). The spicy fish burger was awesome and we really recommend trying it. They do have a chicken variant in it too. We love ordering burgers from this place mainly due to the spicy sauce they use, it has a unique flavour. The fries were okay, nothing to brag about. The meal may not be filing for some so do consider ordering for another burger if you have a big appetite :) :D"
4,"Mojo pizza is a long delivery chain serving all over Mumbai. It's my all time favourite as they have the speciality of serving 10"" pizzas. Also the appetizers they have in the menu are total VFM.
The spicy paneer pizza and the Tex Mex are my all time good to go choices.
The best they have is the GARLIC BREAD STICKS WITH CHEESY DIP & CHOCOLAVA CAKE ."
5,"Recently we ordered from this place. Personally I love mojo pizzas. They serve some amazing pizza with 2x toppings.

We tried

‚ò∏  Cheesy Garlic Bread
It was loaded with cheese.Soft fluffy and fresh. Loved the quality of the bread and cheese. It was delicious in taste.

‚ò∏ Paneer Tikka Pan Pizza
Pizza was filled with toppings. It was loaded with Paneer, capsicum, tomato, onion and cheese.Paneer tikka added that extra touch to this pizza. Perfectly baked cheesy Pizza. It tasted awesome.This one will satisfy all your pizza cravings.

‚ò∏ Chicken Full Smash Cheesy Blast Pizza
It had generous amount of Chicken tikka, roast chicken,kebab, olives, capsicum, onion and peprika.A bit spicy but very delicious. It was delectable and scrumptious.
Delivery was on time. Everything was piping hot."
3,The pizza served here is average to taste. The toppings were in good quantity but the delivery takes time hence the crust of the pizza becomes little hard.
1,"Ordered for delivery, ordered at 9pm and waited till 10:30pm just to know, restaurant is not accepting any phone calls. So unprofessional service. Doesnt have courtesy to call and inform also.  Zero ratings."
4,One of the best i ever ate... I‚Äôll placed this Pizza Hut after the joey‚Äôs pizza...pizza was really good.. I ordered a veg supreme with extra chees burst... cheese stuffing was really yumüòã... I enjoyed the pizza...pizza was really good in taste.. it was fresh..worth to eat..approx300 plus for 2 person... you can also order from zomato.. you will get the super discount on this. They don‚Äôt provide the place to eat...either  we can take at home or somewhere else.
3,"Had so much expectations from this restaurant. Had heard a lott and after zomato reviews and ratings thought that it would be great, but sadly it was not that great. The place is quite small. Has indoor as well as outdoor seating. It has approximately 5-6 tables inside and 3-4 outside.
Interior is well made.. They have very less options in veg category. In North indian they have only laccha paratha, no dal and hardly few curries.
They have set menu as well, which is different for different day. It has two categories, international cuisine and national cuisine.
Had ordered,
-Subz handi, it came with one laccha paratha and pickled onions. The curry and paratha both were too good. Paratha was crisp and the curry was sooo goood..
-Pesto pizza was also good, very thin crusted pizza with good toppings and cheese.
-Lasagna was extremely disappointing. The quantity was so less and also it had no taste and also no cheese. It could have been better.
One more drawback was very less options in A la carte."
4,"This place is attractive inner interior is awesome and the out dinning would be interesting in night. You can enjoy there different different varieties of Indian food and foreign food, the best and amazing thing about them is that the menu keeps changes in 15 days, so likely you can have various types food which is very tasty, Also try there mocktails. There new sandwiches which are simply yummy and it's for limited time like (7am - 7pm).
Quantity and quality 5/5
Costing wise 4.5/5
Service 5/5
Overall rate 5/5
Make sure that you will visit it once"
5,"At Mondo, food is not just about taste its about tantalizing your senses to get an ultimate experience. From the movement you enter the restaurant in this northern end of the city its all about the flow, the experience.
The concept is that of a fixed set menu from indian and global and veg/nonveg. You have a pick and let the chef surprise you.
The presentation, the service the ambience and of course the food, are all just amazing. The server's explain you the course of menu and take you on a culinary journey par excellence. The appetizers, the mocktails, salads, soups were super tasty and perfectly executed. The main course was a little let down but the desserts managed to finish on a high note.
Will definitely love to visit again!!"
5,"Really amazing concept of bringing new dishes one Indian (from different states) and one international every 15 days. With a full 6 course meal, ambiance and great service (quick service). Plating and taste both are awesome. With amazing deserts... loved this place will definitely visit again.
One advice to visitors please book your table in advance. Good place to be with partner family."
4,"Good place. Went for set meal. Friendly staff. Good place to celebrate special occasion.
Ambiance : Not very specious but good enough to sit at ease. Dim lights no music promotes more on conversation.
Food : It was good but Not something which can make me come again. Great presentation can improve more for indian taste.
Overall good experience. +1 for the staff."
1,"If you want to go and see a perfect example of how not to behave with customer then you should visit this place. We went to this place at 11.45 PM. I understand that this is a bit late and they might not have much stock left. We took 5 minutes to decide what to order and when I went for order the sales guy said that for take away order you will have to wait outside. When I asked why is that he did not say anything. Note that there were couple of families sitting there and eating. And there was seating available. Stil this sales guy said you will have to wait outside.

If you don't want to sell waffle to customers then you should stick board on shop that if you are ordering takeaway then you dont have any right to stand inside shop. Then don't even accept the takeaway order inside shop.

I hope this review reaches the owner"
5,"A waffle lover‚Äôs paradise!

I have been to this belgian waffle outlet near my house several times and I can‚Äôt get enough of their waffles. They have a cozy and clean place with friendly staff and quick service. The prices are reasonable and the portions are generous.

They have a variety of waffles to choose from, both sweet and savory. My favorite is the dark chocolate waffle. It is so decadent and satisfying. The waffle is crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, and the chocolate sauce is rich and smooth.

Must visit for waffle lovers. üòç"
4,"Loved their blueberry cream cheese mini pan cakes they were just heavenly.
Also liked the Snickers mini pan cake it has sweet and salty taste with peanut butter.
Must try ice cream waffle it was very tasty.
The place is very clean and offers no contact delivery, accept Digital payments.
Offer takeaway and delivery service.
The staff is very courteous and polite.
Limited place for seating available.
Enterance is not accessible ‚ôø‚ùå"
5,"Belgian waffles the name says it all. They have the best waffles in town. I am so much in love with waffles here that I visit the outlet as well as I order them at home often. The best part is they are pocket friendly. This has become now an addictive treat. The outlet is very small and ambience is just wow with the smell of freshly baked waffles all the time. Red velvet, double chocolate, oreo, Nutella many more too many varieties to explore."
1,"I‚Äôve visited this outlet multiple times.
But from past two visits my experience is not good. The main sales guy think himself very smart & today i.e on 14th feb 2025 I visited my family (10 ppls) and the same guy abruptly said that we can not take orders as there is no stock left.
Even I pointed him that you have enough stock in the kitchen & he said that‚Äôs for online orders & he further said that we will have to wait for one hour & if the stock is not over then they will serve us!
That‚Äôs the attitude that guy has towards customers!

I think this was our last visit & henceforth we are not going to visit this particular outlet."
4,"Recently visited Nischita Family Restaurant and tried their Boti Chicken Masala (boneless) with Tandoori Roti and Buttermilk. The chicken pieces were perfect for bite-sized rotis‚Äîjuicy, tender, and cooked to perfection. The flavors were well-balanced, making it a satisfying meal. The buttermilk added a refreshing touch to the meal. Overall, a great experience for those looking for delicious, well-cooked non-veg options!"
5,"Nischita Hotel holds a special place in my heart, as I've been coming here since childhood. It's a budget-friendly spot ideal for family and friends to enjoy dinner. My personal favorite is their delicious Tandoori Chicken, which always brings me back. The food quality is top-notch, but the staff can be a bit inattentive at times, possibly due to being busy with other tasks. The only downside is the challenging parking situation. Overall, Nischita Hotel is a great choice for a satisfying meal with loved ones."
5,"Looks great after the renovation! Until December the place looked shabby and dirty; they have really made a great effort. We also spoke with the owner and now they have changed the management. The food is really delicious, crowd is better than earlier. Place is much brighter and feels safe for a woman!"
1,Pathetic test of Chicken Pulav. Absolutely not upto the mark. This management is considering the original taste of the restaurant. No value for money. The earlier management was good and food quality was best.
1,"I had a terrible experience. Despite ordering a vegetarian dish, I was served a non-vegetarian dish instead. This gross negligence is unacceptable and reflects poorly on the establishment's professionalism and attention to customer requests. I felt disrespected and disappointed by this blatant disregard for my dietary preferences."
1,"Average se below Burger with old and dirty lettuce üò≠ We asked them to change the lettuce and instead he just put two more slices of cheese to hide the dirty lettuce. To top that i had asked for Paneer Burger and they served Veggie Burger.

The quantity of fries was extremely less and tasted bad. We ordered Peri Peri fries but they did not have Peri peri.

The Spinach and Mushroom Pizza plus Coffee was also below average.

Although their Garlic Bread and Chai was good.

Places to avoid : Crust and Buns, Dahisarüò≠"
5,"Yummyyyy delicious Pizza, Small Samosa and yummy Burgers!
Apart from the deliciousness, even their service is prompt and excellent- right from understanding your requirements to executing it well and delivering it on time- everything was perfect to the table, also at a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend them! Thankyou‚ù§Ô∏è
I loved it alot. All must take the experience of delicious taste."

5,"I visited this place on Saturday. The food was delicious, I loved the pizza, its base was handmade and loaded with lots of cheese and ample chicken toppings. The sandwich was good too, it was loaded with veggies. I also tried white sauce pasta it was creamy and mouthwatering. Chicken rolls were crunchy from the outside and soft and tender from inside. I loved this place and cant wait to visit again ‚ù§"
5,"Recently visited this place.

So  I had tried :

Butter chicken pizza
Garlic bread
Fries
Chicken keema burger

All the items were amazing. They also serves veg items. A must visit place. RecommendedüíØ"
5,"I've been visiting The Fusion Kitchen since 2015, and it never disappoints. The food is consistently amazing, the ambience is inviting, and the service is top-notch. Their signature Flower Dessert Pot is a personal favorite‚ÄîI find myself coming back for it every three months"
3,"Reached here around 6.30 pm.. Inquired for happy hours but was informed that it ends at 7pm...so placed orders for beer ...had asked to get the beer first , but the beer was deliberately brought late to the table time and again to cross the happy hours. Even the second time on addressing this to the server was informed that the service personnel on the upper floor was new and beer was being dispatched from the dispenser...what rubbish reasoning , we asked for the pint to be brought to the table just like other restaurants do but they were refusing to do so...there were mosquitoes in the resturant which kept on bitting us at the table...there was a hostess at the entrance who was just making faces when we had queries . The food was just fine , nothing that great , the veggies on the chicken had no seasoning but just served for the sake of it...music was being played and stopped a million times...the restroom had a leak issue in the urinal wherein everything was seeping down to the foot from the urinal pipe which was disgusting.
The management has either taken their guest for granted or are not bothered.."
4,"The Fusion Kitchen ‚Äì Multiple Cuisines, One Place

I visited this place with my wife, and I must say the ambiance is simple yet decent. No over-the-top d√©cor, just a cosy and comfortable setup. If you're looking for a fancy date night spot, this might not be the place, but if you prefer a casual, relaxed dining experience, this is one of the perfect spots in Borivali. ‚≠ê 4/5

Menu:
Loved the menu presentation! It‚Äôs simple but impactful, with images of dishes, so you know exactly what to expect. A great touch that more restaurants should adopt. ‚≠ê 5/5

Food:
The food is nice but slightly overpriced for the taste and portion size. However, the variety is impressive‚Äîfrom Chinese to Italian to Indian, they offer a good mix. A little refinement in flavors could take it to the next level. ‚≠ê 3.4/5

Service:
No complaints here. The service was good, efficient, and without any major issues. ‚≠ê 4/5

Final Rating: ‚≠ê 4/5

A great place for a casual meal with multiple cuisine options under one roof. Worth a visit, especially for the variety, but could use slight improvements in food pricing and portions."
4,"Had a wonderful time at the cosy Fusion Kitchen! Two Chicken sizzlers, the Mexican and Shaslik, the quantity was easily enough for 4 people with large appetites! Good ol' fish n chips didn't disappoint either! The prawns starter was a good bite too!!"
5,Had a great dinner at TFK a few days back ! Today I saw the pics I had clicked and it reminded me of the good time and so I am posting this review. I liked thier concept of having a limited menu and so the food was fresh and  service was amazingly fast. The food was delicious and we loved the Tiramisu and ordered it twice :) Highly recommended.
5,"I visited Ando ki Taazgi.
Tried Egg Ghotala and Egg Omelette.
Both dishes were tasty.
The quantity was good for the price.
Parking space is ample.
The place is clean and well-maintained.
Service was good.
Overall, a great place for egg dishes.
Recommended for foodies.
Good value for money."
5,Must try to egg lover. There is so much variety on the menu..the place is open until late and there is good space outside to park vehicle. Hygienic and friendly staff.
4,"Best place for Egglovers. This place has variety of menu which might satisfy all your egg cravings. Their famous dish is egg ghotala,  lip-smacking delicious dish topped with cheese served with extra plate of salad and pav soaked in butter. We also friend yummy and spicy green ghotala. Munna bhai is friendly and interactive with guests and the way he makes the dish is amazing.
Reasonable price for good portion of food.
I'd recommend going here over again and again.üòãüòã"
4,Normal meagre dhaba style restaurant. Dont try veg options. On Egg items awesome. Their butter milk is very good. Must try.
5,"This place has been serving some kick-ass egg based food for long time in this area. Its pricey but its bang for your buck.

Food: From a basic Half Fry to complicated Ravaya everything is delicious. It‚Äôs cooked by Munna and its a delight to see him cook with a swag. IMO their Egg ghotala is a must try. Its the best from most of the dishes I‚Äôve had here. Expect a lot of oil and cheese(for high end dishes) in your food

Ambience: You have to stand and eat, has ample space to accommodate around 40-50 people.

Cleanliness: Cook and server wear hair nets. Food is prepared in front you so you know what‚Äôs happening. Hand wash soap is provided.

All in all a must try place for egg lovers."
5,"Awesome tandoori this place serves , also tried  their Peri Peri chicken with Burnt garlic rice ... It was simply delicious with crisp garlic naan

Good friendly staff. Also Served us Complimentary fry noodles twice :)

A must visit place for casual dining with your pals."
3,"Ordered a take away from The Movable Feast today. The order was delivered before time. Service was great.

I ordered- The Movable Feast special chicken pot rice which is a plain flavoured rice with a gravy with broccoli, bell peppers and chicken. More of like a Thai prep. More on the sweeter side. 4/5 Whereas the other dish I ordered was kabab gravy. Something about the preparation of the gravy was amiss. 2/5"
4,Small and sweet place to have your meal. i tried chinese here and it is really very good. Surely will recommend you for chinese food. Nice place over all but would prefer home delivery. They sometimes play music and it feels good. Nice staff and food quality & quantity is ok... chinese lovers must try out!
4,"Good food, breakfast menu like none in the area. Cozy place."
5,"This is a superb takeaway place for Indian and Chinese food. Loved everything that I've tried here. Non greasy, clean and good portion sizes!
Try their burnt Chilly/garlic rice/noodles. Hakka noodles, Triple Schezwan fried rice, Chilly chicken dry, Butter garlic prawns, Kung Pao Chicken, Egg fried rice and Tandoori chicken.
(sorry, no photos here - got busy gobbling up the food!)
Hoping they'll maintain this quality and price ;)"
5,"Awesome Malvani Cuisine if I would describe in one line. To start with it is not like a regular restaurant, it is a family run restaurant, where you can expect home style cooked food. I ordered seafood that is delicacy, and it was amazing in taste."
1,"I really don‚Äôt know what went wrong with Mumma‚Äôs kitchen. About 4-5 years back they served the best authentic maharashtrian food. Today, they serve sub-quality chicken, rice and wafer thin chapatis. Small quantity and high prices. Food doesn‚Äôt taste good anymore. Very disappointed with downfall of this place, wish they get back to their old standards"
5,"Very nice place for the fish lovers. Speciality is malvani cuisine.. we had Prawns Koliwada, Malvani kaleji masala which was so awesome and tasty. Fish is also fresh and well cooked.  Staffs are cooperative and friendly. UPI and Cash payments are accepted."
5,"Very good food, the area is well hygiened, as in the dish dishes the fishes  are served fresh, really I am having a good experience with them."
1,Totally rubbish stale food served and portion is very less.  They are robbing customers.  Waste of money.
3,"Ambiance: The dine in place at this outlet is limited. Just a couple of tables and chairs.

Service: We ordered in a couple of pizza to suffice the group and they did take a lot longer to come. So the service is a little bit slow and definitely can be improved.

Food: The pizzas were ok. Thick bases more chewy. Taste was deccent."
4,One of the best Pizza restaurants in Borivali. The quality and taste of the pizza have always lived up to the expectation. I guess for my last order they might have been busy not that the pizza was not good just the pepperoni was just placed in stacks it would have been better if it was spread on the pizza. Overall experience is always great üëç.
4,"Smokin joes is always a great place to have pizza. They serve delicious triple cheese fantasy base. The outlet is very small to sit and have so better to order or take out.
The zesty paneer pizza was super yum. The topping were sufficient and also the cheese. The triple cheese just melts in the mouth..
The delivery was quick and the pizzas were hot when arrived.."
5,"Pizza are really cool at this place.. pizza base is really soft..

I cheesy chicken pizza are awesome in taste with ample amount of cheese and toppings..

Interior is well maintained and decorated and the service is very nice...

They also have variety of sandwiches though pizza is specially here.."
3,The place is quite small. The pizzas are okay with good quantity of toppings but the base and the could be better. Also there isn't any cheese crust option.
5,best shop in i c conloy
5,Nice Food
5,Best shop
5,Super
5,Good service
5,Food quality and taste was superb.
1,"You order a food and after one hour they will realize delivery can not be made to place where they have already served in past.

No care for customer by giving such a vague answer."
1,Food and service of this restaurant is very bad and pathetic. This restaurant takes almost an hour to deliver food just 200-300 meteres away from restaurant.
3,It will take so much time to give takeaway no extra sev and sezwan give don't accept
4,"This small restaurant is a good option for people who are Chinese food lovers and prefer pure veg hotels as well, which is a rare combination. I frequently order food from this hotel."
5,"Had a fantastic dining experience at Zaika Fun Dining! The ambiance is elegant, the service is top-notch, and the food is absolutely delicious. Every dish was full of flavor and beautifully presented. The staff was courteous and made sure we had a great time. Whether you're visiting with family or friends, this place is a must-try for a delightful meal. Highly recommended!"
5,"Zaika Fun Dining is located on the 1st floor of Club Aquaria Borivali West.

The restaurant is spacious with 2 sections. First being a huge dining setup primarily for families and second with a decent size bar. The ambiance is nice due to big glass windows and the use of a lot of white colour makes the entire setup beautiful.

They specialise in multi cuisine and right now they have added a limited edition 15th Anniversary special menu too. Overall loved the options as they have covered a wide range of cuisines. Prices are not high and the quantity served is perfect.

Went here for a weekday lunch and the kitchen service was amazing and table service by staff Om was excellent as he knew the menu well and he was polite plus attentive.

What We Had -
APPETISERS~
Thyme & Mushroom Vol au Vents -
Mushrooms and cheese mix filled in flaky phyllo pastry tasted outstanding. Loved the earthy flavours of the mushrooms and flaky base was excellent.

Chicken Tikka Skewers -
Mix of malai, red tikka and green tikka served on skewers tasted perfect. Loved the grilling as the chicken was flavourful with the juiciness intact.

MAINS~
Phaldari Kofta Korma Gravy -
A unique gravy based with light spinach and nut filled paneer kofta. Loved the thick texture and taste wise it didn‚Äôt had strong flavour hence tasted really good.

Veg Nasi Goreng -
This is their version of Nasi Goreng presented in a vegetarian style which tasted decent. Gravy, rice and exotic veggies skewer and fried noodles tasted good together. The gravy was schezwan based and overall it was a nice filling dish.

DESSERT~
Nutella Pull Me Up -
Mousse based chocolate cake topped with Nutella Cream tasted nice. Would have loved if this had more of hazelnuts in this.

MOCKTAILS~
Beware of the Coconut.
Smokey Lagoon.
They are experts in presentation of mocktails and they excelled in taste as well.

So our lunch at Zaika Fun Dining Borivali was really good as we enjoyed all the food we ate, the service was on time and the staff here is attentive. Therefore a must visit."
4,"I visited this place on 31st eve for a family dine out and I was totally satisfied with their hygiene, hospitality, food taste in terms of quality n quantity both and they are definitely aesthetic !
They have good line of offerings in foods.
Definitely must place to visit for making memories."
3,"Food was very very average. We ordered two mocktails, love potion ( very basic litchi drink) , pinacolado(overpowered with vanilla), lotus stem appetizer - decent enough, like lotus stem in paneer chilli gravy. Paneer sizzler, very basic, it lacked flavour, fries were good. Service was fast."
2,"We had planned a lunch outing with our office team at Zaika Fun Dining | Club Aquaria restaurant, where we selected the unlimited buffet. It was a Friday, and the menu for the day included Tomato Dhaniya Shorba soup, which tasted absolutely awful. It had a strange flavor, similar to sambhar, and was the worst dish. Next, the spring rolls as starters were really tasty. However, the Paneer Pahadi was completely tasteless. Moving on to the main course, there were two vegetable dishes‚ÄîPaneer and Palak‚Äîwhich were also bland. The two types of bread‚ÄîTandoori Roti and Naan‚Äîwere good. For desserts, we had ice cream and Gulab Jamun, which were both decent. But the service was not good at all. While two staff members were polite and humble, the rest of them behaved oddly. On a positive note, the ambience of Zaika was really nice."
5,Good food and service. Sitting ambience  is also good. Try if you want silence for eating and drinking.
5,Less crowd silent food is nice. Best bar to chillax
4,Nice joint good food reasonable rates
5,Cheap than others plus unlimited free snacks
3,Good place for friends ....not for family.
3,Decent food. Nothing else really. Barely any restaurants around in any case.
3,Beers doesn't make any harm
2,Dnt go if ur below 25.
4,Superb items available
3,Not so good
3,The place is generally for alcohol drinks along with some delicious non vegetarian items. Chinese items are good here along with some of the Indian starters. But the main attraction of this place is alcohol drinks.
1,"Poor service ,
Food quality is very bad
Food is very expensive as per quality"
4,Nice place for a quick lunch or dinner. Not family friendly. Ambience is okay. Food is good. Service is a bit slow.
1,Crooks never buy from this restaurant I ordered Bombil Fry they sent me 5 tiny half bombil pieces.  Robbers
5,Prawns Biryani has nice aroma... unlike other places which is just spicy
5,"Visited Belgian Waffle last night and tried the Belgium milk chocolate and butterscotch crunch waffles. Both were exceptional! Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside‚Äîthese are hands down the best waffles I've ever had. If you love waffles, this place is a must-visit!"
5,"Tried the 2 layered death by chocolate cake and it was too yummy and satisfying.
The staff is also very co-operative and service too was very fast...!!!
The Belgian waffle company never fails to satisfies the demands of its customers!!!!"
4,The outlet is super beautiful . The way they have put up menu is so creative. The waffles size is amazing bigger than most of the waffles I had before . The day n night waffle was super amazing the chocolate added was apt. The blue berry cheese waffle was again amazing completely loaded with blueberry. The guy who servers u here is super sweet sorry I forgot your nameüòÖ. This one is highly recommended for all waffle lovers‚ù§Ô∏è
4,"Belgian waffle is basically a desserts shop with waffles and pancakes based on chocolate. The also provide shakes. Unlike any other outlet of belgian waffle you won't be disappointed with the dessert's. The area is very small can accommodate five people at max.
Also we went at an offer day where all waffle and pancakes were at Rs.100/-
The dishes we ordered were:

1)Triple chocolate overload
As the name suggests there are three types of chocolate in this which turns out to be super sweet and delicious .

2)Chocolate Overload (Selected dark chocolate)
As i love dark chocolate i ordered the same and got as i expected. A waffle with hot dark chocolate across it .
My ratings:
Food 4/5
Staff Behaviour 4/5
Ambience 3/5
Worth the buck 4/5"
4,"Ambiance was not so good
There are no sitting area or waiting area
But Staff was good
Slow service ,
Good taste of waffles here
Also shakes and pancake available .
Recommend to visit at evening times because it has low rush . Should visit with friends and family."
5,Biryani and Butter Chicken was tooo Awesome...!! Rated 5* as the quantiy and quality was really good. Above expectation that at night time.
5,Nice food & nice service
5,Good ambience loved it
4,"Great taste,  good food"
4,Not bad :)
3,"We ordered a burger, coffee and pizza puff. Seats weren‚Äôt clean, burger was dry the sauce was barely there, pizza puff was not hot and half cooked. Hand dryer was extremely dirty. Staff was friendly."
2,"Not a good outlet!
The service is very poor, the staff is also not trained.
Their dessert and soft drink machines don't work.
Don't buy meals as they do not have any soft drink they will just offer cooler with additional cost to the meal cost without adjusting the price for beverage.
Make sure to check your order before payment as the staff will put different meal size without asking.
The food was fine.
Good seating space available.
They have 1st floor seating area for birthday party and groups.
Parking space available.
The entrance is not accessible ‚ôø‚ùå"
1,Zero star rating deserves we have order overloaded Chocolate Mc Flurry and after waiting for 1:30 mins we are getting wrong product delivery for brownie with hot fudge very poor service and just because of this we waited for another longer time to get another order.
1,"Staff was trying but sub par food, staff and service. Their cold drink machine was broken and their soft serve machine too. The staff didn‚Äôt compliment the other drinks when you get the meal. You need to pay additional for it even though the machine being out of service is their fault."
1,"My experience was disappointing from the start at the ordering counter where the cashier was having lack of knowledge and did not know her product what se is selling.
Secondly the Air conditioning wasn't cool enough which made my experience even worse.
I did not like the burger meal"
4,The vibe is great and music too. Dishes are tasty but the biggest problem is the service. They take‚Äôs a lot of time for cooking and food comes very late. One star removed because of the late service. I would love to recommend the virgin pina colada mocktail. The taste is really awesome. Perfect balance of flavours.
5,"Excellent Service by Ramesh!

I had a wonderful dining experience, thanks to Ramzza and Khurshid exceptional service. He was incredibly friendly, attentive, and polite throughout our visit. From the moment we were seated, he made sure we were comfortable and well taken care of. He provided great recommendations, checked on us regularly without being intrusive, and ensured we had everything we needed. His warm and professional attitude truly enhanced our meal.

Highly recommend visiting this restaurant and asking for Ramezza and Khurshid ‚Äîyou won‚Äôt be disappointed!

Would you like me to adjust anything?"
5,"Best party place in Dahisar!
This place has a chill and happening vibe, with amazing music and good food.

It is located in Thakur Mall near Dahisar Check naka. TBC is surely a vibing place to chill, party and enjoy the special moments.

I visited here with my friends and we had an awesome evening. Everything was just so perfect. We enjoyed the yummy dishes along with foot tapping music. The ambience here is so cool and decent, it sets up your mood right.

Service was prompt and on time. Seating arrangements are well inside. They also have live music nights on several days. Taste and quality of food and drinks made the eve even much more better.

A must visit place with your friends, family and close ones! Cheers!"
5,"The most Happening place ..... the food....the ambience.... the service is just amazing. It's a great place for any kind of celebrations or get together.  They also have live music where the folks singing were totally outstanding with a good choice of songs complimenting their great voice.

Must Go place with Family , friends and loved ones..."
2,"Boat Club Restaurant Miraroad

Unfortunately, my recent experience at Boat Club Restaurant was disappointing. We ordered two seafood starters Bombil (Bombay Duck) and prawns and both were far from fresh. The fish had a noticeable, unpleasant odor that was off-putting, suggesting it wasn‚Äôt properly stored or handled. The prawns were also less than ideal, with a noticeable fishy smell that raised concerns about their freshness and hygiene.

In terms of food quality, freshness is paramount, especially when it comes to seafood, and this restaurant missed the mark. It was surprising given the reputation, and I hope they take better care in sourcing and preparing their ingredients. Until then, I can‚Äôt recommend their seafood dishes."
3,Good quality and quantity of food for the price and style of restaurant.  We tired their tandoori platter and 2 types of soup. Simple small seating space and they offer lots of food options
1,The staff is extremely incompetent! The entire restaurant had one big table and I was on the other table yet the manager was having a tough time coping. I ordered a masala dosa and manchow soup and made me wait for 30 mins at least. Don‚Äôt bother with this place unless you want to sit there and watch your hunger die. Also found a strand of hair in my dosa
4,This restaurant is located in Borivali West just near to Thakrey Prabodhan auditorium. Food was good. We had pav bhaji it was yumm. Rawa masala dosa was nice but quantity of Aloo masala was too much. Idli chilli dry was average as it was so hard. Paneer frankie was not at all good. I felt the frankies served on the street are much better than this. Service and ambience was ok. Sitting area is spacious.
3,"Recently I visited this restaurant with high expectations owing to the hype that was around Street Gourmet but unfortunately I had a very mediocre experience.

I visited on a Sunday evening so I had to wait for almost half an hour to get a table. The service is prompt, the order didn't take long to be served.

Coming to the food, I had ordered :
Arabia paneer tikka masala - This dish was nice. It had a distinctive taste which separates it from a regular Paneer Tikka Masala. Worth a try.

Manchurian Noodles - This dish was just about average, nothing special about it. I was expecting something with a distinctive taste which could define their style of cooking but it was very similar to any manchurian noodles you eat at fast food joints.

Overall. I would say that Street Gourmet's Indian Cuisine food is better than the Chinese one. The place has a great ambience. The decor is themed after Street Food. Customer service is great. Do give it a try for Indian food."
5,"The best fine dine place with very reasonable rate. The place where you can take your family and have a great meal. This place is situated nearby to borivali station. No issues in travelling. It does not look like a normal Restaurant. Its much more better.
Talking about the ambience, the place does not have much of decorations. Sometimes simple and sober is also Amazing. This is quite a great place for the people who love proper indian food. This restaurant mostly serves indian food but also consists of Chinese, Mexican food dishes.

The things we tried :

1. MOCKTAILS üç∑

¬∑ Blue Heaven
It was beautifully Decorated. It consists of Blue Curacao Syrup, Soda and Sprite.

¬∑ Green Apple Mojito
This had an amazing taste of Green apple syrup with soda and sprite.

¬∑ Mint Mojito
It had a green lime syrup with podina soda and Sprite.

¬∑ Kiwi Grasshopper
The Name is Amazing and it consists of Kiwi syrup juice with lime soda and Sprite.

2. CHAAT üåØ

¬∑ Dahi Potato Puri
It was the basic dahi puri with the topping of Pomegranate which was delicious ‚ù§

3. PAV BHAJI üçû

¬∑ Special Pav Bhaji
This was the special pav bhaji of Street Gourment. It was a mixture of all types of Bhaji's . It further includes dry fruits and cheese at the top üòã

¬∑ Pav Sandwich
It was the pav with delicious Spicy Masala and the taste was Mindblowing üòò

4. CHINESE STARTERS üçú

¬∑ Paneer Crispy
This looked like it was very spicy but it was compensated with a bit Sweetness.

¬∑ Paneer Chilli Dry
This was not upto my expectation level. I would rate this dish lower.

5. INDIAN STARTERS ü•ò
Basically I would not recommend this, not because it was not good. Only Kabab will love this.

6. CHINESE MAINS ü•ó

¬∑ Chinese Chopsuey
This was basically a SaladüòÇ . Better have salad than having a chopsuey.

7. MILKSHAKES ü•õ

¬∑ Chickoo Chocolate
Chickoo lovers go for it. Nothing new in this. Just the fruit changes and chocolate remains the same !üòõ

8. FALOODA ü•É

¬∑ Royal Falooda
It just the basic Rose falooda and nothing new ingrediant.

Overall, we had great experience. If talking about the ratings
Here are the following :

FOOD : 3.5/5
AMBIENCE : 4/5
SERVICE : 3.5/5
VALUE OF MONEY : 5/5

I would recommend this to try once üòÅ"
4,"At this place you will get veg, non veg but this place has also got thali they have got lots of varieties also I made a review video about this place do check on YouTube :- HEPERFECT FOOD VLOGGER"
5,"amazing variety of products available. The best part is that the cloth quality is AMAZING. a small suggestion increase the size of the place as it is always very crowded no matter weekday or weekend.

AT THE END, SATISFIED WITH THE CLOTHES, ALL LATEST COLLECTIONS AND THE MANAGEMENT is nice.

Thank you Fashmerize. ‚ô•"

4,"The burger is great, the Oreo milk shake is very good."
4,"Good food, moderate atmosphere, moderate service.

Best place for a quick bite which serves fast food like burgers, wraps, soft drinks etc.
The burgers here are tasty and affordable.
Aloo wrap is tasty too.
In the picture : Crispy veg jumboking and Nacho jumboking"
1,Ordered 6 burgers via swiggy and received only 4. Now they won't even give me the 2 burgers they missed and neither the refund money back to my original payment method.
5,"The Biryani is awesome and tasty. The tandoori leg is also very good. There are many fried items which are also good in taste. The prices of Biryani, tandoori leg and fried items are reasonable and affordable. They also provide biryani  as well as other items for functions, parties and many events. It is worth the price. A good place to take parcel. Taking parcel from this place since 2008 and everytime the food experience is best."
5,"I can term this place as a delivery outlet.
Biryani is very tasty. They have variants of kebabs and juicy chicken starters.
Try Mutton seekh kebabs.
One can prefer to have it home delivered by food partners like zomato and swiggy."
1,"Worst biryani I ever ate!

They served cold, bad tasted biryani with 2 chicken pieces which hardly had any flesh just bone only.

Taste was really very unpleasant and they did not give raita saying it was over nothing left.

Rice was also local rice not at all suitable for biryani. It's particle were thick as if I'm eating khichadi.

Place was unhygienic and overall I would not recommend this third class biryani store. Explore other options but don't buy from here."
1,"After a very long time I had the chicken biryani today and it was really disappointing. hardly 3 chicken pieces given, one was small wing piece no flesh nd other was bone. the biryani was literally dry. Not worth the money.
Very disppointing"
4,"I usually order tandoori, which is quite delicious with their special ingredients.
You can just enjoy evey bite of that tandoori
and most importantly price is much less, if we compare with the other fancy restaurants.
Biriyani is ok, rice quantity and taste is definitely good but I really suggest they work on their chicken pieces which is not satisfying."
5,"Loved it. It's my go to place.. been there 3 times. Be it a special occasion or just a quick meet up with friends.

The kitchen is closed from 4pm to 7pm. Bar is open throughout the time."
1,"Sushwagat hotel (Payyade Group of Hotels) Poonam Sagar, Mira Road, any time you may find cockroaches in the food, there is nothing like the name of hygienic hotel, go to eat with caution and be careful"
1,"Quantity of food is not worth the cost... Really pathetic customer experience

Aglio olio pasta costs 280.but just check the quantity

Chicken shaslik was served cold and looked like made with leftovers

And to top it all with the worst experience check the mouth freshener plate... Looks like this place is made for worst experiences

Go here if u want to spoil ur day"
5,Ambience and food both are superb
4,"Visited with my friend and we had chicken satay which was amazing, we also tried Alfredo pasta which was bland even tho we sprinkled oregano and for drinks we ordered Virgin Pinacolada and Fruit Punch both of these were great in taste.. The ambience was really great as wellüòçThe music was way too loud tho..
Overall I did have a good experience!!"
5,"One of the finest & best possible options anyone can opt for who prefers pure veg (Without onion & garlic) food. This place is located in Iscon Temple, Mira Road and provides quality food & ambience. During our visit in the week days we opted for buffet. It provides 2 different tariffs (It varies) with approx. Rs. 350 - 400 / Weekdays & Rs. 450 - 550 / Weekends depending upon prepared items. A must visit place."
3,"I recently had the pleasure of visiting Govinda‚Äôs Prasadam, located inside the ISKCON temple, and I must say it was an exceptional experience. One of the standout features of this dining experience is that they do not use onions or garlic in their preparations, yet the food is incredibly flavorful and satisfying. This makes it a great option for those following specific dietary restrictions while still enjoying delicious meals.

The atmosphere at Govinda‚Äôs is peaceful and serene, which adds to the overall dining experience. It is an ideal place for families and groups to enjoy a meal together, as the environment is calm and welcoming. The buffet, priced around 450-500 INR, offers a variety of unlimited options, making it a great value for money. The dishes are well-prepared, with a wide array of choices that cater to different tastes and preferences.

Additionally, for those looking for a takeaway option, Govinda‚Äôs offers mini thalis at affordable prices (around 249-299 INR). Despite being a smaller portion, these thalis do not compromise on quality or quantity. The food is still rich in flavor and nutritionally balanced, making it a great option for a wholesome meal on the go.

Overall, my visit to Govinda‚Äôs Prasadam was a delightful experience, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for delicious, healthy, and reasonably priced vegetarian meals in a peaceful setting."
4,Best place to have pure veg satvik meal without onion and Garlic. Divine aura
1,"It's not even worth 1 Star. But have to give as I cannot proceed ahead. Soiled Chairs, Alge inside water bottle, Dirty Plates & Spoons. Very poor Quality of Cutlery. We literally had to choose plates & spoons as many of them were uncleaned. No Service at all. Don't waste Rs 400/- on this Restuarant. Pathetic is the under statement."
3,"Over all the food is okay. But one  critical thing observed they are packing parcel from same buffet  which other guest are having through. This is crucial as it is touched by many and chances are vast that it can get stale fast if packed as it is.

Urgently govindas should observe this and understand it and ensure parcel are packed from kitchen area instead of buffet line.

With regards to taste it is okay okay"
5,"Best Chinese Food in Mira Road
If you're looking for one of the best Chinese restaurants in Mira Road, you must try this place! They offer a fantastic selection of dishes, including pure vegetarian options that cater to all dietary preferences. The service is consistently praised for being attentive and friendly, ensuring a pleasant dining experience. Whether you're in the mood for noodles, dumplings, or a rich stir-fry, this restaurant has something to satisfy your cravings. Don't miss out on this gem for a delightful Chinese meal!"
4,"We visited Indian Spices to try their Chinese dishes and had a delicious experience. We ordered Paneer Chilli, Veg Pot Rice, Chicken Chilli and Chicken Chopper Rice. All the dish was delicious and the quantity was too good compare to other Chinese restaurants. Only downfall is their slow service in bringing the order, rest all their's nothing to complain about. I would recommend Indian Spices if you are craving for Chinese."
4,"It's a nice place to have some quality time.
Food here is the best in Taste & in a good quantity as well. Food makes it better to spend the time with your Friends, family or loved ones.
I suggest it's worth to go there."
1,"The food at Indian Spices restaurant was incredibly disappointing - oily, and clearly made with low quality ingredients. The worst Chinese food I've ever had. The flavors were completely unbalanced and uninspired. Avoid this place at all costs if you're looking for decent Chinese food."
5,We tried some Chinese starters and Momos. Crispy Paneer fried rice was amazing!! Service was good.
3,"Visited this Punjabi restaurant recently and had a good experience overall. The ambiance was warm and welcoming, with a nice touch of Punjabi culture in the decor. The menu had a wide variety of traditional dishes, and the service was friendly and prompt. A decent place to enjoy a comforting North Indian meal with family or friend"
2,"Restaurant is clean and good. Food is ok, waiter is like on your head, asking your order, getting it quick and asking in a hurry for next order and if no, then he is super quick to bring the bill and say.... Time out and please get out. The stare he gave me was like.... Don't sit here for long, eat and go. (FYI there was no waiting, still it was like eat and get out)

I would say, give customer some time to eat and relax."
2,"Home delivery service is a bit on the slower side.
We ordered Greens Special Pizza and were shocked to see this contain pineapple anf apple slices. Who puts fruit in a pizza!
No warning in the form of content was provided on the menu.
Not recommended!"
5,"Visiting Greens was an good experience

1,"The taste is very bad and totally waste of money
Also there is no facility of washroom
Don't go there, we have ordered pav bhaji and paneer pakoda both dishes have bad taste and the paneer not cooked as well.
And quality of food not well according to their prices."
5,I had gone there to purchase a cake for a occasion. And the atmosphere is literally very good. Mr. Hiren was so friendly with me and also suggested me the cake i should buy. I highly recommend you to visit there.
5,New management has been changed and their are very politely with  customer Mr Hiren treat customer as a family.thank u
5,Very tasty snacks . The cakes are very fresh. The burgers and patties are very fresh and yummy. The staff service was very amazing compared to other shops. Would surely recommend this shop
5,One of the best Monginis shop in in around Mira Road and in Poonam Sagar complex services is good product is fresh and even staff is great specially Pravin giving good services and I just had a chocolate ball it was really soft and fresh
5,I always go to Monginis but it was open at 4:00 p.m. now onwards its open from morning good service.
1,Recently I bought two cakes ( rainbow premium and truffle) and they were tasting very bad. It was spoiled!
1,This branch is closed permanently..
5,Staff are very much professional and polite ...rolls and puff are amazing in taste
5,Customised cake - amazing taste.. 5 stars.
4,"The brownie was too yumm, and the place was also good."
4,"So to satisfy my Chinese cravings, I decided to give this place a try. It's nearby Borivali station.

I didn't have much expectation since you know how restaurant Chinese food tastes, as compared to street-style. But the food I ordered was tasty and satisfied my taste buds well.

The timepass fried noodles and Schezwan were really very good‚Äîthe best I would say!

I went with paneer chilly in starters and veg Schezwan noodles. Both of them were tasty and outperformed my expectations. I loved the food.

The food got prepared and served quickly.
The quantity is less compared to the prices. It's a little overpriced, I would say. But the food is tasty. good experience"
1,I ordered 1 full plate of lollypop masala dry. When I received the delivery container was filled with only 5 pieces. After conversation over phone the receptionist denying the case even after sending the photo on WhatsApp.
5,"If you love eggs,this is the right place to satisfy your cravings for eggs and enjoy the most wonderful egg dishes.i was in Borivali for some window shopping.After finish up,I decided to sit and dine somewhere and I noticed this restaurant near flea market.I went there to sit and eat.I had ordered Australian fry,Egg lahori,Lasan Kachu and B/K dry which were nice.Food and service is good.I love the Egg lahori very nice."
4,"Located close to Borivali station, this place has been serving mouthwatering desi chinese for years now. The ambience and decor is average at best, but that is not the thing regular patrons return here for. Their food sells for itself and it is damn yummy.
Quantity is really good here, usually one dish being enough for two people easily. To add to that, their food is at a very reasonable price. Service is prompt and even though the staff are not highly trained, they do get the job done. We had the following to eat :
Chicken Sweet Corn Soup - Large pieces of perfectly cooked chicken in a thick soup consisting of egg and sweet corn, it felt really good in this cold weather.
Triple Chicken Rice - Yummy fried rice served along with spicy schezwan gravy, it was a perfect match. The gravy was absolutely flavourful and filled with chunks of chicken. It gave the rice some much needed support, as the rice on its own was a bit underwhelming. We would recommend this for the gravy itself..üòã"
4,"One the best chinese food I ever had. I tried Kukus chicken fried rice, Kukus chicken soup and Kukus special noodles. The test is awesome. Restaurant is very clean. Staff have very pleasing personality. I had travelled from Pune to just to eat at this place. I marked it one of the best place to have Chinese in Mumbai. This place is very old and they have maintain the same quality. They do home delivery too with partner delivery app. Kukus Chinese Restaurant is one of the best chinese restaurants in Borivali. It has a great menu, but it has a humble space and in between crowded markets."
1,Very bad service by employees and supply cake is experienced and too much surgery don't buy form monginis cake at borivali west delicioua foods monginis cake
1,As per mention till 11 pm shop will be open.. I have reached 10pm but employee has not given the cake. Not a good service
4,"The cake should be cream, soft such taht it melts in..... But the cake was really hard and i felt it was not at all fresh..... Management should work on the quality of cakes and try to make customers experience awesome...... Although this is the first time i experienced such thing...... I hope next time i get a tasty one"
3,"Quality of cakes is poor compared to quality before few years other bakery products like puffs and biscuits are good and pocket friendly. They serve egg cake as well as egg cake.
Puffs and rolls are available in veg and non veg options.
The staff is polite and provides quick service.
Their festival edition tea cakes like plum cake and fruit cake are better than the regular ones."
5,Very Fresh and Hygienic shop.Staff  also very Friendly Deepak Sir and Surabh Sir very helpful nature .must visit if you are nearby. Try pastry and cakes
1,I had ordered a Mumbai burger in that there was hair it's totally unhygienic I told to staff they told me sir it's one bite is remaining only
1,Staff are mannerless not properly trained chappri behaviors should b kept strick Management.  Loudly talking all bullshits dancing on the floor . Very disappointed.
1,"Staff doesn't pays attention to what is been ordered
! Added Onion in jain burger even after instructing not to"
4,"Wide options of Vada pav in a burger form are available, Ideal for quick bites.
They have take away option.
And very little place to stand and eat there.
Usually crowded during evening time but they offer quick service.
Their crispy veg jk, corn palak, regular and butter grilled jk are must try also if you are a fan of wraps try their paneer wrap and crispy veg wrap.
Recently had jk big crunch the patty was crispy outside and soft inside. It had mixed veggies but outer crust was too oily.
Fries were good in quality and quantity.
Their crispy veg wrap is super tasty the veggies inside are crunchy and sauce is perfect."
4,"Good taste. As compared to other burgers, jumbo king burgers are a little bit lower in price. Variety of options available. Delivery and takeaway options are available."
4,"We were really keen to have some pasta for snacks, and we thought of trying the Italiano pasta from here.

The penne pasta was delicious. The white sauce was tasty, and you could feel the cheesy taste with every bite. One good thing the restaurant did was not to add any bell peppers, as we had stated in the special instruction. The corn and black olives added truly enhanced the taste of the pasta.

Also, these guys sent around 3-4 packets of chilli flakes for a single pasta order, which was a good thing. The only thing however we missed was that there was not a single packet of oregano with the parcel despite mentioning the same. But the taste of pasta was authentic, and they made sure that the white sauce was just right in terms of thickness and taste. We definitely found the pasta delicious and liked it very much."
1,"When we ask too much questions for items to be included in Jain food, owner Amir Khan gets irritated and doesn't give proper response"
5,"The Best Place to have Amezing Yummy  Pizza in reasonable price.

Momento is serving Same ( or better)  Quality Food than Pizza Hut and Dominoz.

Also They serve superb Sandwiches and Pasta which should not miss to try.

Simply Supeb Place to visit / Order Pizza and More..."
4,Filling is less in pizza comparatively to other vendors.  Sandwich is nice
1,"Kachra food .avoid..vomited..
Momento all pizza are food poisoning. Police complaints are there against the owner. Like fraud people, they are shifting their shop from place to place. Better switch to Pizza hut or dominos.."
5,"Food Adda has a vibrant and cozy atmosphere, ideal for casual hangouts with my friends..
Food Adda is a great place for foodies looking for delicious meals at reasonable prices.
The large burger, cheese french fries, garlic bread, cheese margherita pizza, and chocolate bowl come highly recommended."

2,"Once upon a time this place was booming. We had to wait to get a place. But now the quality of food is degrading.

This place looks dead now and many times there are no one at this place.

We had ordered onion rings which was little raw from inside. Tea was very very very sweet(like drinking sugar syrup) sandwich was bit better but the taste was not there.

We also ordered lime soda which was thw worst. All the sugar was at the bottom of the bottle. We felt like throwing the lime soda in dustbin.

We wanted to order more but looking at the quality of the food we decided to get out and eat something else.

I request the owners to take a look at the quality."
2,"I went Food Adda because it used to be a popular restaurant back in time and the service was good. I don‚Äôt know what happened. The staff is so arrogant and I ordered pasta rice and pizza. The quality of Food has decorated so badly. I can‚Äôt even imagine I would not suggest you to go and eat unless and until you want to get sick the other day , when I complained it to the restaurant manager, the quality is not up to the mark. He said these of the quality only people like it. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the problem in that and the behaviour was very very bad. So we packed the food and we gave it to be outside because, it is just so pathetic experience"
5,"Nestled in a cosy nook of the city, this cafe is a pleasant find for anybody looking for fresh and flavourful vegetarian food. The menu has an incredible selection of sandwiches, each carefully made and brimming with fresh ingredients and flavour. The mocktails are as refreshing, with the peachy Mojito striking the ideal combination of sweetness and citrus. To round off the meal, the appetisers, particularly the crunchy, cheesy corn balls, are a must-have, providing a delicious crunch with each bite. The environment is warm and friendly, making it an excellent choice for casual meals with friends or relaxing evening snacking. Overall, it is a beautiful place for anybody looking for good vegetarian food in a welcoming atmosphere. Just one thing I can add is their AC was not working properly where we were sitting; hence, we had to change the place"
5,"Amazing Non veg food n sizzlers , perfect ambience, hookah and drinks. This is my second visit, its usually empty but I feel this place needs more promotion."
4,"Good place with good music.. Nice ambience.. It was particularly breezy when i visited, which was adding the icing on the cake. Good to visit in groups.
Sheesha 3.8/5
Food 3.5/5 though its bit expensive..
Drinks 4/5
Tandoori paneer quesadillas is worth a try."

If you are nearby I think you can visit it without any hesitation"
4,"It's a cool place, little less crowded Sheesha currently closed! Only drinks available with nice Ambience, Service is okay!"
5,"While the dosa was a bit crispy, the tea was fantabulous. It reminded me of the Tea I have in my Hometown in Assam. The waiter seemed a bit rude at first but seemed kinda happy when I asked for Tea.
Also, I saw an old couple and recalled about yesterday when a friend of mine was telling about her grandparents and points that's what her couple goals are. The old couple I saw sitting down in the restaurant, they sat facing each other and the old lady was smiling at her husband like they came out on a date. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
5,"Gokul Restaurant, Borivali ‚Äì Loved it! üåü

A vibrant, no-fuss spot serving *insanely delicious* veg food! Their buttery pav bhaji, smoky paneer tikka, and crispy masala dosa are pure bliss. The bustling vibe adds to the charm ‚Äì perfect for a quick, flavorful meal. Affordable, authentic, and utterly satisfying."
2,"No restaurant in Borivali has degraded as much as Gokul. The food quality is pathetic, the facilities are bad. The thali was the only saving grace, even that has been taken out. Only weary bus travellers will get lured by this horrible place."
4,Aah very good restaurant with varities of South Indian dishes. It is situated in a good location not so far from Borivali station.it is also the landmark of many tour and travels agency from where regular buses starts towards the different part of Maharashtra and South India. Overall experience of this restaurant was very good. Staffs are well behaved and customer friendly
4,"Gokul hotel is prime location and landmark place which offers a varieties of south Indian, North Indian dishes. One of the oldest established (50+ years of legacy) Gokul hotel mainly known for tour & travel departure point as it's many offices located  near by .
Ambiance is welcoming and vibrant
I recommending masala Dosa & tea this place also Known Pav Bhaji."
4,"Good place to explore typical Maharashtrian food

Its near by borivali railway station only 900mts

We ordered delicious Puri bhaji , missal pav and hot  vatata vada

I will personally rank it at no.2 I explored traditional food

Service was very nice and fast

Many other options to explore like veg pettice , amras puri , thali in Rs.150 and many more

Less crowded and children friendly

Also while paying our bill explored mysore pak and different types of Shreekhand (fruit ,blackberry , dryfruit etc.)

Must try once"

Requesting you please think on it.üôè
Very disappointed today.

4,"Super delicious authentic maharashtrian food. Authentic taste of all food items, i love misalpav, vada, bhajiya, aluwadi, kothimbir vadi, puranpoli and last but not the least chai n coffee. I don't miss this place whenever I go to Borivali West. The only thing I miss is food gets over by 3, u won't get much items post that."
5,Just amazing. Very homely like food. We were afraid of the spice level and oil. But we were surprised to see such a comforting balanced Thali at such a reasonable price. The Sol kadhi was soulfully refreshing
4,Have been going here since the past 20 years however off late the service has become slow‚Ä¶ chicken sizzler still remains the best item on the menu.
1,"Extremely Dissatisfied with Food Quality & Hygiene ‚Äì Resulted in Food Poisoning

I recently placed an order from your establishment and was deeply disappointed with the experience. The food delivered was stale and clearly unfit for consumption. Shortly after eating, I developed severe food poisoning, which left me ill for two days and forced me to miss work.

This is completely unacceptable, especially from a place that once maintained decent standards. The decline in food quality and hygiene is alarming, and I strongly urge management to address these issues immediately. I will certainly reconsider ordering from here again unless significant improvements are made."
4,"Have been coming here since childhood, great family friendly restaurant!"
5,"I came for dine-in today afternoon. I had chicken banjara kabab, thai curry-rice and the overall food was excellent especially goan fish curry, prawns biryani and surmai tawa fry.

One incident i want to mention:

Wrong item during parcel was given when packing and i noticed it during dinner time. But after calling and explaining the situation to their manager Mr. Nirajan ji, he handled it very professionally and also made sure to deliver the right item on time.This shows how they value their customers.

To sum-up, a must visit place especially if you‚Äôre a sea food lover."
4,"We recently dined at this fine dine restaurant and ordered two Bombil thalis along with one extra Bombil fry plate. We were informed that each thali includes only one piece of fried Bombil, but they served two pieces each.

Unfortunately, the taste and preparation of the fried Bombil were quite disappointing‚Äîit lacked the crispness and flavor you typically expect from a good Malvani restaurant. The Goan fish curry didn‚Äôt meet expectations either, and even the soul curry was below average, lacking depth and authenticity.

For a total bill of ‚Çπ1800/-, the overall experience did not feel worth the price. The food quality didn‚Äôt align with the fine dine positioning or pricing."
5,"Sri Krishna Restaurant at Grant Road is a top-notch veg restaurant in South Mumbai, known for its authentic South Indian food. It's perfect for family dining or private dining for corporate lunches and family gatherings. This all day restaurant offers one of the most satisfying unlimited lunches in South Mumbai. Their unlimited breakfast is also a crowd favorite, and they truly serve the best Idli in Mumbai. With warm service and delicious meals, it's a must-visit spot for food lovers."
3,"A principally South Indian restaurant, it is quite expensive considering the location.
I had a bisi-bele bhath, and to me it didn't taste authentic. Further, @ ‚Çπ250, it just didn't seem right, both for authenticity & quantity. The 'papadums' were bathed in oil.
The 'hand-churned' guava ice-cream, on the other hand, turned out to be quite delicious."
5,"Fried Wanton
I recently visited Sri Krishna Restaurant in Grant Road and tried their fried wontons, crispy, golden, and absolutely delicious! The filling was well-seasoned and the texture just perfect. The restaurant is clean with a pleasant welcoming ambience, making the dining experience even better. While they‚Äôre known for their tasty South Indian food, they also serve North Indian dishes, hearty South Indian thalis, and even fast food like pizzas. It‚Äôs a great spot if you‚Äôre with people who like variety. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and range of food here‚Äîdefinitely worth a visit."
5,"During my recent visit to Sri Krishna Restaurant in Grant Road, I tried their ragi upma and I‚Äôm so glad I did. Unlike the usual semolina upma, this version made with ragi (finger millet) felt light yet filling. It had a lovely earthy flavor and a soft, hearty texture that really stood out. What impressed me most was how healthy it is‚Äîrich in calcium, fiber, and perfect if you're watching your carbs. It didn‚Äôt leave me feeling heavy, just satisfied and energized. For anyone looking to enjoy comfort food without compromising on health, this is absolutely worth ordering. I‚Äôll definitely be coming back for it."
3,Overall food is OK service is slow ambiance gives and good vibe that only good don't have proper washroom staff is not properly teach how to serve and all
1,"We had ordered Peri Peri Chicken wrap and tandoori chicken salad.

In peri peri Chicken...the chicken tasted absolutely different..so we went back and asked at the counter... the guy who made it said..it's like that only....

I protested and said when tandoori chicken is tasting like chicken...how peri peri Chicken can taste different...
Then he said its chicken mixed with Soya bean....and it's send by them to their designed supplier...so it means Subway is clearly cheating it's customer by selling Soya bean instead of giving Chicken...at a high price.

It is high time these foreign companies should have strict scrutiny...they feel they can go away with any thing in India."
5,"The Subway was very Delicious And
And the store also Good You have to
Must visit to eating Subway And the
Staff Are very good behaviour also"
3,It took quiet long inspite of me being the only customer for veg. Service is very slow..also they toaster doesnt work which happens to be a case with almost every subway in mumbai. Few sauces are not available..roasted garlic bread doesnt taste garlic
4,"Quick service, filling subs, healthy meal, treat to taste buds...all at one place. The best part is to have subway while watching movie. Being situated on ground floor of multiplex, makes it the most preferred take away. Lit ambience and double height lobby gives beautiful feeling."

5,"Had a dinner buffet here recently with my family, on the occasion of my birthday. It's one of the most iconic hotel in South Mumbai . Ample Valet Parking is available. The Restaurant is located on the ground floor.

I had done the bookings via Zomato Dining and had got a good deal.

The buffet spread is good but not too lavish. But whatever is served is good and tasty. The highlight of the buffet was certainly the Chicken Tikka. Soft and yummy.

The staff is good. Always ready to hear and serve you.

Should visit this restaurant once for the experience."
5,"Booked a dinner for 2 via eazy diner app. Visited in the evening at 7.15pm.
They had a lovely buffet worth Rs. 1200 plus taxes. We chose al-a-carte. We ordered tomato basil soup with assorted bread, chillies cheese toast and lasagna al forno.
Food quantity was sufficient for 2 people. Quality was also very good & tasty. Service was very prompt. Ambiance was rich looking and pleasant.
Will recommend this place to anyone. You can book this place via eazy diner for good offers."
5,"The great 360¬∞ Revolving Hotel, The Ambassador Hotel serves Great buffet dinner of indian and continental cuisine. Royal Ambiance with Vintage vibes. The dishes were all amazing.

Other options such as bhel and dahi papdi to start your meal. Penne pasta was yummy. Bhindi do pyaza & Aloo Jeera. Paneer butter masala + Shahi korma.

5,"If you‚Äôre looking for an authentic Chinese dining experience in South Mumbai, Royal China behind Sterling Cinema is a place you must try. I recently visited with a few close friends, and the entire experience‚Äîfrom the food to the service‚Äîwas top-notch.

The ambiance is classy yet comfortable, with dim lighting and elegant interiors that make it perfect for both a quiet dinner and a celebration. The staff is courteous, always smiling, and ready to help with recommendations.

We started with their truffle and edamame dumplings and crispy potato sesame toast‚Äîboth were absolutely delicious and full of flavour. For mains, we ordered the Cantonese-style roast duck and steamed sea bass with ginger and spring onions, paired with their egg fried rice and Hong Kong-style noodles. Every bite was packed with freshness and cooked to perfection.

Even though I was full, I couldn‚Äôt resist the chocolate mud cake with ice cream‚Äîa perfect sweet ending.

What really stood out for me was how balanced the flavours were‚Äînothing overpowering, just simple and elegant. Definitely one of the best Chinese meals I‚Äôve had in Mumbai. Will be going back soon!"

It includes 1 soup pp, 1 Dimsum pp, 1 main per person, 1 gravy pp and 1 dessert pp.
It‚Äôs a great pick for group lunch and gatherings.
Royal China, is certainly best known for their fantastic food and service. Totally Royal and classy."
4,"I recently visited Royal China at VT, and it was an exceptional dining experience. The restaurant offers a luxurious setting with elegant decor, creating a refined atmosphere perfect for a special occasion or a sophisticated night out.

The menu features a wide array of Chinese dishes, with a strong focus on Cantonese cuisine. The dim sum were fresh and flavorful. The quality of the ingredients is evident in every bite, and the presentation is impeccable.

Service was top-notch, with attentive staff who were knowledgeable about the menu and offered excellent recommendations.

Royal China is a must-visit if you‚Äôre looking for authentic Chinese cuisine in a chic setting. I highly recommend it for both its food and its atmosphere."
5,"You will feel less space while sitting or while dinning, except this there is nothing adverse about the restaurant.

Food - Good quantity and good taste.
Service- Very Good
Location - Near to CST station
Polite and professional Staff Behaviour

If you like chinese food.. Must visit here"
3,"We went for early lunch around 12 noon ,visiting after many years.
The quality of food is not the same as before .
Butter garlic pepper fish was very good ( red snapper ).
Prawns Mongolian pot rice was average, shrimp size was very small .
Though quantity was very generous.
I don't think I will be back again."
3,The overall experience was very mid we were suggested namking rice which had all mix for 655. But it wasn't worth it. The quantity was good for 3 people but the taste was very bland
5,"We ordered a desert namely Mission Impossible it was very very delicious and the quantity is sufficient for 2-3 people.
The thing which I like the most is the atmosphere and there gentle service."
4,"This is one of the oldest 5 Spice in Mumbai. The food is beautifully plated here and tastes really delicious. You can try different continental dishes here.
We always have Crispy Chicken, Sapo Chicken, Veg American Chopsey. In desserts, Mission Impossible is a must try but you've to pre-order it, and it's available on Fridays and Saturdays only. If it's not available, Rocky roads is the best option. They also have delicious Cheese cake varieties.
The quantity of the dishes is sufficient as per the price, so don't order more upfront. They have AC and Non-AC section and ample amount of parking space.
When you're done with roaming around the Fort area, this is one of the best options for dinner.
Absolutely recommended..."
4,"I have been here many times, and it has never disappointed with its taste and quality. This place serves scrumptious Chinese food. Do try their Crispy Vegetables, Apple Chicken, Panner Chilly and Peking Rice. Do not give a miss to their delicious dessert. Quantity is good. Rates are fare. Service is good and quick."
1,"I recently visited a Monginis outlet and had a very disappointing experience. Despite noticing fresh donuts on display, the lady behind the counter insisted on serving us donuts from a separate tray. She heated them and handed them over, but when we bit into them, it was clear that they were stale. We immediately pointed this out to her, showing her how dry and hard the donuts were. Instead of acknowledging the issue, she claimed that they were supposed to be like that and still charged us full price.

It‚Äôs frustrating to see such poor service, especially when there are fresh options available. This particular Monginis seems to be relying on the fact that school kids, who might not be as discerning, are their main customers. Unfortunately, they may not realize that they‚Äôre being served subpar products. This kind of practice is unacceptable, and I would strongly advise others to avoid this outlet. It‚Äôs crucial for businesses to maintain quality and integrity, and this experience was a clear failure on both counts."
1,The lady in clare road monginis franchisee is cheating a lot in pricing.. She always charges more than the standard rate on items sold in the shop ... Owner of this franchisee must be aware of this
1,I have been an old customer for 20 years. This is the  worst Cake shop which sells Expired Products. I had to return it. Never Buy Packed Products. It is hard as Stone. Please guy's better improve the quality if you want to survive in this competitive market.
1,"Woman working is very rude.
Served stale chicken roll.
I did point out the packet was puffed, to which she said it‚Äôs because she heated the puff directly with the outer plastic packing. The manger even after insisting does not give any information about how to get in touch with the owner. They even asked me to stand in a corner and that I was blocking the counter."
3,"Childhood of 80's and 90's Kids are incomplete without cakes, pastries and puffs from Monjinis. Monjinis cakes are Nostalgia.

I am having it after almost more then a decade.....

I used to buy their Swiss Roll cake which used to cost approx 40 to 50 rupees which they have stopped making it ... (please start making it again)

Tried its blueberry, devils delight and Brownie square pastry..

Devils Delight : still a decent pastry then blue berry not but mouthwatering 2/5

*** stars for childhood"
4,"This is just another regular hotel that we have in South Indian category.
The lobby is quite narrow to walk around
It's already Chaos in this outlet as there are so many people walking around.
One cannot expect a space for themselves when they visit here.

No doubt the food is good and equally is the quality.

At times they may completely ignore you and intentionally as they are super busy.

One month definitely try their vada sambar and chaas buttermilk.

Happy eating."

Dahi wada is too good , then I also loved it's hakka noodles n idli vada sambhar. N price is cheap like in 500 2 to 3 people can eat. Like their deluxe thali is for 360 Rs ... The big paper dosa with sambhar chutney n unlimited bhaji is for 200"
5,"A very famous spot in the bustling lanes of Bhendi Bazaar, this place has never failed to impress with its incredible flavors.
I‚Äôve visited several times, and each visit has only deepened my love for their Nalli Nihari.

On my recent visit, I tried:

Tawa Bheja Masala

Nalli Nihari

Thread Chicken

Triple Fried Rice

The Tawa Bheja Masala was absolutely delicious ‚Äî bursting with flavor.
As always, the Nalli Nihari remains one of my all-time favorites, truly unmatched.
Their Thread Chicken is also better than most places I‚Äôve tried ‚Äî crispy and perfectly seasoned.
The Triple Fried Rice was good, though it didn‚Äôt quite wow me like the rest of the dishes.

Overall, it's a lovely place to enjoy hearty food with friends and family. Highly recommended!"

4,"I‚Äôve been having Crispy Thread Chicken from here for years. Around 5-7 years ago, it used to taste so yummy! Now, while the taste has changed, it‚Äôs still better than what other places serve. I feel like they‚Äôre focusing more on generating money üí∞ instead of maintaining quality üßê.

The chicken pieces are becoming thinner day by day, with the threads being way more prominent üçó‚û°Ô∏èüßµüßµ. For the price they charge üíµ, they should really go back to giving those big, juicy pieces they used to serve back in the day!

5,"A Flavorful Feast at Chinese N Grill ‚Äì A Must-Visit on Mohammad Ali Road!

If you‚Äôre craving a culinary adventure that blends Mughlai richness with Chinese flair, Chinese N Grill on Mohammad Ali Road is your go-to destination! This iconic eatery, established in 1998, has perfected the art of serving mouthwatering dishes that keep locals and visitors coming back for more. Here‚Äôs why this place deserves all the hype:

A slow-cooked mutton stew bursting with spices and tender bone marrow, best paired with buttery rumali roti. This dish is a Ramadan specialty and a crowd favorite.

Chicken Malai Kebab, succulent, creamy, and grilled to perfection‚Äîtestimonials rave about its unmatched flavor.

Ambiance & Experience
The restaurant‚Äôs casual yet vibrant atmosphere makes it perfect for family dinners or large groups. During Ramadan, the area transforms into a festive hub with lively crowds, aromatic spices, and late-night service (open till 4 AM!), creating an unforgettable dining experience. Indoor seating ensures comfort, and the staff‚Äôs warm hospitality adds to the charm.

While most dishes are generously portioned, some delivery reviews noted inconsistencies in meat quantity. Opt for dine-in to enjoy the full experience.
Spice Levels If you prefer milder flavors, request less spice‚Äîsome dishes pack a fiery punch.

Dessert Pairing
Head to **Burhanpur Mawa Jalebis (right opposite the restaurant) for crispy jalebis or creamy rabri to end your meal on a sweet note.

With an average cost of ‚Çπ900‚Äì‚Çπ1,100 for two, the restaurant offers hearty portions and bold flavors that justify the price. Cash is preferred in Nagpur branches, but Mumbai outlets accept digital payments for convenience.

Chinese N Grill isn‚Äôt just a meal‚Äîit‚Äôs an experience. Whether you‚Äôre diving into their legendary Nalli Nihari or savoring the creamy Malai Kebabs, every bite reflects decades of culinary expertise. Don‚Äôt miss this gem on your next visit to Mumbai!"
1,"First we ordered mutton kabab they had used lots of fats on that. Our mouth was layered with fats was not able to swallow that used tissue paper to clean our tongue then we called manager and discuss the thing he said without fat we cannot made this dish. Our other family member said we should not order further let‚Äôs go some where else, but I told them let‚Äôs try one more famous dish Nali Nihari but it was not also that great he serve with small 4 piece of mutton with less Nihari without any nali in that. In short we are unhappy with this restaurant‚Ä¶üòûüòûüòû"
3,"Reading reviews I visited the restaurant for lunch. The Google map location is wrong & had to search to find the right location. Contrary to reviews & expectations, I was the only person in lunch hrs of 1 to 2pm, in such a highly rated restaurant. Lunch time is supposed to be the most occupied time, however it was absolutely empty.

However the Service was really nice. The staff was polite & welcoming.

Ambience & taste was really average for the segment. And prices were surprisingly very high. At the same or even lesser prices one can easily get better taste, ambience & crowd in south Mumbai."

4,"Here you will get birthday cake, aniversary cake and pastry

Do try caramel flavour cake
It was too good fresh and tastes different

Price for Bday cake  starts from 300rs for 500gm

Here you may also find other products of monginis like wafer, biscuit etc

They also accept digital payment

They don't charge extra for plastic knife"
1,"I bought monginis Swiss roll strawberry flavour......as I opened it ....it was stinking so bad and fungus was formed on the roll.....
Expiry date was of 2025
Chocolate Swiss roll taste has also changed...... pathetic"
1,No proper management  4 diffrient time i had order cake n while delivery time . thy saying cake is damage. Thy not even call n tell that ur cake is damage n we cant. Deliver. When we go to take r order thta time thy saying .cake is being damage . plz dont buy from  thr .worst cake shop
1,"Bought two donuts from Monginis Cake Shop in Mazgaon branch today. I asked the girl and guy who were there, are the donuts fresh? So the guy was busy on the phone he didn't pay attention to me and The girl says yes. The attitude of that girl and that man is very third class. And the donut is absolutely third class. After eating it, it felt like it was made three days ago. Don't you feel ashamed when selling stale donuts and cakes? I have never eaten such a dirty donut in my life. Never again in life will take anything from Monginis."
1,My brother bought these donuts. These donots were hard like 'kadak paw'
5,"Best fresh and tasty food
We ordered- Tandoori fish, Prawns, Shanghai fried rice and Belgiam desert.
All was nice.
Staff was so attentive and given the best service."
5,"Probably one of the better places for authentic North Indian Non-vegetarian cuisine in Mumbai.

We tried the zaffrani (saffron) chicken kebab, which was succulent and tender, and had a unique and excellent flavour of zaffron. One of the best kebabs in town.

Their butter chicken is special, and especially famous. While possibly rather sweet for certain palates, this is definitely an amazing preparation that is worth trying.

Overall an amazing dining experience."
5,"The staff there is really humble, they give you good suggestions too.
The food- unique, delicious and finger licking good!
The wait time post ordering meal is a little more than usual, but thats what u have to bear for fresh food at a busy restaurant.
Washroom hygiene needs improvement-a lot of it.
P.s. despite reserving your table, you would still have to wait , because if the restaurant is full during peak hours, they don‚Äôt reserve a table despite booking. So go well planned and with patience.
Desserts- top notch perfection!"
2,"After reading the reviews, I had high expectations and even passed by several other restaurants on the way to try this place.

The service was decent, but the food was a major letdown.

We started with the mutton seekh kebab, which didn‚Äôt taste fresh and had a strange flavor. Then we tried both the veg and non-veg biryanis, and honestly, they were some of the worst biryanis I've ever had.

I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
4,"Visited this place last week especially for their Belgian Chocolate Roll. I asked them to serve it with ice cream at the side. Can comfortably say it‚Äôs become one of my favourite desserts now. Yet to try their food, but I‚Äôll surely come back soon. Service can be a little better. Loved the ambience, it‚Äôs very cozy and intimate. Really has a very comforting vibe to it."
5,"One of the best chines and veg  and non veg snacks  AC hotel in the Paidhuni , Mohd Ali Road area beside Suleman Bakery.  I like üçÖ tomato soup, piza, sandwich there. You will  see reasonable prices there . Should go once there."
5,Cheese pineapple pizza was awesome. Everything we ordered was tasty and they have a very prompt service.
4,Chinese food is good and other fast food is also tastey. French fries and chicken sandwich at it's best.
1,I ordered him cheese grill sandwich and he sent veg cheese grill and that too was burnt.
3,The food taste is quite good and one of my personal favourite is the chicken Schezwan pizza with extra cheese is the best which I love and even other things are quite good as well the only problem is when they get too much order that is the time you have to wait for a while like in ramzan specially when they get bunch of orders that time you have to wait for a while otherwise on the normal days they are quite fast and the food taste is also good must try they Schezwan pizza with extra cheese i would recommend you if you are looking for snacks must order from this place and the pizza is damn good üçï thank you God bless you everyone
5,"I don‚Äôt know why this was so low-rated (3.8 when I looked). I was reluctant to go based on reviews but it‚Äôs Holi and not much is open so we chanced it. I had very good daal, rotis, and pineapple raita. My husband had an excellent pomfret thali. The waiters were lovely. There‚Äôs an AC bit that you can‚Äôt see from the road. Reasonable prices too."
5,Very tasty food. Especially their prawns and squid starters. Also try neer dosa. Would definitely recommend üëå
2,Not the desired experience. Below average food and vibe with above average pricing.
4,This is really a small place from outside but there are 2 separate sections i.e. AC and non AC. AC section mostly for families. It is neatly arranged in a small space and you wont feel cramped for sure. Alcohol is served at really affordable prices. This is a family resto bar so you can peacefully enjoy liquors with your spouse or friends. What I would like to specifically mention here is the food quality. I ordered Bangada Fry as started which was tasty and well prepared. And for main course I jad Agri chicken masala handi. And this was one of the best chicken dishes I had recently. The quality and quantity of the food was remarkable for its price. So it is nice budget family resto bar with tasty food!

5,"We visited Kebab Korner in intercontinental located at marine drive, a legacy restaurant started since 1980!

The place gives a very royal vibe with traditional old fixtures and

They are currently running a new menu - Kebab E Dastarkhwan which lets you savor authentic cuisine prepared with the finest touch.

We loved the new menu which was decently priced at 2499 plus Taxes per person

You can chose any 3 items (Veg / Non Veg) can order the same multiple times.

Choices Include the below :

Veg : Chowk Ki Tikki / Kumbh ki Galawat / Paratwala Paneer / Triveni Tandoor Phool / Butte ki Seekh

My recommendation from the above : Paratwala Paneer / Angara Fish Tikka / Nawabi Jalpari ‚Äì Absolutely loves these 3 dishes!

This is followed by a selection of Biriyani, Kulcha, Dal Makhani & Desserts

KK Signature Dal Makhani here is not to be missed & the desserts are truly shahi!

This place is located on 1st floor at intercontinental, Marine drive. They have lots of variety for kebab and north Indian food. The place is well maintained and neat. Ambience is royal. The best part is you get amazing Sea view while eating.

Food we called for was:-

Veg kebab platter (5/5)- This platter included broccoli marinated in mustard sauce, paneer Khali aaloo, veg seekh, jaitui paneer. We loved this one.

Daal makhani (5/5)- Amazingly cooked. A must order dish here.

Chole Amritsari(5/5)- We loved the chole.

Lacha chur(55/)- it's crushed paratha with red chilli as garnishment.

Oreo Tart (5/5)- okay.so this dessert isn't there in menu but the chef specially made this yummy dish for us.Thank you chef for this.

Strawberry mojito (5/5)- A very lovely and refreshing drink. I loved it.

We had a lovely time dining at this wonderful place. This place is child friendly and perfect for family get togethers.
Valet is available."
5,"Kebab Korner is a restaurant with beautiful blue and white interiors along with artistic chairs which gives it a very royal look. To top it all this place has an amazing view of Mumbai‚Äôs Queen‚Äôs Necklace. It looks stunning, especially during the Monsoon Season.

The Cuisine here is Indian and they specialize in Kebabs and North Indian Curries. I have tried a lot of Vegetarian dishes here, which is mentioned in detail below.

Truffled Mushroom Baby Kulcha

Small Soft Kulchas Stuffed with a Mushroom Paste. It comes straight out of the tandoor to your plate! It was very soft when I tried it and it had a very mild flavor from the Mushrooms. However, I couldn't taste truffle anywhere, I was expecting the use of some truffle oil at least.

Chili Cheese Baby Kulcha

Another version of Soft Kulchas Stuffed with Cheese and lots of Red Chili Powder, I could taste a lot of cheese and the spice from the Red Chili was also not overpowering. I would prefer this over the Mushroom kulcha even though I LOVE Mushrooms.

Jaituni Paneer Tikka

Giant Cubes of Paneer Marinated in Tandoori Marinate and it was sliced from between to stuff in some Olives. That gave it a tangy flavor and it was an amazing way of serving the Paneer Tikka. The only thing I didn't like is the quantity of Olives was very less and I could hardly taste any Olives.

Kumbh Dak Banglow

Button Mushrooms marinated in a Mustard Paste and cooked inside the tandoor until they become soft.

Daal Makhani

A bowl full of richness, it was exactly what you expect from a Daal Makhani. Melt in mouth Daal in tonne loads of Butter & Cream with superb flavors coming from spices like Clove, Cumin and Cardamom.

Lehsooni Palak

A very creamy concoction of Spinach and Fried Garlic, this was hands down the best dish which I had here. It is a must try if you love Spinach.

The service here was very quick and the staff had total knowledge about the Menu. Overall this place was amazing and I would definitely recommend it to someone who loves to have North Indian Food."

We ordered 2 Special Thali for lunch between 3 of us.It was quite filing and delicious!
Loved the Paneer Sabji!!!
The size of the roti was bigger than that of a regular quarter plate.
Paneer In the subji very soft and fresh and Rice was properly cooked.
Loved the Gulab Jamuns.
The Aloo Sabji also had appropriate amount of oil.Neither making it too dry nor too oily.
The 3rd subji was that of french beans and trust me it was one of the nicest subji I had eaten.
The masala was Spicy
and Dal Fry seemed a little dry but fairly cooked.
Overall it was a wholesome lunch!
Think about thali,Think about Shreeji Sagar!!üëç"
4,The place is small just like a counter outside the restaurant with some chairs for seating. The staff is very nice and courteous. The service is good. The menu consists of very selective items but unique items. I tried sweet and spicy veg roll. The taste of the filling in the roll was really yummy and tasty.
4,"The place is quite decent, nothing is wrong and not too fancy.
The menu has most of the snacks and deserts. So be cautious if you are looking to have a lunch or dinner here. As far as the taste is considered it is good."
5,"The quality of food is amazing and the quantity is also good for the price. They have good non-vegetarian options.
The place can get too crowded so you may have to wait sometimes."
3,BEFORE ENTERING THIS RESTAURANT MAKE SURE YOU ARE CARRYING CASH..THEY DONT ACCEPT GPAY AND CARDS( WHEN EVERYONE DOES ACCEPT IT AND ITS DIGITAL INDIA)... THEY DON'T EVEN INFORM YOU ABOUT IT AND YOU MIGHT END UP VISITING THE NEAREST ATM TO PAY THEM ...THEIR FOOD IS GOOD...BUT THE PLACE IN GENERAL IS UNHYGIENIC..THEIR TOILET STINKS..

A must try food joint if u are in the Crawford market area !
Highly recommended!!"
1,"Title: Unpleasant  Experience - Improperly Cleaned Prawns

I recently dined at Cafe Firdos, and I regret to say that my experience was far from satisfactory. The primary issue that marred my meal was the improper cleaning of prawns in the dish I ordered.

Upon receiving my order, it was immediately evident that the prawns were not adequately cleaned. There were remnants of intestinal veins in several prawns, which not only affected the taste but also raised concerns about food safety. Consuming prawns with undeveloped digestive tracts is not only unappetizing but also poses potential health risks.

I brought this matter to the attention of the restaurant staff, but unfortunately, the response was lackluster at best. Proper hygiene and food preparation should be a top priority for any dining establishment, and it was disappointing to see this standard not met.

I hope this feedback serves as a constructive critique for Cafe Firdos to improve their food quality and service. Until such improvements are made, I cannot recommend this restaurant to others. Cleanliness and food safety are non-negotiable in the culinary industry, and it‚Äôs important for all patrons to have confidence in the food they are served."
5,"Heard of this place a lot. Finally got a chance to visit.
Their rasgullas are classic - right amount of sponginess and sweetness. So far the best I have tasted in Mumbai. Luckily I reached when the rasgullas were still hot - what a taste!
The rasmalai was Gr8 too!
This is an old yet iconic restaurant. They have a couple of tables and also accept UPI payment.
The gentleman serving was friendly and we chatted a bit - about rasgullas!
Will surely return."
1,"We have been ordering for 3 generations from this store & most functions & distributions happen from here. I visited the store today for the first time and after this experience I would cancel this brand from my & my family‚Äôs list and would request everyone that‚Äôs concern about basic hygiene to not indulge in this brand. We were given the seat behind the washbasin & the over kept gargling in that with loud noises for 5 mins while the used water kept falling on us. When we complained- He said I am the owner and it‚Äôs my store I do what I like . I believe they could be cooking this so famous food in the toilet. So be very careful before purchasing this brand. Years of trust broken. Also, the staff is exceptionally rude & the prodcut quality is sub standard poor like the owner‚Äôs behaviour and hygiene of the store. Even a road side vendor does better than this store. On an average we would consume - 3-4 Dozens in a quarter * 5 families. Thats lost & never am I recommending this brand to anyone. Nor are we going to distribute their Rasgullas on occasions to relatives. Cancel this brand & boycott them until they fix their hygiene and care for consumers"
1,Purchased 2 kala jamun and this sweet for 108 rupees and was served in this box. All the sweet syrup leaked. How pathetic!üò¢ Charging exorbitantly more than other local stores and still this kind of service offered.
1,"Despite the positive reputation of Bhaishankar's Rasgullas, my recent experiences have been disappointing. Over the past several orders, I have noticed a decline in the quality of the rasgullas I have received. Fresh rasgullas are typically soft, white, and do not break easily, but the ones I have received have been stale, hard, and prone to breaking. While Bhaishankar's was once known for their exceptional rasgullas, I regret to say that I can no longer recommend them and will not be purchasing from them again."
1,It‚Äôs definitely a brand name till now but now they are not sale us fresh sweet jut I bought a milk cake they gave me full dry I came back and complain about it. But they not agree. I suggest u all pls don‚Äôt buy expect Bengali sweet.
5,"This is a Goan restaurant with an old world charm. Everything looks vintage in this place. The furniture, the glass shelf and the overall ambience transports one to a different era.

Had been there for an early dinner and the place was empty. Menu was written on a white board. Order was taken without delay. Tried sausage chilly fry and chicken chilly fry. Both the dishes seemed to be made in the same template, but was tasty. Had fresh pav with the chilly fry.

Prices seemed to be on the higher side for the portions we got. Service is good and the restaurant is hygenic.

They accept only cash payment."
5,"Went to Snowflakes restaurant recently delicious food. Try Chicken Chilli fry just amazing!! Nice hospitality, friendly staff. One of the old restaurants, a heritage. We were taken there for the first time by our college on heritage walk to show old heritage  restaurants. Went there a second time to try the food really loved it."
3,"The most simple and true Goan restaurant near Metro Cinema, Snowflakes is my sure spot for fish on Saturday. It is run by a very pleasant Goan couples who are always welcoming.

Speaking about the food,it‚Äôs tasty. My list of must try is below:
Russiad Bangda
Chicken Xacuti
Amotik
Fish cutlets (made from shark meat,must say yum!!)
Fish curry rice

Don‚Äôt set very high expectations around ambience or service,this place is a homely establishment at best. You may see a pet cat lurking under the shelf‚Äôs or the table.

Also let me mention the food that your get is at great price so they soon run out of it. Be sure to come early to not miss anything."
3,"A place steeped in nostalgic charm, though sadly devoid of patrons during my visit. I ordered the humble fish curry for Rs. 160, along with the Goan pork chili fry‚Äîunexpectedly featuring carrots, a twist I‚Äôve not encountered elsewhere. The tongue roast was a standout‚Äîdelicious and velvety‚Äîthough the accompanying potatoes felt slightly underdone. This fuss-free eatery serves homestyle food, run by an old gentleman at the counter who seems to have witnessed countless eras of this country. The total bill set us back around Rs. 760, give or take. A heads-up: they don‚Äôt accept UPI, so it‚Äôs cash-only. You‚Äôll find this gem in the lane right across from Kyani Bakery‚Äîenjoy!"
5,"First ate here in 1999, when a plate of sorpotel cost Rs 25. A quarter century later, the same dish costs ten times as much (thanks to inflation) but the taste and ambience remain largely unchanged. One of Bombay's historical eating houses; it'll be a sad day when this joint shuts down. But as of now, it's going along."

Service is good waiters are so friendly. Food is also awesome with live screening."
5,"One of the oldest Bars in Mumbai , Awesome experience in here. The waiters are just too good. The food is awesome. Drinks are available at a good cost. Overall a wonderful one. A must go for a decent budget."
1,"Kitkat basically has another bar just beside it. ""Harvic"" Which they claim to be cheaper but is no. Secondly it's a disgusting place with their chairs and tables having bedbugs in them. Very bad experience."
4,"Restaurant is good, cost also normal as all bar have, both AC and non AC room available, location is good, only bike parking available here, music player available here and you can play your choice of music with 20 rs of coin. Thank you üòä"
5,"I had an amazing experience at Kit Kat Restaurant & Bar last week! The food was absolutely delicious. What truly made my visit memorable was the exceptional service provided by the staff. From the moment I walked in, they were attentive, friendly, and went above and beyond to ensure my satisfaction. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a fantastic dining experience."
4,"Ordered pastries from Monginis it is good place to have dessert they have varieties of pastries as I have tried devils delight, zebra torte, chocolate brownie, pineapple, black forest, Red velvet, rainbow, mix fruit,butter scotch, pastries all were awesome in taste and also the quality was good. They also serve burger, pattice, burger, pizza."
1,As  you can see the attached cake pic. After informing  the delivery of damage cake  got unexpected excuse from person that they cant exchange the cake &  we  damaged the cake purposely. come on how come is possible that we order cake for someone special birthday and spoiled purposely really doesn't it make sense with his reply.Also We have requested  to mention name with Happy Birthday Tag that was also not done. Suggestion for that sale person to learn how to talk customer and understand what they want.
1,I regret it !!! Worst I have ever had ...think 100 times before ordering
2,"Worst snacks of the town. Taste of puffs n patties and snacks is not good and seems to be kept for days.

The owner should keep fresh products otherwise people will stop visiting the place. They don't even serve it hot."
5,Monginis is a always a delight ....as It has a nostalgic attachment since childhood of Zara chak ke dekho....and to add to our experience it becomes an added advantage when the Shop owners attend you with a warm smile and treat you will all their attention. .....Always a please to Visit Bora Bazar outlet .....as the store owner are always available to help

The staff is friendly and co operative for visitors."
4,"If you are in CST vicinity and craving for vegetarian food then do visit this place, clean, all veg and lotnof options available"

4,"Such a nice restaurant for snacks, lunch and dinner with reasonable price  and goodatmosphere . located at fort near residency hotel ."
5,"We had triple schezwan rice, coke and Manchurian gravy. It was delicious and we had an awesome experience. 1 full plate of Triple schezwan Rice can easily be the full stomach of 2 people. We just have to ask the waiter to give 1 full triple rice in one by two. The food mentioned in the picture is 1/2 of the full plate. Pricing is also very reasonable. Schezwan Sauce (slightly sweet)  is also very delicious"
4,"Owner Mr Antony is really very kind
And the staff is very helpful...
Pav bhaji here is worth to try...
Its really delicious üòã
Also ask them to give the red chutneyüòç its really awesome.
Be early to try the tava pulao. As it gets sold out really fast otherwise you have to wait..."
5,"This place is the perfect example of best street food. The food was of affordable price as street food should be. The hygiene was great.
The taste of the Amul butter pav bhaji was so good, that even after my hunger was satisfied , my heart didn't. You can literally feel different flavors with butter blending perfectly and the masala pav with them is just Nirvana.
Must visit if you are in Churchgate.
The service is also fast, for quick and hunger satisfying bite."
5,"This place serves the best Pav Bhaji I‚Äôve had in Mumbai that too just at ‚Çπ50/-
It is a must visit whenever you‚Äôre in South Bombay! They even listen to you and customise it (making it more spicy etc)
They serve Chinese food as well, which also tastes good but the Pav Bhaji is just ü´∂üèº"
4,"Read about this place on instagram and have been wanting to try since a long time, i finally went here with high hopes. Needless to say, i wasn't disappointed at all! Ordered for the Veg Manchurian rice priced at 80 rs and oh boy, the quantity kind of scared and amazed me, haha. It was yummy and my Desi Chinese craving was satisfied üî•. Totally, going next time to try the pav bhaji from here. Go for half plate, if you don't have a huge appetite."
5,"Very superb taste, i tried behja with tandoori breakfast üíì"
5,The biriyani we tried was out of this world. The potato in the biriyani was also flavourful and service was fast....A bit crowded on rush hours but worth the wait ‚úãÔ∏è üëå
4,"Good place to Dine during the holy month of Ramadan. üòä
Do try their Haleem, mutton Doh pyaza, sheek kebab and their chicken fry.... They were ultimate. Plus try mutton Nihari, tandoor, mutton biriyani, bejafry, gotifry etc.
Plus their very customer friendly service.
Enduldge in good food at a very reasonable price."
1,The owner(s) or whoever sits on the counter of the restaurant are very rude. They talked to to us in a very ill-mannered way which was very disheartening. They absolutely don't know how to talk to a customer and how to listen to customer feedback. I would NEVER recommend anyone to visit this place as there are numerous restaurants that serve much better food with politeness and great customer service.
1,Worst staff over arguing bringing the food on their own don't visit

Nice food but very limited seating, had to share our table with other diners.
The food was tasty and hot."

We had :-

Food Quantity is good.
The place is congested."
4,"A small eatery place but amazing to have some lip-smacking Indian Chinese food.
We have ordered veg Manchurian and chicken Hakka noodles.
Both dishes were tasty and good enough in quantity and can be shared in two easily."
3,Average service. Okay for a short visit. Good for large groups. Usually not at all crowded at daytime. Don't expect great food here. Price is reasonable.
5,"Nice food specially chicken crispy, chicken chilly, daal khichdi and Tandoori

All yummy :-P"

5,"So good experience with them üòâ
The food was very good"
4,Very affordable rates. Simple Veg Thali is available at only Rs 90. Location is on the main road.
1,"Not worth a rupee, they are serving frozen stored chicken and chapattis are bought by restaurant from outside and they serve it after reheating it , for rice they will serve you rice which was cooked once in morning and if asked why it looks spoiled they will take that back and bring it after reheating it. Soo my suggestion just dont go there"
4,"Good and pocket friendly place to eat in CST area.
Restaurant is not so fancy. But they offer really good food. I always prefer Veg Panjabi Thali at this place, I have tried biryani also but the taste is not that much good.

1. Food quality (4)
The food is nice and simple, not so spicy.

2. Cleanliness (4)

3. Poker friendliness (4)
I can assure you that you will not get food like this at the price they are providing in nearby area of this location.

4. Ambience (3)
As it is situated near trafic signal, the trafic will surely irritate you.

5. Staff and services (3.5)
Staff is really nice but not that much energetic. Always on battery saver mode"
5,"Overall it's above expectations!
Interior, Ambience and mainly food
Our ordered food was fantabulous. Mushroom soup was really good. The way the mushroom was chopped was amazing.
Pot rice was superb and roti- Sabji was also good."
5,"The place is really worth it,this is my second visit and it‚Äôs must try place,food is delicious best atmosphere best service by sher khan(tiger).personal assistance with quick service.must try biryani, chicken lollypop"
5,"Dropped by IT‚ÄôS LUCKNOWI near CST last weekend on a friend‚Äôs recommendation, and honestly, I wasn‚Äôt expecting to be this impressed. The place has a quiet, classy charm‚Äînothing too flashy, but you immediately feel the Nawabi vibe the moment you walk in.

We started with their Galouti Kebabs, and wow‚Äîsoft, flavourful, and just the kind of melt-in-the-mouth experience you hope for. But the real hero of the night was the Mutton Korma with Sheermal. Pro tip: Don‚Äôt miss this combo. The korma was rich and perfectly spiced, and that slightly sweet, soft Sheermal was the ideal pairing.

The staff was super helpful and friendly, which made the experience even better. They happily walked us through the menu and even suggested portion sizes based on our appetite‚Äîthoughtful touches that go a long way.

Also tried the Lucknowi Biryani and a Paneer Qorma for the veg folks in our group‚Äîboth got big thumbs up.

Overall, if you love North Indian food and want to explore authentic Awadhi flavours, this place is a gem. It‚Äôs got soul, it‚Äôs got taste, and it definitely earned a spot on my go-to list."
5,"I‚Äôve been visiting It‚Äôs Lucknowi for quite a few years now and they‚Äôve still not changed, the staff is always helpful and friendly.
Their Awadhi Raan Biryani is something that‚Äôs really really good and something worth trying, and will keep you gripped onto it everytime you visit the place.
Overall, it‚Äôs a fantastic place for North Indian food lovers."
5,"We visited Its Lucknowi for lunch on Eid 31st March 2025. It was an absolute delicious experience our server Sherkhan and captain Suhail advised us on the dishes as per our choice. We has Mutton Galoti, Mutton Sheekh Kabab, Amith Lasooni Kabab and Amith Nizami and the Shahi Tukda was also good but can be more crunchy. I want also thank Mr Nasrullah for this beautiful lucknowi experience. Must visit place for Awadhi food in Mumbai."
5,Amazing service and food. I will visit here again before I leave Mumbai
4,Food was okk type good.....
5,"Good food, nice Ambience, courteous service and reasonable price."
5,Delicious food and excellent service and a good ambiance ‚ù§Ô∏è
1,"Slow service. Insufficient light. Even a simple misal paw took 15 minutes.
Half star."
4,"Small place so there‚Äôs always waiting and very stuffed. Tables are placed very close to each other. Service is slightly slow for the kind of business they have.
They serve chaas in beer bottles.
We ordered things and they came all jumbled up but the food is great"
3,"This is another iconic and legendary restaurant in the oldest business district of Mumbai serving delicious food since donkey‚Äôs years.

If location is got anything with the success & popularity of a restaurant, this place is an example of the exact opposite. Located next to the Masjid Bunder Railway station, one has to climb down a couple of stairs to reach this place. You will have a constant company of railway bogies passing by at set durations.

This place is small but well laid out and very clean. The kitchen is open and right in front of your dining table. The servers are experienced, know the dishes well and have suggestions for you in case you feel lost on what to order.

It‚Äôs a guarantee that any dish you order under the various headings that the menu card boasts of is fabulous.

We ordered for the following:

SEV TAMATAR: A trademark serving from their kitchens, one should have it for sure. Mildly spiced tomato gravy is mixed with thick sev and topped with thin sev. After having a couple of morsels, I realized that this dish is made sans onion & garlic and is yet so flavourful.
NOT TO BE MISSED

DAL TADKA: Their trademark method of preparing Dal Tadka is topping it up with caramelized onions. The dal is very yummy and the addition of onions takes it to a different level altogether.
NOT TO BE MISSED

PAPAD CHURI: I believe they have pioneered this dish. A papad is broken into pieces, sev is mixed with it, red chili powder is sprinkled over it, topped with caramelized onion and garnished with fresh green coriander.
NOT TO BE MISSED.

CHAPATI: Fresh, healthy and hot off the tava is how the Chapati is served here. If you like it with butter, a blob of butter is placed on the hot chapatti, watch it melt and consume it with the Bhaji.

CHAAS: Chaas is their speciality; thick, creamy and served with a dash of their secret masala. The Chaas is a delight to have. They also serve it in tall dark coloured bottles that resemble beer bottles.
NOT TO BE MISSED.

The damages for all of the above & some extra chapati‚Äôs came to Rs.445, all inclusive, for 2 persons; what can define VFM better.

Service is at the speed of lightining, efficient and friendly.

Though the business today has branched out among the families and each of them has attached their initials to the old brand name, the food remains the same and continues to delight the palate of the patrons."
1,"Just an old shabby place serving truck load of oil and spices with traces of actual food.

Go there if you want your triglycerides to set a world record!"
4,A trusted place for vegetarian dining in the area.  Once you actually go there and see for yourself.
1,"Once it's famous for Quality but I visited after 20 years and surprised me paneer butter masala was  hot but served leftover gravey of lunchtime and paneer was chewy. Ghee roti's are roasted  second time.

As it's dinner time around 9 pm and I was the only customer.
When I complained for Quality there's no satisfactory reply from owner side.
Try on your own risk..."
5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Faham Restaurant & Lounge, and I can confidently say that it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. The moment I walked through the doors, I was greeted with a warm, inviting atmosphere that set the tone for an unforgettable meal.

The ambiance is perfect for both intimate dinners and casual gatherings. The elegant decor, combined with cozy seating and ambient lighting, creates a relaxed yet sophisticated environment. Whether you're looking to unwind after a long day or celebrate a special occasion, Faham offers the ideal setting.."
1,"*Disappointing Experience at Fahm Restaurant*

I recently visited Fahm Restaurant, expecting a pleasant dining experience. Unfortunately, the reality was far from it.
The food was lukewarm, which was a major letdown. Considering the lengthy wait time for our order, I expected it to be served hot and fresh.
Speaking of wait times, the delay was ridiculous. We had to wait for an inordinate amount of time for our order to be taken and even longer for the food to arrive.
To make matters worse, the service was subpar. I've experienced better hospitality at a local tea stall. The waiters seemed disinterested and ignored our requests on multiple occasions.
Overall, my experience at Fahm Restaurant was extremely disappointing. With cold food, ridiculous wait times, and poor service, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."
4,"We were pleasantly surprised by how the place turned out to be. Faham provides a delightful experience. The ambiance is inviting and we ordered a sizzler along with hookah which tasted really nice and the quantity was quite good. The flavors of both the food and hookah are exceptional, creating a memorable outing. Friendly staff and a vibrant atmosphere make it a go-to spot for a relaxing and enjoyable time."
3,"Even though the restaurant was really empty the service was really really slow, after every dish we had to wait for almost 15-20 mins.
Apart from that, being a non veg food lover, I enjoyed paneer crispy more than chicken crispy which happens rare in my case.
Talking about ambience
9/10
1 point less because of restrooms.
Restrooms in this restaurant not hygienic and clean also I would like to add people smoke ciggerate in this restaurant's restroom. After complaining for the same to the staff, I got answer ""they work here only, and can't go out to smoke during working hours"""
5,"Faham restaurant and lounge.
Recently visited this place with my family and was so happy with the service. They have a very beautiful interior and great ambience. They gave us the separate family AC room which was peaceful. The set up was the dastarkhan setup , which was quite good and comfortable.
Faham has you all covered with different types of flavours of hookah and many more,
What we tried
Hookah :
* Dubai Spacial ( must try )
Mocktail :
* Mojito (must try )
* Fresh Lime Soda
Starter :
Lassuni Chicken tikka ( must try )
Achari Chicken tikka
Main course
* Faham Special Kepsa
* Butter chicken ( must try ) with tandoori rotis and butter naan.
Dessert :
* Sizzling Brownie

This place is good for spending quality time with family and friends both. Thank you for the Wonderful evening!"
1,Please don‚Äôt visit this cake shop The staff is very rude
2,I visited this store for once and the service was terrible. They have no knowledge of treating the customers properly. They refuse to provide an extra spoon or carry bag and that too in a very ill-mannered and an impolite way.
1,"No doubt, all products of Monginis are too good  but  behaviour of franchise shop on 56/D Mohamedali Rd, Mumbai with customer was very rude & bad. After buying 6 muffins & a cake pack  of 3 pcs, the owner of shop ask me to carry all stuff in my hand (without any bag). I requested him to give me in a bag, he refused by saying that we dont have any bags. When i pointed that you have bags, he demanded additional Rs 5 for that bag which doesnt cost more than 30/40 paise and misbehaved with me by saying that go out from the shop.
Disappointed with service and for sure will never step in this outlet to buy monginis product."
5,Best to place for having cakes pastries and savouries.. good communication skill with customers..

5,"Chunkies have now did a renovation on their Minara Masjid branch. It now has a very cool air condition, seating.

As always, the staff is absolutely amazing, very helpful, and the food is as good as it can get.

Home delivery service is available as well as Zomato and Swiggy orders are taken, the response is super quick. They get their food ready, real fast.

Comparatively, the price is quite cheap, and the quality is impressive .

I would recommend the burgers
to people travelling nearby ."

All Menus Of KFC you can buy here üòã
Fried chicken üçó was so yummy and fried chicken burger üçî must visit

Thanks for reading üòá"
5,Best  and clean cafe snack place in Mohammad ali Road Mumbai
1,The nuggets was not at all good in taste. The taste was bitter like the chicken was kept for 3 to 4 months back totally waste of money. The street food are better than these food.
4,Super good eatables at pocket friendly prices quality and quantity is superb and the combos are very delightful do try the chicken strips as they are delicious
5,"Saw this drink on the menu (forgot the name) that sounded interesting. The waiter advised against ordering it, but we were feeling adventurous and went for it regardless. It's not recommend for diabetic folks, but if you have a sweet tooth and can handle some extra sugar intake for the day, go for it. It's quite an experience. The Pav Bhaji was nice too.
The only downside was that the were only accepting cash."
4,"Very popular eatery in busy area, Good variety of local food, beverages and local desserts on menu with variety of options.  No bookings required.  Seating area upstairs and downstairs in diner format.  Place order with staff who deliver to table, Service was quick and friendly.  Can accommodate small and larger groups.  Food was tasty and good portion sizes. Well priced, good value."
2,Wery average in taste simply over hyped. I was here after a very long time. But not happy at all because taste was below average in fact. Even the road side falooda tadtes better i think huge scope of improvement.  Just a suggestion keep less items in menu but customer should come again out of craving.
4,"Took my daughter and her boyfriend here so they could taste the falooda and find out for themselves what the hype is about!

We visited around noon and as expected the place was quite busy. However, we were seated immediately and the wait staff was very good. We only had a couple of items and they were brought out quickly.

Looking around the room, it seemed there were quite a few customers who were there because of the reputation of the place.

All in all a nice place to take a quick break if you are in the area or after visiting the market next door.

N.B.: The falooda still tastes as good as it did several years ago!

‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
4,"I recently visited Badshah Colddrinks and Snacks, and I must say, the experience was amazing! The taste of their falooda and kulfis is absolutely delicious. I highly recommend trying their Orange Kulfi‚Äîit was truly exceptional, the best kulfi I‚Äôve ever had in my life! I‚Äôll definitely be coming back for it. The Strawberry Kulfi was also delightful.

I noticed many people ordering Pav Bhaji, which looked very tempting and had an amazing aroma‚ÄîI‚Äôll try it on my next visit. The staff members were friendly and helpful, but there‚Äôs room for improvement in their service. When I asked for water, they provided only one glass even though we were two people. It would be better if they offered water to all customers as soon as they arrive.

Lastly, please start accepting online payments for more convenience. Overall, a great place for snacks and desserts. Looking forward to visiting again!"
3,I visited this place some time back on the recommendation of my followers because this is the only place in zaveri bazaar which serves Khamni so i had to try it. And beside khamni i also saw they serve pyaaz kachori i tried both. Starting with the pyaaz kachori it was fried in pitch black oil. I personally do not care about the hygiene and stuff but this was so bad that i had to care. And if you are eating do not put onions on top as the one which i had were spoiled i guess because getting a strong taste of onion which i personally didn‚Äôt like without onion the taste of only pyaar kachori was good. Same goes to khamni the taste without onion was really good although ‚Çπ35 is abit expensive but one time try can do.
3,I had here amazing Aloo Pyaz ki Kachori for the for the first time it tastes really good and it's different from normal dahi kachori guys definitely try it you will love and I had tried Sev khamni here which was okay price 30rs bucks worth the money
4,"This place is great.

For some killer Pyaaz kachoris, this is the place to visit. Everything else is pretty mediocre"
1,"I used to love this place, I have been coming to this place for years, however recently when I went there the vibe of the place has completely changed! It is no longer the same old Pyaz Kachori corner it used to be! The new owner is very arrogant and a complete liar, the masala of the kachori has been ruined! Also one can make out from the kachori shape that an ameture is making it.

Just posting this so that he doesn't fool more people."

We tried aloo pyaz kachori here and believe me they will never disappoint you.
There is a options for khaman dhokla or sev khamani but we give try to kachori as more people was ordering it.

5/5 for hygiene their utensils look clean not like other which become black. They make kachories in front of us and its aroma of Hing just make mouth watering.
Small shop but too much people gathering here usually a wait here."
5,Delicious food with consistent service. Have tried multiple items at Multiple occasions but the taste is always a top notch along with Hygiene. Kudos to ZAS team!
5,"Delicious food. Though i have tried many options from menu,  kababs and seekh biryani is my favourite choice.

Good thing is you get excellent taste at reasonable price.

Must to visit place as well as you can place home delivery orders."
5,Most Of My Order is From Swiggy  The Malai Tikka Biryani & Chicken Boneless Biryani is My Favorite. Excellent Food Quality & Well Balanced Menu Card At affordable Price. Best Taste & Quality.
3,Ordered the food from through Swiggy. Quantity was good but felt like almost everything which I ordered was made out of Readymade packets. Like pattice of burger or chicken nuggets seems to be Readymade one. Taste was just fine.
4,"Reasonable priced non veg items. If you are hungry and want a decent choices at your door step, ZAS kicken is a fairly decent option. From dry items to Tiffin are offered at reasonable price. Nice collection of traditional sweet are available."

5,"A Memorable Dining Experience at B Bhagat Tarachand

I had the pleasure of visiting B Bhagat Tarachand one evening, and it was truly an exceptional experience. From the moment I walked in, the warm and welcoming atmosphere made me feel special. The staff, including the waiters, manager, and even the owner, were incredibly courteous and attentive, going above and beyond to ensure I had a wonderful time.

What stood out the most was their willingness to make a special dish just for me‚Äîsomething not even on their regular menu! The dish was absolutely delicious, showcasing the chef‚Äôs skill and dedication to customer satisfaction.

The ambience of the restaurant is elegant and inviting, making it the perfect place to enjoy a meal. The service was impeccable, and the friendliness of the staff added a personal touch to the entire experience.

I highly recommend B Bhagat Tarachand to anyone looking for not just great food, but also a memorable and heartwarming dining experience. I will definitely be returning soon!"
4,It's nice place service and staff members are good at behaviour and they service tasty food even if you buy 1 thali between 2 person they give empty thali so as 2 person can share and eat food.
4,Oh god!! I got confused. But I realised after the meal and came out. I tried the best hotel nearby and got the name Bhagat Tarachand with the best rating. Then it was a walkable distance and at last I came into the street and I saw the name board Bhagat Tarachand. Then I entered and then realised it's a veg hotel. The food was good. After finishing i came out and had a little walk then I saw many Bhagat Tarachand hotels with different initials üòáü§†. The one that I saw the best was starts with I Bhagat Tarachand. So please do a thorough check and then enter the right hotel.
2,"I have had thaalis at all outlets and variants(R,B,K) of Bhagat Tarachand in the city and this fairs thenlowest amongst all. At every other BT restaurant,thaali has multiple dals and sabzis but this one only offers two sabzis and one dal per thaali with 3 rotis,papad,one sweet and a bottle of chaas. Just across the street is another BT which offers 4 sabzis,papad,raita,sweet and aamras as per availability along with chaas,rice and rotis. The quantity was standard but the taste was nothing exemplary. Also the service was really slow even though it wasn't a rush hour.
They can do much better with providing an authentic BT thaali experience by increasing the variety."
4,"After a long walk through Mumbai Streets, the place to relax and sip a coffee or tea.
With a pinch of olden times still reflecting on the walls of the dinner, enjoy the tea ‚òï and savour Every moment of it.

Not that spacious tables yet can accommodate more than 30 people comfortably.

I had tea and to be Frank it was really hot üî•, yet the aroma was really refreshing.

One of my recommendations after a long walk through Mumbai."
3,"It a small cafe, near CST Railway Station. Basically Serves a very good cup of tea. The taste is excellent but a little costly. Also Serves a lot of non veg food. The owner is very good. Staff is very active and well behave and polite. The place is very neat and clean. Smoking and drinking is prohibited, it's a family cafe in the heart of VT station.

Didn't tried any food their so cannot give any rating."
4,"Food is the only thing which is good here
10/10.
Ordered a Veg Kolhapuri with ButterNan.

One guy just roams around watching everyone's faces and what they are eating weirdly.
I guess he's the owner who doesn't know how to behave.

And the team who cleans the table and some of the waiters should stop having gutka in their mouths while on service at least
Because of all these epic people working there, the atmosphere is zero.

Food is tasty tho
No waiting time.
They serve you quick and hot."
3,"Water was served after completion of my meal.
No service calls for reorder.

Ordered for Dal Butter Fry and Tawa Chapati, Dal had a square piece of butter floating on asking why is so..answer was it is served this way.
I asked for takda of garlic and Red Chilli, to this the waiter replied no takda in butter fry.
Did not have coriander leaves also in. Dal.
As taste was nice, had my fill ,paid and left

If you want service don't visit this place..but if taste then do visit."
4,"Hands down!!! The best place to have mughlai dishes in CSMT area. They serve one of the best food. It was a hot afternoon, me and my friend  were in the CSMT area, looking for a good place to have lunch. I started searching on Google and this place was near for us. So, we went there without even having second thought. The place was ready fulfill our bellies with scrumptious food. We ordered 1 butter chicken, 3 plain roties and half mutton biryani and it costed us Rs. 385/- only. This place is pocket friendly and tasty as well. Highly recommended üëç"
5,Specialiat in hukka food was awesome great place to visit
5,This is always my Evening stop before heading home from job. Always delicious. Always great service. Always worth the stop.I highly recommended it if you‚Äôre in the South Mumbai (Sandhurst Road) area.
4,Specialties of Hukka Food best ever in Mumbai

5,Great place to socialise for boys
4,"After a long time, I finally tried what is touted as the best burger in town.They provided seating options for their next restaurant, Mazzeh, which is owned by the same proprietor. I highly recommend trying the lamb burger; it was incredibly juicy and flavorful"
3,Food is good. But for Muslim Sunni  will not go there due to Masla & Masaeel on Religion with shiya. Personally I will not eat but others are going. But i  heared finally the food was very good testy and Delicious. But costly
5,"i love fcc soo much..whenever i crave burgers or wraps i alwaysssss have fcc in my mind‚Ä¶fcc never dissapointssss
recommended- zinger burger,super spicy chicken burger,chicken strips, majestic wrap,zinger whopper, chicken popcorn
earlier i tried the pizza menu which was okayishhhhh not that good..ive had better pizzas imo BUT THEY DO JUSTICE TO THE BURGERS WRAPS STRIPS AND FRIESS‚ù§Ô∏è"
5,"The Best Stop for Yummiest Burgers and other Snacks.
The Whopper Burger here is the Best Selling and must say its the Best üíØ"
3,"Extra crispy chicken tenders, wrapped around a soft tortilla wrap and filled with lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and mayonnaise, we thoroughly enjoyed it! The Chicken Popcorn was crispy but average while the Zinger Chicken Whopper was stacked with a crispy chicken breast and a minced chicken patty. Alongside we ordered for a Sizzling Mexican Chicken Roll that came with a hint of sour and spice. Worth a try."
1,"Please read before visiting!!!

We tried their Weekend Buffet

The soup was okay and u can easily feel the smell of raw chicken.
The first two starters (Hariyali Chicken and Chicken Tikka) were very tasty.
The remaining six starters (Al Baik Chicken, Pineapple, Paneer tikka, Aloo crispy, BBQ lollipop and Chicken Crispy) were not at all good as they were missing the base taste of each dish and all dishes tasted similar.

Time for the Main course!!! Only the chicken makhanwala was okay okay but the remaining Paneer and Dal were disgusting.

Finally the Desert!!! The most important part of Buffet is Desert but here you get only two small Gulab Jamuns (thats it) which were slightly big than a berry.

Awful Experience!!! Never gonna visit‚Ä¶..

Total Damage - INR 1216 (for two ppl)"
4,"The owner is great welcome
Food is good, customer service is good
Ps be specific to the staff when you order  example if you order chicken specify how many pieces otherwise by default its 6 pcs"
5,"I visited Yesterday with a group of 25 people
The service is really good.
Imran and Sahil attended us and provided good service.
The food was delicious
Few highlights which I would like to mention would be the chicken lollipop and Crispy chicken in starters
We ordered Mutton Nizamuddin, Mutton Lahori were really good.
Don't forget to order their Matka Rabdi
I've added the Unlimited menu of the week"
5,"Ordered chicken barra with paratha for two people. It was excellent. Very creamy and the chicken was very tender and juicy. The parathas were very flaky and buttery. It tasted good on it's own.

Waiters were friendly and the service was fast. Highly recommended place."
5,"What a food,,I like the food very much and taste was amazing as per unlimited food it is Paisa wasool place as per me...they give you 8 types of starter,,main course also very nice and at last u will get custord that is also nice...price 499/-plus GST that around 525/-Rs per person...that is very nice in this range with taste,,food and ambience..."
4,"Been here a couple of times in the last four years. It‚Äôs a place I would recommend for visitors who are new eating out in Mumbai. Authentic yet safe and hygienic. We had chicken leg in gravy, which was good, and seekh kebab which was a bit dry but really enjoyable accompanied by a kind of coriander chutney resulting in a fresh mix.
Very reasonable prices."
4,I went to Rehmania and ordered Seekh Paratha I must say that the seekh Paratha is still the same taste as what we used to have in Al Rehmani restaurant. Do not forget to order their special Daal Makhani.
5,"Rehmania Restaurant.
Famous in town.
One of most famous seek kebabs and tandoori restaurant.
Delicious and mouthwatering taste.
Seek kebabs and tandoori are absolutely delicious one.
Best for lunch and dinner.
Good for family kids and friends.
Good for quick bite.
Quick service.
Good quantity.
Crowded during peak times
Neat and clean.
Clean Environment

Recommended: Must Visit.
Love to visit when I go in Mumbai."
3,"This place is known for their seekh parathas but the quality has gone down now. Visited after years here and was left a bit dissatisfied. The place first of all lacks hygiene for sure, it's gotten bad over the years which is clearly visible. The table I sat down on had a pool of water under it, which no one noticed until I moved to another table and brought it to their attention. Had the seekh paratha and although not bad but not as good as it used to be earlier. The seekh tasted just fine but lacked any juice and was quite dry. Paratha was just ok and was breaking into pieces. They probably make and keep it for long. Portion size is ok as the seekh seems to be smaller in size now and pricing is decent still. Servers need to improve on hygiene.

Atmosphere - 2/5
Service - 2.5/5
Food Quality/ Presentation - 3.5/5
Taste - 3/5
Portion size - 3.5/5
Value for money - 3.5/5"
5,"As most places in this area, this has become a lot more expensive. The good thing is that the quality is maintained. The sheek kabab are visibly smaller but they taste the same as what I remember. I haven't had a lot of other dishes here: only chicken tikka and leg piece and they're okay."
4,"I order Mutter masala, Taste was awesome üòç For one person to have rice and chapati with it. A perfect thing to order. Not sweet not much spicy üëåüèª"
1,"The hotel was closed a long time ago, still shows open and Available on Google Maps"
5,"Very tasty food...! you must try their ""Desi Ghee Daal Fry"""
4,This is one of the good places to have vegetarian/vegan north Indian food. The prices are reasonable and taste is good. Ambiance is not that great 3/5. Service is prompt and can be visited often. Use Apps and Offers to avail discounts :)
1,"Ordered Puri Bhaji, Sada Dosa, Alu Tikki. All were badly prepared and tasteless.
Nanumal Bhoraj from name thought they serves Alu Tikki best but that was worst ever I saw any where in world.
Advise to skip this restaurant and it is worst in all aspects."
5,Nice
3,
5,
1,"Today date 20/08/2024 Very bad atmosphere, and seating area is  very uncomfortable, there is no place to seat properly and the food is not as good as the review given by the people.
Today is my first and it will be the last"
4,Good Bengali style food. Had difficulty in finding the shop. It inside a small lane. You have to take a left turn at the phophalwadi point. The sitting space could be little cleaner.
3,Decent and Budget Bengali food. Hygiene is an issue eating at the restaurant. Get the food packed and eat at own place.
4,Would anyone share restaurant's phone numbers here because their phone numbers mentioned on the site is perhaps invalid
4,"Great value for money. Place order on phone, come over to collect the food, go home and eat. Good food."

5,"Without any doubt the best place to enjoy a variety of non-vegetarian cuisine but I often visit only to have their special sweet ""Cream Cheese Kunafa"". Guys do not miss it, you will never be disappointed."
5,"The place is amazing, with great food, excellent service and nice ambience. The staff was very cooperative, and the food was presented to us within 15 minutes, point to note it was not a rush hour. Might cost a person 500-1000 Rs depending on the order placed. Since i went with my friends, the expenditure was 500 per person, but again it depends on the order.
We tried Mutton Paya(trotters) Soup, and for the appetizer Chicken Tshinghai."
4,Visted here during ramadan fasting to have iftiyari. Foods for iftiyari there will be counters outside this restaurant but too too expensive and its not worth also. There staffs are like keys winding toys should wind them properly then only they will response. One good thing what I felt about this restaurant is that they allow customers to bring outside food and have it during iftiyari and also they give complimentary fruits for iftiyari. So we took falooda which is ok ok in taste but still again expensive too. Restaurant is clean and hygienic maintained but staffs are like no intrest to work. During ramadan time food is after 8:00PM.
5,"Ramadan in Mumbai is synonymous to visiting Shalimar Restaurant in Mohammad Ali Road for me!
No visit to Mohammad Ali Road is complete without visiting this iconic Restaurant!
Year on year they have been able to maintain the same high level of taste - The Mutton Nihari, Mutton Biriyani, Reshmi Paratha, Kebabs - are absolutely mouth-watering!
The service is good and fast. There‚Äôs always some waiting (especially during Ramadan), but then the fast service and the large seating capacity (spread across 2 floors) ensures the wait time is not that much!
Will keep on coming back for more!"
4,I had gone here with my friends to have Ramadan food. They had verity of dishes and also veg options too. They have big seating arrangement ac and non ac. Also the staff is good.
1,"Calculate your own bill because these poor thieves charged extra 60 rs for nothing and on top of that, my 3 side accompanies were missing yet they still charged the price of missing items. I hope this place shuts down for these thieves. Also there are small cockroaches roaming in the kitchen and on corners of seat. If you want to get sick then do eat here. Absolutely disgusting behaviour. Thieves."
5,Very very tasty and delicious food served here almost staff is very polite I like the taste.
5,"Tastiest non veg ,close to CSMT station,at a reasonable price ,clean environment"
5,good place for non veg lovers. Especially thier keema and anda ghotala are a must try.
4,Good hotel for tea and snacks items. The management is also well.
1,Yesterday I order 2 to 3 items veg and non -veg both as I saw paneer fried rice in menu card so I order I took the parcel and went home while opening the food I saw paneer fried rice with egg üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò° while taking order they should asked or on menu card they should mention egg paneer fried rice again I came to hotel n told that counter uncle old man he is saying paneer fried rice me egg aata hai waste of money do not visit Here they are just runing they hotel for money because they are not even sorry for it.....üò°üò°üò°üò° Please do not visit kausar cafe
5,Nice place for lunch breakfast and dinner  in small budget. Especially the kheema. And all the other items its have great taste in all veg and non veg food.  If you visit bhindi bazar or near by mohammad ali road. For lunch or dinner you can visit here. Very famous place cafe kausar.
5,Good Restaurant for moderate taste and quality food and snacks.
5,"Cafe Kausar left a lasting impression with its exceptional Beef Pulav. The dish showcased a remarkable blend of spices and tender beef, creating a flavorful and satisfying experience. The commitment to quality was evident, making it stand out as one of the best in its category. The ambiance at Cafe Kausar complemented the culinary delight, making it a highly recommended spot for those seeking top-notch taste and a cozy dining atmosphere."
4,"Best authentic Indian cuisine such as bajra roti, variety of veg & non vegetarian options."
5,"Barbeque nation Nerul is on Palm beach road, near signal.It is on 2nd floor above HDFC Bank, very accessible.
Parking is on road side.
Food: lot of variety in Veg and non-vegetarian food, starting from drink, starters and main course buffet and last sweets & icecream.
Staff is cooperative specially Kartik.
They work hard to make you happy by serving your special dishes.

You can also sit on the terrace to have a open Palm beach view .
I loved to visit there."
2,"Barbecue Nation Nerul Review

Barbecue Nation was once one of my favorite places to eat, but unfortunately, this Nerul outlet has significantly declined in both service and food quality, making it one of the worst in the BBQ Nation chain.

The non-vegetarian options are merely acceptable, while the vegetarian selection is particularly disappointing. The staff behavior was concerning - they argued with customers and pressured us to purchase drink offers, which was surprising as BBQ Nation staff used to provide some of the best service in the restaurant industry.

I hope management will properly train their staff and improve their menu to restore the quality this chain was once known for."
4,"Sat outside in the garden area, mentioned a birthday, got a free cake and birthday song celebration. Starters are the best thing here. I wish they had sushi and crab similar to Global fusion. The main course and desserts are located far from outside seating. The washroom is okay. Splitting the bill on multiple cards was not possible üòî as the bill is sent using QR code. Courteous staff and kulfi are awesome. The live counter was so so.."
4,"It was nice experience Service was awesome all the Staff were very good in service.
The starters were great Lolipop was too good The main course was a little bit disappointing Chicken Biryani was tasteless  Deserts were good."
4,"This is a nice place for people who like to have lots of starters and dessert.

Food was good but not great at that price point. Desserts were nice. Kids enjoyed the fried ice cream a lot.

One thing I always appreciate about barbeque nation is that the service is always good. They are happy to listen to your requests and get whatever you want."
2,Very bad service. Food in not good.We order one thing and get another. Bread sticks were ok ok . Pizza had no taste. They gave mayonnaise and charged 30 instead of cheese which was of 20. I was told table service but they were calling by oo aa
1,"Had a disappointing experience at Pizza Hut. The staff was extremely unprofessional‚Äîdespite asking 3-4 times, we were not given the bill. The service felt careless and inattentive.

To make matters worse, there were no plates provided, and the tables were dirty and uncleared when we arrived. The seating area had a lot of mosquitoes, which made the whole dining experience uncomfortable and unhygienic.

Definitely expected better service and cleanliness from a well-known brand like Pizza Hut. Not planning to visit this outlet again anytime soon."
5,"The coffee was amazing, and your staff's cooperation with us was truly appreciated. I also loved everything pizza ü§§üçï"
5,Staff behavior found very humble. Ambience is good and proximity is also very convenient
1,"Pathetic experience from Pizza Hut Delivery. We are suggesting not to order from Pizza Hut. All items' delivery was also not given by Stores, local centre numbers are not reachable. If Pizza Hut Team wants more details, pl reach out to us. Complaint is already raised with Call centre."
1,"I had bought tandoori chicken tikka sandwich for RS 261/- at Viviana Mall Thane.
Today I ordered same food item at this store. The person was asking for it RS 300/-
I invite be aware about looting way of this food out let. How come price has increased for about 15% more ?"
3,"It's the best place to go when in a mall. Quick, healthy and tasty food. Not just now but for more than a decade.

The staff however this time were not so polite.

The sub of the day are no longer existent.

The food was tasty. Especially love the variety of sauces and veg / pickle options. The staff Gave a deaf ear to add more jalapenos.

The bread is always so soft and fresh.

They should definitely try frying or grilling their meat instead of just microwaving it. May taste better."
1,"I was charged for single cheese for subway which price was jncluded but it was charged additional as extra. Disappointed. I showed counter person, Karan Singh and asked for explanation. He said it is recent change. I believe this is for this outletonly."
2,"The worst subway I have been to in my life served stale food and the outlet smelled bad. This place did not. Hence it is the second worst Subway I have experience.  And I have been to many outlets across India.
The staff lied and was rude. They could not explain the new items on the menu. Finally they said the new item was claimed to be "" cheesy and spicy"" because it was supposed to have chili mayo sauce,that wasn't there with the normal subs. So I ordered that. Then,after insisting that I pay first,he said, that sauce isn't available and anyways the sub you have ordered usually goes well with southwest ,toh voh chaleha kya. So he lied about the special sauce or he he was deceptive about booking the sale without having the special sauce.
Then ,when asking about the bread, he said all breads available.  So I asked for Honey Oats. Then his staff informed him it's not in stalk and quietly told him which 3 breads,out of the 5,were in stock. Then he turned to me and said, the one you want isn't there,which would you like. I asked,which others are in stock. He lied again and said, sab hai ,apko kya chaiye. So I said the most basic one just to get over this part of the process.  Then when laying out the vegetables on the bread,he didn't ask which I wanted,he just put what he felt like. Then I had to stop him from closing it,and to add some other more interesting vegetables that we usually don't use like olives or jalape√±os. He was otherwise just going to give onions,tomatoes and capsicum.
Then finally,after packing the sub,he tried to upsell me on the cookie and drink. I said no. And this is after payment,he was trying to sell a combo.
He had given me a horrible experience,so  I said no. Then, to try to make me feel worse about my purchase ,he said,if you spent above 400, aapko discount de deta. I asked,where is this discount scheme written. How much discount. Then he changed his story to no,not discount but one free ""toastie"" would have been given. I asked,again ,where is this deal written about? If subway really ran such a promo, they would put posters about it so that people would spend more than 400. He said ,nahi ,voh hamare shop ke taraf se. I said,then you should put poster so that people know. And that free toastie is not discount.
Then he continued lying,said that if I had spent about 500, he would have given 100 off. I said how,where is it written.  Then he again said,nahi actually subway discount nahi details par hamare pass special vouchers hai joh hum bahar dete hai coupons pe,hum voh use kar lete hai. Again I said,then you should give all this information beforehand.

Horrible salesperson.  Ruined my entire experience."
1,"I visited Subway at inorbit mall Vashi. The staff was really bad in servicing us. They did not have these slices but insisted that we take mozzarella.
When asked for tissues they gave e1 tissue for foot long.which we ordered for 3 2 people.
I had to ask twice to get more tissues.
I was there with my daughter who insisted that she wants Subway, hence I bought it, otherwise I would have have left the sub.
Extremely bad service.
It's not only the product but the people who make it successful.
Pathetic attitude of Manager."
5,"I walked in - placed my order and just as I was about to scroll through my phone I noticed a little sign‚Äî‚ÄòScan, review, and get a free Gulab Jamun!‚Äô Curious, I did it, and within minutes, a warm, sweet treat was on my table.The paneer pulao was a bit too oily for my taste, but never mind‚ÄîI absolutely loved the Gulab Jamun! That sweet treat made up for it!"
2,"Does not meet the expectations we keep prior to visiting this place, there's nothing good about it as such which I can specially mention.
We ordered two Full Thalis which took 20 mins to come and was served all cold, not even the chapatis were hot or freshly cooked. Pretty disappointed there.
Next we ordered dal baati churma but it took way more time and was served cold too.
Service is not so good as only one person handles everything and we have to keep calling him everytime for everything.
After all of this, the taste is also not good, so there's no reason to visit this place. Avoid it."
4,We ordered liti chokha thru swiggy... The packing of food good and taste of food good.. And price also reasonable..
5,"One of the best veg restaurant in Nerul. The food here is just amazing. Taste is very nice. Their menu is quite pocket friendly. Also the staff is very nice in service.

They have good amount of seats. A decent ambience. We tried their Aloo Paratha, Chole Puri, Veg Thali, Daal Baati. Everything was so good in taste. Also their sweets are very nice.

A full thali at just 150. Rs. is amazing. Also the quantity was good."
3,"Ambience is good. Staff and cashier uncle  is helpful. üëç
Tried aloo palak paratha which was ok.not so tasty.
Paratha they gave with green chutney which was not so yummy.for dahi you have to pay extra. Punjabians paratha is eaten with dahi not with green chutney.
Bhendi ki sabji was ok.
Gulabjamun was ok, not so fresh.
Expected there must be tasty food in dadi ka khazana. But failed.
People who want something different, apart from ghar ka khana taste don't go here.
But people who want ghar ka khana in less price can go here.
Prices are reasonable for some items.
My bill was just 120 rs.for paratha, bhendi ki sabji (quantity is good)and 2 pc gulabjam.

One thing i like that they have books to read on each tableüëç"
2,"We order Rava dosa and cheese grill sandwiches.

Sandwich was good, but cheese used doesn‚Äôt seems to be from reputed brand. Cheese wasn‚Äôt good. Don‚Äôt order anything related to cheese.

Rava dosa was below average, sambar was too average and you can get better sambar at any South Indian restaurant.

This place needs to improve in terms of food, especially in South Indian food.

They need to maintain the standard or else they are below average South Indian restaurant available in Vashi.

Cost is also on the higher side, but that is manageable.

Staff and location is good."
3,"We had hyderabadi Biryani The biryani was avarage,like their service and sitting arrangement & environment of the hotel."
5,"Its my go to place ,
Its reliable , delicious and reasonable .
I have had dinner , breakfast and lunch here

2) filter coffee without sugar
3) cheese pav bhaji
4) paneer kadai
5) dosas"

The restaurant's ambiance is cozy and warm, with a beautiful waterfront view. The interior decoration is inspired by Kashmiri culture, adding to the unique dining experience surrounded by ducks
The service at Shikara Restaurant is generally good, with polite and friendly staff. However, some reviewers have mentioned that the service can be slow, especially during peak hours."
5,"I recently visited Shikara Restaurant in Navi Mumbai's Sanpada which is  near sanpada railway station.
The ambience caught my attention as it was made of Kashmiri House Boat Theme Shikara. There were ducks roaming around which made it pleasant to sit & dine. Live music was an treat to my ears. Just loved the ambience they have AC as well as outdoor seating

What we had

Tangdi jafrani 500
Shikara fruit punch 350

Great place for Family Get Together, Birthday Parties, Office Parties, with live music."
5,"Recently we dined at this place located in Sanpada Navi Mumbai.

Hilmalay ki choti: my favourite dessert

Loved each and every dishes we have been served and would like to thank you for such a great service management.
Would love to visit again with my Office colleagues."
1,"The worst restaurant I have ever visited!!! I mean worst‚Ä¶ A rat ran under my table, poor ducks being tortured with overpowering lights, a duo singing like they are on gun point‚Ä¶male singer is good i would say but the female singer needs to stop‚Ä¶ food tastes pathetic‚Ä¶ I ordered triple veg fried rice‚Ä¶ rice had too much oil and the gravy was only onion and when i say only onion i am saying only onion‚Ä¶ bcoz of the loud music i asked them to parcel my food and here are the pictures to show you guys what veg triple fried rice looks like"
4,"Hahaha, this is a pretty little place if you're someone who enjoys your drink if in a lil shady bar once in a while. Service is quick & they play nice old Bollywood classics over a tiny television set. Have two divisions for AC and Non AC, cost effective, decent food. Good for guys gang. Cheers"
4,"Good place for drinking out.. food has find taste.. good part is.. smoking is allowed.. you will get the upper floor with airy atmosphere .. and less lights.. makes perfect place for drinking.
You can get both take out or delivery on orders.. 200-400 per person. It's close to palmbeach road.."
3,Just Average food!!!! Parcel is better than eat in cause the crowd isint cordial.... And Yuck sleezy Ac room is suicide for Non Smokers. Still the same service here is a major issue. The waiters behave as if they are doing a favour on us by serving our table.
3,"This is local bar and restaurant divided into three sections. AC/NON AC at ground floor and Open terrace. There's nothing called ambiance. Terrace seems perfect to sit. You can have beer as well as all other drinks here. Its good place to sit with your group. Rates are pretty much normal here.
You can eat Veg and Non Veg here as well as Chinese and indian food."
2,"Need to Improve in Ambiance. its Look Classic n Old age.
Food was Okay,
Staff Service is Good
Menu Price is also Okay

Need to Upgrade Quality, Ambience n Many more Things To Get Customer Attraction.

Jay"

3,"Small bar
No AC
Food not good."
1,The experience was pathetic I asked the staff it‚Äôs very juicy and tasting like pizza he doesn‚Äôt even care please dominos take care
1,"I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction regarding an order I placed on 18th April 2025, for which the payment was successfully deducted, but I neither received the pizza nor any refund to date.

It has now been over 10 days, and despite multiple follow-ups with your support team, all I receive are vague assurances that my concern is being treated with ""priority."" Unfortunately, there has been no concrete action or update, and I fail to understand what ""priority"" means in this context.

If the item was out of stock, it should have been clearly communicated at the time of ordering. Instead, I am left to bear the consequences of your team‚Äôs oversight, which is unacceptable.

This experience has been extremely frustrating and disappointing. If you cannot fulfill orders or ensure timely refunds, such aggressive promotion of your services is misleading.

I expect an immediate resolution and refund of my amount. Please treat this matter with true urgency."
1,Domino's Palm beach store service is very very poor.... they gives first priority to their online orders and keep customers on hold at store. Secondly what quality food they are serving they should be ashamed on it.....current staff just ruined the quality and brand name of Domino's.....
1,Well I have ordered from this outlet many times and every time I have faced same problem. Poor bread quality. Even same with garlic bread. Their garlic bread tastes like stale dry bread with no essence of garlic. Worst and pathetic. After complaining staff about it the answer I received is it's supposed to be like that only. Hell no. I have experienced with other outlets of Domino's too. It's not same. Shut down this pathetic place or redo all place and change the damm staff.
1,"Avoid this Domino's location like the plague. This store is an embarrassment to the brand‚Äîevery order is a gamble, and you always lose. Toppings are barely there, quality is a joke, and customer care is nonexistent. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre daring you to come back just to disappoint you again. I genuinely regret giving this place so many chances. If you value your time, money, and taste buds‚Äîstay far away. This store shouldn‚Äôt be in business."
1,"No cleanliness.

Edit:
No change even today also
45 min for order
Dirty
Will not come again"
5,Management really great specially Anita ma'am she's given me complimentary food because before served me cold food so she's call me and request to come again and enjoy food and that time is food amezing and good thanks burger King and Anita ma'am
5,This burger king is literally fabulous and the food served over are also dilicious and juicy ü§§. The staff behaviour's are also very friendly and kind. I just love the place very much. A dish you must try is Chicken crispy burger which is very juicy ü§§üòã. And if you want veg food then it also had dilicious veg burgers
5,"I recently visited the Burger King outlet near DY Patil College, and it was a great experience. This place offers a variety of veg burgers, cold beverages, and other items like cold coffee and veg patty, making it a good choice for a quick and satisfying meal.

The veg burger was fresh, with a perfectly crispy patty and soft buns. The cold coffee was refreshing and had the right amount of sweetness. The overall quality of food and service was impressive.

If you're in the area and looking for a good burger joint, this Burger King outlet is definitely worth visiting!"
1,"Had a very disappointing experience at Burger King. When we arrived, many tables were left dirty and uncleaned, creating a messy and unwelcoming atmosphere. We politely requested the staff to clear a table, but they completely ignored us.

When we went to place our order, we were told it would take at least 30 minutes‚Äîwhich is quite unusual for a quick-service restaurant. To top it all off, around 9 PM, they abruptly closed the counters, saying they ran out of buns. For a burger place, that's honestly unacceptable.

Overall, the service was poor, the hygiene was lacking, and the experience was far from what you'd expect from an international food chain. Would not recommend this outlet."
5,The best biryani at an affordable price must try and also good quality and quantity was nice.
5,"One of the best biryanis I have ever tasted , wonderful taste and spicy as well"
5,Best Biryani ever.  One should definitely try. You can seat there and eat or can take away. Seating area quite congested if crowded.Taste is good. One of famous biryani shop's in sanpada. Good taste!! Loved it!!‚úåÔ∏è
4,Best for biryani near sanpada or Nerul.  taste was quite good üòä. At good price.
5,"Best biryani one can get. Amazing quality and taste. Very good service. Good quantity and at affordable prices.
All the people working there are very good at service and are professional.
On normal days you get chicken and veg biryani and on Sundays mutton biryani is also available.
Must try biryani!"
1,"Pathetic experience!!! They keep products reaching expiry. I bought their Shrewsbury cookies along with Plum cake, 2 days ago. My fault i didn‚Äôt check the date on the cookies. I checked it today and the product had expired. So, i went back to the shop and asked if they can exchange it with a fresh pack as i hadn‚Äôt opened mine. The staff checked all the boxes for Shrewsbury cookies and they were expired. The staff then called the shop owner and he simply said we won‚Äôt exchange. I left the box there."
4,Monginis cakes were the savior at first...‚ò∫Ô∏è Some of their cakes are lipsmacking..üòã but for some the crust is quite dry... You need to make sure it is freshly made..as their freshly made cakes are yumm..üòãüòã i have had a variety of monginis cakes..It is located in Sector 10.. 10mins from station and Nerul LP... Monginis is also located at nerul station...
5,Very sweet staff members all things should handle in politely thanku so kuch
1,"I had veg puff today , it seems that it was not at all fresh üòï,  I order an from that puff the pungent smell was coming I complaint to store manager he said that if you want to eat then eat it otherwise throw it in dustbin üóë an give my money so I had throw puff in dustbin and I also had pay from the worst puff I had till now"
5,I have been fan of Monginis since my childhood and this shop located at nerul is my favorite when ever I visit at his it's full of variety cakes & puff & moshin is like my friend he always suggest me new launch Monginis is best
5,Quality waffles and short wait times. The staff was courteous and the shop was clean enough. The prices are slightly higher than the competitors but the experience is better too.
1,"Rating 5 stars to 1 star now, Never ever try Almond base waffle, I ordered Naked Nutella(almond base). Too much crispy and not cooked from inside, the staff was good they replaced my order with a new maida base Naked Nutella."
5,"Small boutique joint that does excellent waffles, shakes and other sweet stuff. It's mainly a take away. You are of course welcome to eat there which we have a few times now.
It is pleasant cool in the heat and the ambience is yuppy."
4,"The ambiance here is great, waffles are very much amazing just the perfect place for people having sweet tooth. I just felt that the stuffing between waffles could have been better and made heavy as the high price of it they are taking."
1,"Dear Front Desk Team,

Kindly ensure that all guests are treated with respect and courtesy, regardless of their appearance or attire. It's important to maintain a calm and professional attitude at all times.

Thank you for your understanding."
1,"Ordered a chicken sausage pizza with a chicken zingy parcel at dine-in. It was 4:30-5pm, the AC‚Äôs were off and the condition at which we received our order was this(we received our order after 25 minutes) after that while eating two female employees started arguing and yelling loudly at the restaurant. Had a very bad experience. Very much disappointing."
1,"Worst ambience worst food quality food not serving us it was prepared but not giving us s good the time differences and the ambience in the photos really disappointed by this outlet dominos should see this and take some serious actions‚Ä¶.
Really a worst outlet not recommending to come here better take delivery‚Ä¶."
1,"One of the worst outlets I have ever been to, the employees here don't have sense on how to behave in front of customers, all of them are rowdies ,I've witnessed shouting, yelling and also physically fight  .It takes forever to just punch in your order , getting it to the table is another task, you will have to ask 10 times about your order . Overall a very pathetic experience."
5,"Chicken sausage and barbeque chicken ‚ù§Ô∏ègood in taste. Nice staff. New Rome style pizza available in India nowüòçüòç
Tried new paneer and capsicum pizza with videshi sauce which was good in taste but paneer and capsicum ratio is like 4:10üôÑ This pizza not for rs. 49, but for rs. 114. So don't go with their offers üòúNowadays Domino's only accepting birthday party ordersüôÑso you have to takeout pizza... Loved veg tacoüòçüòãüòã"
1,"New shape of pizza has been introduced by Dominos
the Store manager never receives call and never takes the feedback seriously. I don‚Äôt want to take name
Wasted money on pizza"
5,"I love monginis cakes from my childhood
Ashish is best person he suggested us new designer cakes , Tall fancy cakes"
5,Good cakes with excellent taste.
5,"This is the best cake shop in sanpada.I have taste all the cakes of monginis.I met Ashish uncle in the shop,he is very good."
2,I think it is a highly rated pastry shop by the public.. Had 2 pastries here today... The taste was not as per rating given on Google map. The cake was not soft... It was not fresh probably. They had only 3 varieties of pastry. Will avoid this place for pastry again ..
5,Good experience and fresh cake üéÇ making wonderful
4,"As per our requirement Rakesh Das suggested us on order & it was nice. Taste, quality, quantity, his service everything was excellent."
5,Rakesh Das suggested us on order & it was very good and tasty quality nd quantity  was nice üëç
3,Inside decoration is nice. Food is tasty. Food quantity is very less. Rice quantity is less. Chicken quantity is also less. Not a value for money.
5,Good
5,"Best view inside the hotel good service,loved this place"
4,"Spice It is a fine dining restaurant located within the IBIS Hotel in Turbhe, Navi Mumbai. It offers a diverse menu featuring Chinese, North Indian, and Continental cuisines, with an average cost of ‚Çπ1,500 for two people for buffet dinner."
5,"An impromptu dinner plan led my family and me to Spice It at Ibis Navi Mumbai, a spot I hadn‚Äôt initially considered until I saw their newly revamped food menu on a dine-in app. Being part of a business hotel, I didn‚Äôt expect a wide variety of dishes, but what awaited us was far beyond my expectations.

Upon arriving, we noticed that the menu was accessible digitally via a QR scanner. However, the staff, in their thoughtful approach, went the extra mile and offered us a tablet device with the menu already loaded, making the ordering process more convenient for everyone, especially those who prefer the ease of a digital screen.

The friendly and attentive service set the tone for a great evening. We were enticed by the variety of dishes and ended up ordering quite a few. Each dish had its own unique charm. The paneer kadai was a revelation with its creamy, rich gravy, while the soft paneer cubes were cooked to perfection. The chana masala was bold and flavorful, with a spicy kick that gave it a satisfying depth. The chicken biryani stood out with its fragrant, spiced rice and tender chicken pieces, offering a symphony of flavors in every bite.

The unexpected star, however, was the khow suey. This Burmese-inspired dish came with a coconut curry base, noodles, and a selection of condiments, giving us a playful mix of textures and flavors that went from creamy to tangy with each spoonful.

For those with heartier appetites, the restaurant also had a buffet option, covering a diverse range of appetizers, main courses, and desserts. It was perfect for those looking to explore different flavors in one sitting.

What started as an unplanned evening turned into a memorable dining experience, thanks to the combination of great food, exceptional service, and thoughtful touches like the easy-to-navigate digital menu. Ibis Navi Mumbai exceeded my expectations, proving that even a business hotel restaurant can surprise you with culinary delights.

Thanks!"
4,"Our recent dining experience at the hotel restaurant left us thoroughly impressed, despite a slight delay in service due to the unavailability of the buffet. Upon inquiry, we learned that the buffet is typically arranged for groups exceeding 25 guests, which made perfect sense considering the relatively modest crowd.

Perusing the menu, we opted for the non-vegetarian offerings, and we were not disappointed. The Kababs were both tempting and delicious, setting the stage for a delightful meal. Accompanied by Real brand juices, which although standard, were refreshing and enjoyable, our appetites were duly whetted.

Moving on to the Chicken Chilli, we were treated to a dish that was simply amazing in flavor and execution. The delicious Chicken Soup served as an appetizer was a comforting start to the meal. The main course offerings of Chicken Handi, Chicken Biryani, Roti, and Butter Naan were equally exceptional, each bite a testament to the culinary prowess of the kitchen staff. The flavors were simply magical, leaving us unable to adequately express our satisfaction.

A highlight of the dining experience was undoubtedly the dessert selection. The Hot Gulab Jamun paired perfectly with the Vanilla ice cream, providing a sweet conclusion to our meal that left us craving for more.

In terms of presentation, the cutlery was impeccable, adding an extra touch of sophistication to the dining experience.

In conclusion, our experience at the hotel restaurant was nothing short of exceptional. We eagerly anticipate returning for dinner in the near future."
5,"My stay at ibis was made 10x better by their great breakfast spread everyday (mainly because I'm food-motivated)

Adding a few photos here of my breakfast from my stay of 2 weeks.

They have a breakfast buffet with a live order counter.
The buffet follows a standard pattern, with slight change in the specifics, summary below -
1. 3 types of cereal
2. A choice of warm and cold milk
3. A choice of 2 fruits (pineapple, watermelon, papaya)
4. A choice 2 fruits juices (carrot+orange, ABC, watermelon, and my favorite - cranberry)
5. Bread, butter, 2 choices of jam
6. Yogurt, sprouts, chutney
7. Idli, vada, poha
8. Stuffed Paratha (Aloo, carrot, gobi, soya keema, etc.)
9. And oats porridge on some days

The live counter caters to specific needs cooked to perfection, on the spot. I tried scrambled eggs, plain omelette, chicken sausages, and masala uthappam.
The scrambled eggs and sausages were my favorite, and the masala uthappam was also very very good!

You also have the option of having coffee / tea.

Overall, I loved the food and i liked the variety offered each day!"
4,"Restaurant of the ibis hotel which is primarily into accommodation.  So don't expect much in terms of variety of foods.

But nevertheless the taste is great for whatever the list of menu items they have.

Ambiance is very lively.... service is a lil slow.....

Enough parking space to make your commute easy.

I had ordered Chinese cuisine which i recommend to the people visiting there.....
The food which was served just had right amount of spices, specially "" Chicken Thupka"" and chicken chilli...."
4,"Vasundhara offers a delightful dining experience with its inventive menu and elegant ambiance. The dishes are beautifully presented and showcase a fusion of flavors that are both fresh and exciting. Standout items include the flavorful curries and the perfectly grilled meats. The service is attentive and knowledgeable, enhancing the overall experience. However, the restaurant can get quite noisy during peak hours, which might detract from a relaxed meal. Additionally, while the prices are justified by the quality, they are slightly on the higher side. Overall, Vasundhara is a great choice for a memorable dining experience with just a few minor considerations."
5,"We ordered dinner which was 1 butter Naan and 2 Kulchas with Paneer Kaju Masala.The taste of Paneer Kaju Masala was very good and quantity was also enough for 2 people.The atmosphere was good and staff also well mannered with fast service and hygiene in the restaurant.Must visit for veg lovers,many options available"
5,"Slow service! Have to wait for your food until you feel sleepy enough
food is not that great either 6/10
Nearby to the vashi station you can have normal food here just to kill hunger otherwise not recommend.
Has a separate Ac section too,
Decent ambience,
Waiters were good, attentive & hard working."
2,"Pros:
-budget friendly as compared to mall food ;)
-cheap and reliable fast food and Desi food
-near to inorbit mall and vashi railway station
-vegetarian restaurant or whats left of it

Cons:
-poor hygiene in restaurant and its WC
-too many flies within restuarant
-had stomach aches after I had food :("
5,"The Amazing place just opposite to Vashi Railway Station.

They serves delicious veg food.

The restaurant has a very casual seating, both- AC and non-AC,. Both sections are good in terms of ambiance.

Staff were well trained and our server Mr. Randip Singha was helpful and friendly.

Few dishes that we tried here:

MOCKTAILS

VIRGIN MOJITO
SNOW BALL
MOSAMBI TWIST

They really have some amazing variety for mocktails,
SNOW BALL is the finest mocktail they have , the watermelon blended with vanilla Icecream tastes too good

STARTERS

KOTHIMBIR WADI
Golden brown fried wadi and crispness drooling in the mouth.

HARA BHARA KABAB
Best and forever favourite.

MUSHROOM CHILLI DRY
Another good Chinese starter. Tasty.

VEG MANCHURIAN DRY
Very nice in taste and perfectly cooked.

MAIN COURSE

VEG CHILLI MILLI & KULCHA

Scrumptious and tempting red gravy with mix veggies goes well with kulcha.

DESSERT

Awesome , perfect ending to our meal.

If you're looking for some pocket friendly restaurant in and around Vashi station, this is the place I would Totally recommend!
Overall it a must go place for vegetarians. They have lots of variety and quality, quantity is also good of the food.
Had an amazing experience here!"

5,"I was looking for a healthy meal in a food court of Inorbit mall. But I couldn't find early because all I knew was stores like McDonald's, burger king, etc. Then I got my eyes on Falafel which was totally new to me. I never tried Lebanese food, so I was looking forward to have it.
Good thing here is they make it in front of your eyes. So I asked him the name of that dish and he explained nicely. Then I ordered here for Hummus with Chicken Shishtaouk in Hummus platter menu.
I didn't expect such healthy food with a great taste.
I totally loved it.
Food- 5/5
Highly recommended!‚ù§Ô∏è"
1,"Ambience - since it is a small outlet in inorbit mall.....it's like khoda pahad nikla chuha this time....
Location - one love for vashi-ers..inorbit mall
Service - the waiting time was not more than 7 mins...I was offered 20%off on order over 300 bugs in falafel thru book my show app....the manager kept saying me their software is recently upgraded due to which th wasey don't know where to add that code.....we explained that he should have requested bookmyshow to remove their coupon frm their app....he kept avoiding...since I love different kind of cuisine which was completely different that we find in India, I still tried....
Food - ordered Hummas salad, Greek falafel with pink lemonade....no complaints for food as it was perec.. vegetables were properly chopped and fresh...Happy eating and drinking...tip of life: if u consume alcohol, do not drink and drive pls..... rather use my ola code ""1KJNN4"" and reach Ur home comfortably...."
4,"Good food. For first timers to Mediterranean food, it may be an acquired taste"
4,Price is a bit too high for the proportion however taste is good and spicy.
4,Best place to Eat Healthy and Delicious food at the same time.
4,"Always wanted to try out food here at Bikanervala, vashi. Visited for evening snack bite and ordered a few chaats. Panipuri was average. Raj kachori did win my heart. Service was okay as we had to wait long to order and also for the bill. There was only one person going to all tables. Overall it was a good experience also the place is beautiful."
3,"Food was really good malai soya chaap was amazing even achari soya chaap was good, We tried raaj kachori it was also up to the mark but lassi was disappointing very watery."
1,"With such a big brand i thought food will be good.

It was worst Pav- Baji was to sour..main point is.
The don't use AMUL BUTTER in Pav-Baji they use nutrela Butter..so cheap.. this thing ruined whole taste of food..."
3,"Great food.
Location is perfect.
Clean and well maintained.
Easily accessible.
I would recommend to eat Indian dish instead of pizza/burger/Momo. We didn't find that so good.
The only reason, the restaurant is rated 3 star is for REALLY SLOW SERVICE.
They took almost 30 minutes to take order
Waiter didn't really felt responsive.
Seeing the other reviews that shouldn't have been the case but it is what it is.
Hope they will be good to me next time."
5,"Best place to eat delicacies from Delhi, their food tastes the same as it did in Delhi. If you're planning to eat chola bhatura visit during morning and afternoon time. Alot of variety of sweets, try malai cup it was great. Their Chaps were super soft and yummy."

The pizza tasted more like a pav/bun and very little sauce and cheese.
I so didn‚Äôt like the taste of it.
Won‚Äôt recommend at all!"
4,"Pizza Hut hits the spot with friendly service and delicious pies
Pizza Hut delivered a satisfying experience on my recent visit. The staff was friendly and attentive, ensuring our drinks were refilled and our pizzas arrived hot and fresh. We opted for a classic pepperoni pizza, and it did not disappoint. The crust was perfectly crispy, the sauce had the right amount of tang, and the cheese was melted to gooey perfection. The atmosphere was casual and relaxed, making it a great spot for a family dinner or a catch-up with friends. Overall, Pizza Hut provided a solid dining experience with delicious food and friendly service."
5,"On 1st December Friday, my family n I had buffet dinner here. I had some problems while making card payments but the cashier n staff were kind n patient with me, really appreciate it.

The buffet was value for money with 2 veg n 2 non veg options n Pepsi, all unlimited.

There were only around 3 or 4 staff working but 1 stood out fm the rest n his name is Shahid. I was greatly impressed by him as I noticed he was looking after the entire floor alone. He collected food fm kitchen n served the tables, cleaned up after customers left, attended to requests n orders, even working at the cashier at times too. He's also v proactive n observant, appeared at the right time even without us prompting, i felt like im being served by a 5 star restaurant staff.

It's really difficult to find such a hardworking staff with great attitude while maintaining a friendly n humble front even wen work gets busy. He's super efficient n worked really fast, multi-tasking.

I'm writing this review to highlight to the management about his exemplary work n hope he gets the dues he deserves. Shahid, pls keep up the excellent work n may u have a really bright future!"
2,The taste of Pizza Hut has drastically declined over years and this store is no exception.
2,"Pizza Hut's tandoori paneer pizza used to be one of the best Indian style pizzas in my opinion. unfortunately the taste of this pizza has now completely changed. They are using some kind of a sour tandoori sauce to bring that flavor instead of an actual proper tandoori paneer that was properly marinated. I don't think I'm ever going back here to a pizza out again.

From a quality of food perspective, the first pizza was overcooked while the second was undercooked. The service of the restaurant is still decent as they replaced the first pizza free of cost."
1,"Taste - 0/10
Service - 0/10
Customer Care - 0/10

Drinking tea at this place is total scam, I asked about ingredients used for making tea but the person lied about all of it. No sugar / milk powder offered at this location.

I really want to give this location a 0 star. Will request the Inorbit Mall to close this stall."
1,"Not worth of any Price.
The most tasteless tea I ever had."
4,"I love to eat bhelpuri,Ragda pattice,Dahipuri,and sevpuri. Nice making by 2 people"
5,Taste is good
4,Ok
5,"If you're craving authentic Pan Asian cuisine in the heart of MaviMumbai, at Vashi then Soy Street is definitely worth a visit. The restaurant offers a delightful culinary journey through the flavors of pan Asia .From the moment you step in, the ambiance transports you to a very aesthetic feeling.

Whether you're a fan of Sushi, dim sum, noodles, or stir-fries, Soy Street has something to satisfy every palate.

3,The restaurant offers wide varieties of  chinese cuisines. There was a waiting time of around 15 mins. The interior of the restaurant is well themed. Coming to the dishes. We ordered a pork starter and dim sum both of which was below average. They were having a special menu of Ramen. We ordered one ramen and that too was not upto the mark. The broth had indian masala flavour and the pork was uncooked. The dishes were not at all upto the mark for the price we paid. The waiters also are not trained to suggest speciality of the day.
5,Authentic and amazing Japanese cuisine. The service and the quality of food was equally excellent. Will visit again for sure!
4,"It is a very lovely location on the first level of the InOrbit Mall Sector 30 Vashi Navi Mumbai,Inside restaurant its beautiful atmosphere also with a balcony-style outside seating area.The cuisine was excellent, and the cost was extremely affordable."
1,"I had a disappointing experience at soy street. The staff appeared disengaged, lacked enthusiasm, and did not offer a welcoming demeanor.

I ordered the Chicken Miso Ramen, which was far from fresh and caused immediate stomach discomfort. When I raised my concern with the chef, he seemed dismissive and showed no willingness to acknowledge the issue, let alone offer an apology.

Additionally, there was no effort made towards basic service recovery, which was quite disappointing. I hope the management takes this feedback seriously and works on improving both food quality and customer service."
5,"If you‚Äôre a fan of authentic South Indian cuisine, Malgudi is a must-visit QSR (Quick Service Restaurant) that brings the taste of the south to your plate with both flavor and flair !!

We recently had the pleasure of trying their offerings, and I must say, it‚Äôs one of the best tiffin-style experiences in town !!

Idli ‚Äì Soft, fluffy, and served with a variety of chutneys and piping hot sambar !!
A classic done right !!

Masala Dosa ‚Äì Crispy golden perfection on the outside, filled with a perfectly spiced potato masala !!
It‚Äôs comfort food at its finest !!

Pav Bhaji ‚Äì A pleasant surprise on the menu !!
The bhaji was rich and flavorful, and the pav was toasted just right !!

Appam with Malabar Curry Tiffin ‚Äì This was the showstopper !!
The appams were soft and lacy, perfectly complementing the creamy, aromatic Malabar curry !!

Sweet Pongal ‚Äì A delightful ending to the meal !!
It had just the right amount of sweetness and a generous touch of ghee and nuts !!

Enjoy their Buy One Get One Free Every Tuesday !!
An unbeatable deal that makes your favorite tiffin meals even more enjoyable !!

5,"I loved the taste of the dishes here, too good! Highly recommend you to have meals here. I ordered:

-idli vada tiffin
-benne masala podi dosa (must try)
-masala paper dosa
-podi ghee idli (must try)
-benne sada dosa"
5,"At malgudi we finally tried the Benne dosa's which were crispy and loaded with butter. New dishes have been added in their menu like the podi idli, benne dosa, podi masala benne dosa, filter coffee and much more. I absolutely loved the filter coffee. All dosas and idli will served with freshly made chutney and sambar.
Dishes that we tried were:

Benne podi masala dosa
Mysore masala dosa
Pav bhaji
Filter coffee and pineapple sheera

I would highly recommend their pineapple sheera as well. The presentation of all the dishes wear on point. The portion of  masala in the dosa's can be improved. Prices are little on a higher side but the quality is good. Overall we had a great experience."
5,I had sheera and filter coffee at malgudi. Both were really good.  Ms Akansha was prompt and active in her service too.
5,"Loved the benne podi plain dosa. Perfectly crispy on the outside, soft and spongy inside, with delicious podi. Very tasty chutneys on the side too."
4,"I am a Thai Food lover and try to find good places to eat as such. When you enter this place, you will observe it is very small (cozy though) and quiet (a perfect place to peacefully eat food). The food is not bad at all. In fact it is nice. The menu is small but powerful. The staff is great. The captain knows exactly what each dish is made of and tastes like. If in confusion, ask the staff to suggest a dish and you will not be disappointed.
The seating arrangement is very European (meaning - Tables are placed very close to each other)"
1,Chicken was not fresh atall very disappointed
1,Please avoid the food tastes of ajinomoto or MSG
5,Japanese udon noodles with seafood was the bestest item from their menu ‚ù§
5,Black pepper noodles and drums of heaven are must try items over here .. love the quality and quantity both ..
1,"The staff is friendly, but prices are skyrocketing. I used to love this place for its great pure veg burgers, but with the steep price hikes, I can no longer afford them. Sadly, I‚Äôll have to switch to American burger outlets that aren‚Äôt purely vegetarian"
4,"I'm a total burger enthusiast! I've tried almost every variety, and I must say, they're all amazingly delicious and affordable.

But what really steals the show is their chocolate and Oreo shake - it's absolute perfect."
4,"Good food,value for money,great service and best burgers on the go"
5,Good nice crisp veg patty for burgers. French fries were awesome! Value for money.
5,"This is the only branch of Jumbo King in all over india where everything is just perfect üíØ I have been to Andheri, Vile Parle, Dadar and many but this Churchgate branch is so amazing like great customer service and staff are also so good with very positive attitude they remember every visits and they literally know about their each and every customer's favourite meals ‚ù§Ô∏è really appreciated and üíØ recommend"
5,"We had an amazing dinner experience at The Rooftop by Yogi Executive! The ambiance was stunning, with breathtaking views of the city skyline. The rooftop setting was beautifully designed, with cozy seating areas and elegant decor.The service was top-notch! Our server was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu. The staff ensured that we had everything we needed throughout the evening.
Now, onto the food ‚Äì it was incredible! We ordered a variety of dishes, and each one was expertly prepared and presented. The flavors were bold, and the portions were generous.
Overall, our dinner experience at The Rooftop by Yogi Executive was exceptional. We highly recommend it for special occasions or just a night out with friends and family. We can't wait to go back!
Highlights:* Stunning views, excellent service, delicious food, elegant ambiance.

Will we return?: Absolutely!"
5,"My husband & I had a wonderful time at rooftop yogi executive. Jishna made all the arrangements on a short notice. The food & ambience is good. Good service as well. The staff is humble, caring & well spoken. Do visit this place."
2,"We visited this restaurant to celebrate a special occasion with my family. It was a spontaneous decision since it‚Äôs a rooftop restaurant, and we‚Äôve had positive experiences at other Yogi outlets before.

To begin with, we were not offered poolside seating despite it being available. Although, after visiting the washroom, I noticed the pool wasn‚Äôt particularly clean.

The area where we were seated had excessively loud music. While I‚Äôve been to pubs before, the sound here was harsh and uncomfortable, likely due to poor-quality speakers or improper sound equalizer settings. The volume was so high that the waiter could barely hear us while taking our order.

Feeling uncomfortable due to the overwhelming noise, we decided to order quickly and leave as soon as possible. I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder why we weren‚Äôt seated outside, despite specifically requesting it.

When our food finally arrived, it was disappointing. The service was terrible ‚Äî they initially brought only the chicken crispy, and after a long wait, they served the biryani. Two of our starters were still pending at this point, and eventually, they brought garlic bread and fish fingers along with the main course, which was a bizarre combination.

We quickly finished our meal and left. The service charge was optional, and considering the poor service, I asked them to remove it.

After this experience, I have no intention of visiting this Yogi outlet again."
2,"Ambience and music is good. Food quality is average. Prices are a bit high. Service very poor but service charge is ten percent. But remember to negotiate on service charge, they will discount it. Overall average experience."
1,"‚≠ê 1/5

**Terrible Experience!**

The food at *The Roof Top Yogi Exclusive* was the worst I've ever had. The fish was smelly, the portions were ridiculously small, and the prices were unreasonably high. The ambience was awful‚Äîextremely loud music, a mosquito infestation, and zero effort in making the place comfortable. On top of that, the service was terrible‚Äîwe waited over 25 minutes for our food! Definitely not worth the time or money. Avoid this place."
3,its in inorbit mall the combo was good worth the price pizza was good but the garlic bread is the worst rest is good
2,"Tried Garlic bread, it was looking tempting.

But didn‚Äôt taste good, it was an flop show.

Hope other products are good."
3,I tried Mexican chicken kebab strombilli here. It was overpriced and the taste was not up to the mark. Definitely not recommended.
5,"Nice pizza üçï with great taste and value for money üòã when you're more than one person, best option to select combo meals, it's really good to have pizza üçï soft drinks and garlic bread"

1,"Complaint Regarding Service at McDonald‚Äôs (Bill No. 253) 9:20 pm

Dear McDonald‚Äôs Team,

I recently placed an order at your inorbit outlet with Bill No. 253. I had specifically requested a ‚Äúno ice‚Äù cold drink and takeaway. However, the staff did not follow this request. When I asked about my order, I was met with angry looks, and the staff packed the order in a very messy manner.

Additionally, I had ordered peri peri seasoning, but it was missing from my bag despite being included in my order. This is highly disappointing as I noticed the issue only after leaving the outlet.

I kindly request you to address these service lapses and take steps to ensure better experiences for customers in the future.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
Sweksha"
4,"One of my favourite McDonald's restaurants. I gave 4* because there's no dedicated sitting arrangement for customers of McDonald's and you need to sit in the food court. Otherwise it's a great place.
Parking available in the shopping center (paid parking lot)."
5,This outlet of McDonald's is situated in Inorbit mall in Vashi. Food is good and there is a lot of tables to sit outside. Service is fast. Overall good place to order and enjoy with friends
2,"Disappointing Experience at McDonald's, Inorbit Mall Vashi

I visited this outlet yesterday and was left underwhelmed. Unfortunately, the fries were served cold, and the service was subpar.

To make matters worse, the burger lacked flavor and failed to meet my expectations. As a customer, I hope for better quality food and service from a renowned brand like McDonald's.

I hope you'll take my feedback seriously and take necessary steps to improve the food quality and service standards at this outlet."
2,"It was a bad experience me.I had ordered and was waiting for my order number to be displayed. But it didn't get displayed for more than 20 mins. So, I went there and asked about my order. Then they said that my order was ready
I had ordered mc puff and cappuccino and they both are not hot.
Service is really so bad. Disappointed!"
5,"Nice blend of food, drinks, ambiance and service. Prices are reasonable. However drink and food options are various.
Food is delicious served by kind and polite staff. A high stool as well as sofa sitting is available. This bar was silent (no music) however multiple televisions functioned on mute (mainly displaying cricket).
St
If you are not sure what to eat, do request help from the staff. They will genuinely help with your cravings with the best dish possible.
Food preparation is mouth watering and satisfying, combined with a favourite drink and it is one kind of experience.
The place is comfortable for ladies as well.
Parking is available in front of the hotel. Parking space is a bit limited. During weekends parking can be little time consuming, however valet parking is also provided by the hotel so no worries for the packing."
1,"The portion sizes were small, and the taste was merely average. While everything else was fine, this place is definitely not recommended for true food lovers. The menu highlighted the lemon chilli crispy chicken as a bestseller, but it turned out to be the worst dish we tried. It didn‚Äôt even resemble crispy chicken we usually find in good restaurant."
4,"Dropped by this wonderful place in vashi for the weekend party with my gang!
This place is located in inorbit mall which is really a plus as the inorbit mall is at a jump distance from the station.
Talking about the decor this place has trippy lights all over and the seating arena is phenomenal too! Comfy couches and high chairs to chill!
Coming to the food and beverages,
The bar here is full stocked serving some great cocktails and mocktails. We tried few of them and we really were impressed with the taste and the beautiful creation done by the mixologist.
In food department this one was superb too.
We had chicken schezwan fried rice which was really well made and had generous chicken and egg portions. Loved this one.
Chilli garlic noodles // thin noodles which were well tossed in sauces and lovely presentation too. It was on a spicier side too.
In appetizers,
We had chicken lollipop. Served in 6 pieces and lovely taste however the presentation could have been better. But the taste took everything ahead.
Murgh Hyderabadi tikka was the call for second appetizer, 6 pieces were served and well presented too. The texture was soft and tender. Served with mint chutney!
In drinks we had following,
Tropical LIIT
It is the better option and a nice change of pace if you find your self in LIIT, It was made pleasantly with Pineapple Juice and Mix of Alcohol.
Mandarin Mojito
A normal Mojito with a hint of fresh Orange.
Garnish with mint leaves and orange wedges would recommend!
Beer LIIT
A normal LIIT which replaced Coke with beer, the taste was phenomenal. A refreshing drink for beer lovers.
Blueberry mojito
A virgin mojito with a great mix of blueberry squash in it. Loved this alotttt! A great drink for non alcoholics.
Overall loved this place a lot and would genuinely recommend to others of you are looking for something in vashi with exquisite decor and proper club vibes."
3,Food was decent but grossly overpriced. At least two drinks which were chosen from the menu were not avaliable. Service was polite but extremely slow. A costly and ordinary experience.
5,Excellent place. Recco by a friend and we loved the ambience and the vibe. Highly recommend. Try their special cocktails which btw have quite a bit of spirit per drinküòä so go slow n enjoy ü•Ç
1,"The donuts were HORRIBLE!!!
I don't think I've tasted any worse.
They looked good on the outside, but the donut bread was tasteless, very dry, and the icing was anything but icing..
Please improve the quality, I gave service 3 star not coz they were bad but bcz they could have easily informed us that the donuts were either old or dry or stale.
They looked super so we ended up buying them, but don't get fooled by the look!
Waste of 650 Rs."
5,"Mad over donuts an unique store to have variety of donuts in very reasonable prices. Donut üç© lovers can always explore variety of products as per their taste buds.
Time to time, there are offers to attract buyers, like currently buy three and get three is a great offer."
1,"Bought mini donuts from MOD (Inorbit Mall, Vashi) and they were disappointing - old, flaky, and not the same quality as before. Wish I had checked before leaving the store. Paid full price, but the freshness wasn‚Äôt there. If you're buying from here, check before you pay!"
4,"A good MOD outlet pertaining to service and friendly staff. The MOD donuts are anyways always tasty and mouth watering. The have all varieties of the donuts, waffles and eclairs ranges that the other outlets have which is a good thing. Must visit if you are inorbit mall,  Vashi and have a sweet tooth. Over all a good outlet hence four stars."
4,"Best Place To Have Doughnuts Its located in Food court of inorbit Mall, Vashi.
They have Wide seating arrangement of Food Court . Varieties and Offer Are the best specially if you are Gold member then Its The bestest .

1,"1/5 Stars - Disappointing Sunday Brunch Experience*

We visited this place for Sunday brunch, expecting a delightful experience. Unfortunately, the service was disappointing. Despite having multiple staff members, nobody attended to our table for an extended period. It seemed like they were too busy catering to larger groups.

The menu boasted an impressive 70+ dishes, but the vegetarian options in the main course were severely limited, with only 4 choices. The food was cold.
But the most disturbing aspect of our experience was finding a cockroach on the buffet display. This is unacceptable and raises serious concerns about the restaurant's hygiene and food safety standards.

Overall, our Sunday brunch experience was a disaster. With poor service, limited vegetarian options, cold food, and a cockroach infestation, we would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.

1,it was the worst experience ever. on 30th December 2023I went for a buffet. to my surprise the starter was not ready. food quality was really bad. I keep continuously asking the attendant guy when it would serve because I was waiting for more then 30 mi. and to my surprise he was coffee n having snacks. and when I starter came he served few and kept it in the corner and he had few of them . i was so shocked and I started arguing with him . I said I will post in the social media. and he was okay with that. then the manager came and he reduced my bill to 840 n said sorry. the desert was also not fresh. I would like to request Zomato and swiggy pls remove this name   from the restaurant list. I have posted few images u people can see the quality of the food. Please don't visit this restaurant if you don't want to spoil your mood .
1,"Today I visited the Curry N Spice Restaurent.While booking in the menu they showed me something after visiting there they served something.There is only 10% food which they mention in the menu.We ask the on of the staff who are there why this is totally different which you mention in the Swiggy.We ask them they said no this is our menu.

One more thing they showed slot time is 12:00 but they started at 1:00 PM I planned according to my flight time today.

Totally disappointed with this incident."
1,"Went for a team dinner, first off manager is rude, the service was very very slow almost all food arrived cold, the servers did an exceptionally bad job in serving to our plates, unequal portions distributed.

Staffs is good
Must visits here ."
5,"They have the most affordable and tastiest snacks in vashi.

Never heard about it, hence decided to try it.
Something new and very tasty.
Nice Ambience and service is good,
Overall nice experience.
They provide discount cards so that for your next visit, you pay 10 to 15% less than total bill.

One issue from this restaurant is that they provide you mineral water without asking you and charge you for that."
4,It was a cozy place. The food was very tasty and to be honest their quantity of food is amazing. Loved the Lucknowi Sheekh. It was mouthwatering. It had cheese filling in the middle which was complimenting the taste üëçüèª biryani was okay. I felt the rice could have been cooked a little more. The chicken gravy so delicious and the quantity was so much that couldn‚Äôt finish it. Overall enjoyed the food. And the bill was quite reasonable!
5,A small AC restaurant near Vashi station. Serves moderate Chinese food. Our order was rice platter which costed us 400 bucks. It had 4 varieties of rice and coke. Rice varieties were good. One yellow rice was little bit sweetish.
3,"a average taste and overpriced as the rates are of fine dine menu, we ordered lollypop and the pieces were very small (tiny) also no one was there inside AC room to take order, we came out and shout to give order then one person attended our order, rest it's okayish type"
1,Very worst food in my life I eat..and services also.. don't suggest this shope for anyone
3,"Situated outside Vashi Railway Station, this is a good option for quick Chinese and Indian food.. We liked the White Tandoori Chicken along with Tawa Chicken for main course.. Chinese dishes are also good.. Somehow I liked Indian food over Chinese at this joint.. Seating is fine and Service is quick.. Though it's not an upscale place, it's definitely worth a visit.."
5,Almost everything in chinese is tasty. And indian cuisine too.. Very affordable rates. Recently renovated. Non air-conditioned restaurant. But good for group celebrations/treats. decent ambiance. Must check this out
3,Since 2010 this restaurant was established. Veg and none veg dishes and value combo packs are available. This restaurant opens at 9 a.m. and closes at 11 pm. All dishes are the testy and cheap rate. free home delivery.
3,"Name -  Chopking

Address - 10D, near Vashi railway station, Vashi(5mins walkable distance from station)

Working hours - Monday to Sunday 11am to 11.30pm

Ambience - Non - AC, open enclosure, I will rate 2.5.

Food - Tough the name suggests it's a Chinese cuisine serving restaurant,. It serves wide variety of food like south indian, Punjabi, Maharashtrian etc. I will rate 3.5 for food.

What's good- Just 5 minutes away from Vashi railway station. You can vouch for it for quick bite to lunch/dinner. Service is fast and food is good.

Need to work on- Not suitable to dine in during summer or hot days. You will feel the heat due to open enclosure from one end. No music/TV installed to depend on your company for entertainment.

Nearby places to explore - Raghuleela mall, Hypercity mall are just 5 mins walk away. There are also similar dhaba type restaurants around.

Pricing - pricing is moderate. Around 400 - 550 for 2. I will rate 3.5.

Card payment - Yes"
1,Not recommended. We ordered butter chicken and naan here and the chicken was not at all fresh. Even after complaining about the matter the owner did not replace the item or gave any exception on bill.
5,"Just had a massive idli for breakfast, and wow!  It was seriously jumbo-sized.  The coconut chutney was perfect with it.  One of these was totally enough to fill me up.  So good and satisfying. Definitely a great way to start the day.  I'm already looking forward to having another one.  Highly recommend it if you're looking for a yummy and filling breakfast!"
5,This is a very good jumbo idli. I used to take this for tiffin to school from 5th class to 10th class. That is why I liked this jumbo tiffin very much. That is why I am giving it 5 stars.
3,"They have good jumbo idli, even 1 is sufficient to end the hunger. The size of idli is really good but only problem is slowly they have started degrading the quality of chutney."
5,"We are eating these idli since 1999.
Chatni is too good.
Till today they maintain quality and taste,"
5,The Best Jumbo Idli at cost effective Price around Turbhe .. and you will love the Ice Chutney along with it
3,"The restaurant was average, with nothing special about the food‚Äîit was just like what every other restaurant offers.

The mango lassi was good.

However, the service needs improvement; it took 10 minutes for the additional roti to arrive"
5,"Superior quality food with great taste. Service is also good. Traditional ambience with little congested seating. A Sabji can serve 3-4 persons. Prices are super premium justified with their food taste.

For parking you need to take hotel staff assistance. The location is just a little inside the main road."
5,"While returning from Mumbai to Pune, we had pleasure to dine in at Original and Famous Bhagat Tarachand near APMC market, Vashi.

This is the branch of original Bhagat Tarachand at Kalbadevi, Mumbai which is in existence & very popular since 1895 (can you believe 130 years). This is so popular veg restaurant offering simple but very tasty veg food for lunch & dinner that now I believe there are multiple restaurants with prefix from A to Z (mainly restaurants with same names started by offshoots of original Bhagat Tarachand) in Mumbai.

But we found original is original. The restaurant had minimalistic decore, very clean atmosphere and very tasty food. Papad Churi, Ghee Tadkewali Dal, ghee coated fulka, Sev Tamata, Lasuni Methi, the dishes which made Bhagat Tarachand famous were available here and exactly the same we ordered. Each dish was very very tasty (it is so tasty that we ended up eating 2-3 additional fulkas for dinner).

Serving delicious Chhas (butter milk) in beer bottle was started by Bhagat Tarachand, a tradition, which they still maintain and we definitely were not going to go against tradition and hence enjoyed chass in beer bottle (1 full 650/750 ml of thick Chhas per person). The Chhas was so delicious and fresh that we did not even had to sprinkle chhat masala on top. After gulping down one full bottle of delicious Chhas or butter milk, we realised by Chhas in Kachh region of Gujarat is called Kachhi Beer (‡§ï‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡•Ä ‡§¨‡§ø‡§Ö‡§∞).

Another great item (which I believe no other restaurant in world serves) was Papad Churi. Papad Churi here is really amazing and I was told that people come here mainly to enjoy papad Churi and also take packed papad Churi home after lunch / dinner.

Overall, our experience of original Bhagat Tarachand was really amazing and this branch of Bhagat Tarachand restaurant really lived upto its reputation and we also now understand why original Bhagat Tarachand is thriving since last 130 years and why there are so many namesake restaurants with same name with prefix.

We ended up having so much in dinner that we had to toss up to decide who is going to drive back to Pune after dinner (as everyone wanted to have comfortable sleep on way back home)."
5,"This is one of the worst oldest Restaurant, Since 1895 and they have maintained the quality and taste. It is really a great place to have some good food."
5,"Bhagat Tarachand in Sanpada is a popular choice for authentic North Indian and Gujarati cuisine.

I‚Äôd rate it a solid 5 stars for the exceptional taste and quality of the food. The flavors are rich, and the dishes like dal fry, paneer tikka, and churma laddoo truly stand out. The freshness and authenticity of each dish make it a delightful experience for anyone looking to indulge in delicious vegetarian fare.

However, when it comes to service and pricing, it falls slightly short, earning a 4-star rating in my opinion. The restaurant tends to get very crowded, especially during peak hours, leading to longer wait times not just for a table but even for ordering an extra roti or rice. The service staff, while polite, often seems overwhelmed, which impacts the overall dining experience.

Additionally, the pricing feels a bit on the higher side given the portion sizes. For the price paid, the quantity could be more generous. Despite these minor setbacks, Bhagat Tarachand remains a must-visit for food lovers who prioritize taste and quality over service speed.

5,"Very different type of Punjabi Sindhi food is served here the air condition family section is comfortable for sitting. Ambience is very basic. Pricing is also very moderate service is quick and attend. You portion size is served as per the pricing are more than value for money. all the dishes in the menu are prepared in a different their style of preparation, but for trying and very tasty and delicious over and above the food is not much heavy on stomach, you get multiple options of roti like Tandoor roti, Tava roti, Chapati, and many more."
4,Food here is really good. They have both AC and non AC seating. Resonably priced i would say. Being here handfull of times. Will recommend if you are near by the market place. Basundi is must try!
2,The staff was quite impolite.. the pricing shown online price & menu available offline was very different also the presentation or serving wasn‚Äôt good.. taste & quantity was ok ok.. but
4,"This is in MAFCO Market, food is delicious and low rate, where do u find gravy‚Äôs at 90rs. It‚Äôs punjabi special restaurant with not so luxurious ambiance which means u can find waiters not in uniform but service is quick. Ambiance is simple like a normal hotel but food taste and price range is affordable. You have many restaurants in this area but this is near the road. You have family section which has less tables and many times there is queue."
1,This is not a North Indian restaurant... Don't eat this food... Go to GTB (Guru Tegh Bahadur Nagar) for North Indian Punjabi taste... They just lost a regular customer.. The parents were running the restaurant better ü§¨
5,"Good food, the service was excellent. Menu has a variety of dishes to choose from. The South Indian food was amazing. We tried Dosa and Uttapam which were great. The restaurant was clean. Parking was easy to find (pay n park was right outside)"
5,"A good restaurant, pure veg , located near Vashi railway station

The taste of food is good, jain options are available too
Service is fast and great"
5,"I had a wonderful experience at Cafe Vihar! The ambience was fantastic ‚Äì clean, cozy, and perfect for a relaxed meal. The food was absolutely delicious and exceeded our expectations. We tried the Veg Hyderabadi, which was packed with flavors, and the chapati was soft and fresh. What made it even better was how affordable everything was. This place offers great quality at reasonable prices. Highly recommended for anyone looking for tasty vegetarian food!"
5,"The atmosphere gives feelings of class. As per food, quality, staff, and service ambiance should upgrade. I love how it's beautifully lightened. Also, they can improvise the menu by adding Vegan smoothies and recipes, which create a sense of cafe term too. Always love to visit."
4,Food is good in taste with lots of varieties for vegetarians. They serve Jain food as well. The staff is polite. If you want quick service then reach by 12.30 pm else it will be very crowded by 1 pm

5,"I recently visited KFC Powai and had a very satisfying experience. The outlet is conveniently located and easy to spot, especially if you're looking for a quick meal around Hiranandani Gardens. The ambience is casual and comfortable‚Äîperfect for a relaxed lunch or dinner with friends or even a solo bite.

The staff was courteous and prompt. I placed my order through the self-service kiosk, which was smooth and hassle-free. The food was served fresh and hot within a reasonable time. I went with the classic Zinger Burger combo and Hot & Crispy chicken pieces, and they didn‚Äôt disappoint. The chicken was juicy inside with the perfect crunch on the outside. Their fries were crisp and well-seasoned too.

The outlet maintained good hygiene, and I appreciated that the tables were cleaned promptly after each customer. One small downside is that the seating area can get a bit cramped during peak hours, especially on weekends. It‚Äôs manageable, but you might have to wait a few minutes to find a spot if it‚Äôs crowded.

Overall, KFC Powai offers the consistent taste and quality you expect from the brand, with decent service and a clean environment. It‚Äôs a great go-to place if you‚Äôre in the mood for fried chicken or a quick, satisfying meal.

Would definitely recommend this outlet to fellow KFC lovers in the Powai area!"
5,"I was in a hurry and recieved the best service from kfc staff in hiranandani. I wish i had asked for his name becoz he deserves a big thanks.

The place still has the deserted look...most of the chairs and tables are still staked and kept at one corner....they have kept temp scanner and hand sanitizer at the entry for visitor's safety....n one guy is deployed for doing the test... hopefully the place will gain it's old Glory n crowd soon... regarding taste the place seriously need the catch up with its original flavour ...the stuff I tried was almost ripped of its original flavour n contents ....

Update 22 Dec 2024

The place is glowing with all its glory now.
We tried their new wraps which we already tasted at a new KFC outlet on NH48 few days back, somehow it seems it dint tasted as fresh at it was in the other outlet , anyway maybe some issue with their kitchen rest it's a cool place."
2,"One of the worst KFC‚Äôs I have ever been to.
1. The first ever KFC which said they don‚Äôt have any paper tissues.
2. Forget about visits the bathroom. You can‚Äôt even enter the room due to the strong smell.
3. The staff stays with you the whole time while your order from the kiosk, keeping a hand over the POS machine, so that they can enter their phone number for the order instead of your own.

Overall the worst experience from a KFC and highly recommend everyone to NOT visit this place."
3,"To start with the positive things, the location, service and the ambience are impeccable. When it comes to the main part, the buffet and the grills could have been better.
They have live counters and a variety of cocktails and mocktails. There are seatings available for almost all group sizes. Some of the dishes were more oily and spicier. The chicken and fish ones were a must try."
5,"One of the best Buffets from barbecue point.
Must say Food is way much better than the Barbeque Nation and Abs BBQ in Powai.
Starters are great and they do have good bar card.
Suggestion to have tap beers with offers at least for lunch.
Mains too have many varieties and selections.
Best part is the desert Nd their service
Booking the place is MUST.
Valet parking available"
4,"2months ago visit
Visited after long and was pleasantly surprised by the food quality which is very good , Endless starters , good tasting main course and of course desert was very good. The key is to have tummy space for main course n deserts. Sunday rush was well managed.  Menu in pic"
5,"This restaurant is one of our top choices for corporate dining. It‚Äôs located in a great neighborhood, surrounded by breweries and shopping spots, which adds to the overall experience. The ambiance is elegant yet welcoming, making it a comfortable space for both casual meetings and more formal client lunches or dinners.

The food is excellent, with a wide variety of options to suit different tastes and preferences. Service is professional and attentive, ensuring a smooth dining experience every time. It‚Äôs also a great spot to bring international clients‚Äîthey always appreciate the quality and the setting. Highly recommended for business dining and casual outings alike."
4,We had booked the slot for 2:30pm but we reached by 3pm. So we were told the buffet will end by 3:30 so we had to quickly gobble everything up. Food was delicious. Only the time frame limit thing is something we didn't like. Perfect place for foodies. Loved the grilled starters specially the chicken momos.
5,"I got cravings for Chole Bhature, so I walked almost 2 km to get here from my location. But the food and service made it all worth the effort.

The restaurant was clean, the staff were friendly, and even the owner/cashier was welcoming.

Now, about the food my god, the bhaturas were massive and more than enough for me, while the cholas were incredibly soft and packed with flavorful masalas. To top it all off, they served onions and a wedge of lemon, which was perfect. üòö

I ended the meal with a lassi, and it was so thick you couldn‚Äôt even drink it with a straw, absolutely delightful!

The prices were also very reasonable, especially considering Mumbai standards."
1,"A truly disappointing experience. The food was awful, lacking both taste and quality. To make matters worse, the staff completely ignored our concerns when we raised complaints. The owner showed no accountability for the subpar food and service, leaving us feeling frustrated. Definitely not worth visiting."
3,"It's a nice hotel.
This is second time I am visiting this hotel for lunch.
This time I had pav bhaji and chocolate milkshake which was very good in taste.
They have very cool pictures on the wall.
They also having parking.
Hotel is very clean and hygiene.
It's was really awesome experience to visit here."
1,I ordered paneer masala and the taste was the worst they use the same base gravy which had burned aftertaste and the buttermilk was water not buttermilk so the worst food according to me
5,"This is the Best hotel for a good food at bare minimum price. The Food is  full value for money. The ambiance is also quit good with bright lights.One can enjoy Indian , Chinese and Punjabi food at this place. The best thing is that it suits your pocket as well as Budget. I would personally recommend to enjoy the good food at Laxmi hotel. The staff is so supportive and hospitable. Love this place so much."
5,"Always our go to place, since we work right next to it, it's always conveneint & they serve just well.
Food: Great food any time. Must try their burgers and nachos, they're really good.
Have heard a lot about their Biryani being really amazing, so can give that a shot too. My favourite is the Pina Colada. It never fails ;)
Ambience: It's a decently sized place with enough seating for quite a few groups & there are special seatings as well as a special seating area. There's always good music playing. Loved the minimalistic decor they have, with a book rack & some quirky items there.
They've painted across the walls right from the staircase so it's pretty interesting.
Service: Really good :)
They have a great menu for everyone & its suits the pocket well. So must visit."
2,"Only positive is the food rest everything disappointing !!

The sofa seatings are useless with overhead dripping water from AC vents. The waiters are very rude and bring the hospitality to the lowest. They are perhaps on a cost cutting budget and do not switch on the lights untill sunset and complete dark.

Food: 3.5/5
Ambience : 2/5
Service : 1/5
Value for money: 3/5"
4,"During my visit to Mumbai, India.This is my first visit at this place coming with my family. First impression looking the entrance of the building was not impressive. But once you come to the Thyme bristro, it is different classy looks. It is good deal for Rs299 BUFFET. Started with Tomyum veg soup (little spicy for me). Starter - Chilly chicken, main course - Chicken Schezwan chicken, chicken kadai (which was awesome) jeera rice, dal kadai, veg hakka noodles, veg dewani handi, Gobi mutter and bread options. The hospitality of the staff was very courteous and polite. I would suggest this place a perfect outing and eating place for family lunch. Also being a lounge, you can have drinks in the afternoon but charged separately."
5,Awesome place to hangout. Food is excellent. Music also perfect. And they have offers on some drinks.
5,"Good ambience and cool music aswell.
Nice place to chill out with friends"
3,"Declining Experience: A Once Memorable Restaurant Falls Short on Second Visit

First Visit: A Delightful and Authentic Experience

I had a satisfying experience during my first visit a year ago. Every single dish offered a unique, authentic taste, and the staff was highly professional, attentive, and decent. It was a memorable dining experience that stood out for its quality food and excellent service.

Second Visit: A Disappointing Decline

Unfortunately, my second visit was a complete letdown. The service was underwhelming and felt forced, with the staff not offering the same level of attention and professionalism. The food quality was highly disappointing. The dishes that were once memorable and authentic now seemed lackluster, and the overall taste was far from what I remembered. The food was only affordable if you were extremely hungry, as the quality didn‚Äôt justify the cost.

Food Quality and Value:

While the quantity of food was decent considering the price, the overall experience did not match the standard I had previously enjoyed. The North Indian dishes, which stood out during my first visit, now lacked the same unique and authentic flavors. Despite the lower cost compared to nearby dining options, the decline in quality and satisfaction was noticeable and disappointing.

Final Thoughts:

It‚Äôs unfortunate to see such a dramatic decline in both the service and food quality over just a year. What was once a place I looked forward to visiting is now a spot I would hesitate to return to. The restaurant needs to pay attention to these issues if they hope to regain the positive reputation they once had in my mind."
1,"Absolutely disgusting food, do not even try ,
I would give -10 stars, overpriced for the horrible food they provide.

Misal pav , is cold and bad
Chicken sandwich has bland cold boiled chicken inside,
Vadapav doesn't do justice to mumbai"
5,"My son has his birthday party at Gulmohar. Everything was excellent. The staff were wonderful, food tasted great, and they were very accommodating to our needs. Will definitely do this again."
1,I just ordered paneer kungpao‚Ä¶ it was the worst.. paneer was stale after eating just little bit I felt like Vomating. Paneer was not fresh at all.. waste of money.
5,Always a good spot for a snack fix on a tight schedule. Their hospitality game is on point and they never disappoint their regulars. 10/10 would eat here again üòä
1,"BAD QUALITY FOOD AND SERVICE

Extremely bad quality food and service. Received completely UNCOOKED RAW CHICKEN TANDOORI from this takeout corner. Even replacement order was tasteless and bad quality. Waste of time and money."
5,Cheftoon good food tandoori delicious one of the best food made here
4,This place take only take away orders. All types of veg and non veg dishes available. Taste of food is delicious. Quality and quantity is nice. Famous for Chinese & chicken dishes. Rates are normal and pocket friendly. They accept cash & card üí≥ payments also. No parking due to crowded road & road touch location.
5,"Veg Thai curry rice is recommended. So is their Dal fry. While ordering from the app, toy get points, which get translated to ‚Çπ1 each point as discount for next orders. their packaging is leak proof, and the food is prepared fresh. The staff is kind and prompt in taking orders. Home delivery takes some time, but is definitely worth the wait."
4,"Hey all
Have ordered  yesterday chicken Rare, were boneless Chicken is not properly cooked as well as quantity is very less and even chiken piece is also very small.
Not properly cook..i order Last 3yers same place but naver every seen ....
Check ande order .."
5,"We wished to visit Mejwani last week, but that‚Äôs when we got to know that it‚Äôs shut on one weekday. The restaurant has Great service. Amazing flavours in food. Quick service time. Good portion size.
I would highly recommend the dishes we enjoyed - Mushroom Crispy & Chicken Crispy."
5,"I have been at this place multiple times from the last 5 years, and one thing I would like to highlight is the Food Quality and Taste is constant over years. One can have both veg and especially Non veg,,üòÄüòÄüëç without any hesitation. They won't let you down in terms of food quality, taste and quantity.
The cost is very efficient in comparison to other restaurants  in nearby localities. The staff is also very humble and greets people very well."
4,Paradise for malwani food lovers. Also good for Punjabi and Chinese food. The dine has been renovated recently and has a cozy ambience. Quantity and quality of food served is good. This place is little small with smaller dinning tables. Made to ordered dishes are served fast then the fix thalis. Otherwise the service is prompt. Usually during the lunch time there is more rush and you may have to wait for a table. Hygiene is good.
4,It's a nice place with good quality of food and ambience. I think it's the only restaurant nearby Lodha commercial complex where you guys can enjoy your team lunch or causal meetings.
1,The worst hotel ever. The food there is average and price is too much. Too overrated and manager only care about money. When complained he said 'You just pay the bill. These many peoples are eating are not fools'. Worst experience ever and food taste is average and quantity is too less.
3,Good food but has a lot of colour added in shazwan
1,"I was going to these restaurants. I take it that this is a Hindu restaurant, but I can not go there the next time because the cook is Muslims Because these people were extremely filthy and unkempt."
1,Have ordered some food it was worst not cooked and the rice was stinky
1,Can I give them zero star..they are just worst in service ..cheap persons
5,I don‚Äôt think this restaurant is test better
1,"I had a disappointing experience with my recent order. While the burgers were enjoyable, the wings were excessively oily, and one appeared overcooked, which was quite concerning. I hope this can be addressed for future customers."
4,"Local burger joint near at kanjur-Marg station and opposite to Huma talkies. This is a small outlet but the quality of food serves is extremely good. There are so many   in both veg & non veg. but if you have large appetite, then chicken cheese burger (they have even  2-3 varieties of these) in black bun is way to go!"
4,"My brother recommended this place, he was here in 2015. He suggested we should try this after a long time.
So we dined here with our friend. We had a great time.
We had an aloo tikki burger and chicken bbq burger.
I liked the chicken bbq burger very much.  It was delicious. They have so many branches in Mumbai.
Very pocket friendly cafe near KanjurMarg station.
The staff was also good and the cafe should've been a bit larger than it seems. But yeah if you are a foodie you must give it a try."
3,"i have tried Aloo Tikki Cheese and Mixed Veggie Cheese which were quite good in taste.
The place is very small but they serves variety of burgers at reasonable prices with good quality and services are quick. Overall its a good experience but they should improvise little on taste then it will be perfect."
4,I have ordered food online from this place a few times and have had a very good experience. The menu is decently priced and the taste of the food is good. The barbecue chicken burger is one i would recommend. The place is very small with very uncomfortable seating arrangement. I'd suggest you order from this place instead.

4,Nice as you can see....
1,"I hated this place......question would be why ? I in a team dinner ordered a chicken lollypop which is no challenge to make ryt. i don't know what Bater they used to dip the chicken wings but tasted like gram flour chicken lollypop pakoda....one star definitely for the food and beverage guys ...

Thanks"
1,"Worst food ever had. NAAM BADE DARSHAN CHOTE. No quality, no taste and no value for money."
2,Average food and decent ambience.
5,It not only has McDonald's food but it also has mccafe which gives a lot of varieties in cappuccino and latte. The Ambience is way better than any other McDonald's. The hygiene level of Cafe is good. Nice place.
5,"One of a great ambiance and taste of food. I loved the food and services. It is quite rare for the customer to be relaxed in any fast food corner, But here it was different. Do visit if you wanna try tasty burgers and combo platters. üòä‚úåüèªüôåüèªüòã"
5,"This place is situated at Neptune Mall and is a very large space for Cafe and perfect for working or  meeting bunch of friends.

Why you should visit this place
It's closer to station
Has small and large tables to fit your group size
The hygiene level of Cafe is good
It not only has McDonald's food but it also has mccafe which gives a lot of varieties in cappuccino and latte
It has Metro store next to it so in case if you want to shop groceries or any other item you can easily visit the shop also
The cafe is open till 12 midnight
The Ambience is way better than any other McDonald's
It has oneplus one sitting area that is base and one level up so you will never fall short of sitting area are you don't have to wait if the place looks crowded
The services is quick and I would highly recommend this place"
5,"McDonald's is a renowned chain of fast food, specially famous for its burgers and fries.

They maintain good standard of quality and quantity food & beverages served across their chain of fast food restaurant.

In Mumbai among McDonald's restaurant chain this outlet is situated on LBS (Lal Bahadur Shashtri) road in Bhandup west on very prominent location inside Eastern Business District or commonly and widely known as Neptune Magnet Mall.

Among Mumbai City outlets this outlet is good for it's prompt service (specially in busy hours) and friendly staff.

The staff is very friendly and cooperative, best part is they assist people to order as per their requirement and budget.

One can choose from different options available time to time like value meal or set of combo's or can go for their regular menu.

They have good options available in beverages, specially in their Mccafe section.

The ambience of the outlet is very soothing, seating arrangement is spacious and in contemporary style can accommodate around fifty floating customers.

It is busy during lunch hours in weekdays and on weekends it is busy from opening to closing hours, (but floating crowd) best part is that the service is not hampered."
1,"Visited at Rmall Mulund, open Lobby AC cooling problem, counter service not good."
5,Fresh chicken available at best price
3,Thik thaak hi hai... Nothing special
5,Serves fresh quality chicken
5,It's service is very fast.
5,Best place to purchase chicken
1,This resturant was really good at the initial but now the service are not at all up to the mark. The owner is quite rude even the person that takes order is irresponsible of the customer and they don't behave good.its really a very bad experience as the behaviour of the staff needs to be good and cooperative but I am disappointed
4,"It was after a gap of almost 20 yrs that o went to this hotel and it has changed so much over these years.
It is pure veg with lots of options. The waiters gave good service even during peak business hours.
Coming to the food it's tasty but the quantity could have been more. I had Chinese which was much better in taste. they have air conditioning facility in their mezanine floor which is a huge setup.
Overall a decent place for veg food."
1,"food is good but the waiters are too much arrogent, don't have any talking manner with elders. maar khane layak kaam krte hai waiters. when I was asking waiters about availability of food items they both shouted and talk arrogantly with me and also shouted on my familys elder member. at the same time I have to hit him but I kept silence coz my family member, coz at that time I have to look my family member coz they are patients. worst waiters...... only star for food not for other things."
1,I visited recently with my friends at there AC section and Ordered food. We had to wait around half an hour to get one dish and another half hour to get another dish. After food arrived we asked for schezwan sauce as they didn‚Äôt serve with chinese food we ordered. They refused to serve and charged extra for that. The manager was arrogant. The experience is getting worse there.
1,"Found a Fly in my Dal, do check thoroughly before eating. Especially if you're Vegetarian and going in a Pure Veg Cafe."
1,Chicken was stale smelling and after showing this to the staff their response was not so good unsatisfied service
4,Food was Good ! Restaurant is clean and hygienic but this is not a place to go with more no. of people as it has smaller and fewer no. of tables and those tables couldn't be joined for a larger group. Prices feel slightly expensive for this place but overall it's satisfactory
1,"rice is already made,
they just heat it and gave it to you..
waiters are unprofessional, very arrogant as well..
never visit"
5,"One of the best Chinese I have had in recent times!!!!
Loved their chicken chilli and Chicken Chowmin (best I had). Also the staff is friendly and the dish tastes amazing."
1,Food quality is not good. Tasteless not chinese food
1,Gave an order on swiggy as there was rating of more than 4 but regreted the moment eat the first bite  cold food very less pieces of chicken and taste less
1,"The food there was absolutely terrible. While eating, it felt like dirt was entering my mouth. The food wasn't even fresh - it was like hell, so bad.

I would not recommend this place to anyone. The quality of food and service was extremely poor. They need to seriously improve their standards to attract customers. One star is even too much for this place. Extremely disappointed!"
5,Very nice test and fresh food . Good service
1,"We went to eat lunch after reading some positive reviews on this site. We ordered the lunch specials Schezwan rice & Chicken tandoori they both come in worst plates The atmosphere was very dumpy When our food came we were shocked at how bad it looked. The flavorless Chinese this was by far the worst Chinese food I have ever eaten in my life. Save your time and money and eat somewhere else, you have been warned!!"
5,"If anyone is making any bad comment that is thier point of view but as far as my experience, so many times i placed order i got all things in very good quality never ever compromise with the taste and also in our pocket budget everyone can affort it and i am preety sure everyone will loved it ."
5,"I ordered Cheese Blast Veg Feast Pizza, Exotic Garlic Bread, Chocolate Brownie & Choco Lava Cake. Well trust me as the name says 2X Toppings, it is totally true. It was heavily loaded with toppings. In every slice I could enjoy all the toppings. Cheese blast was super awesome. It was actually a cheese blast in my mouth when I had the first bite. Exotic Garlic Bread was fresh and I liked it.  My dessert Choco Lava was the best. Cheers to the wonderful team of Mojo Pizza."
4,"Ordered from mojo pizza yesterday evening and the parcel got delivered on time.

The Pizzas and the garlic breads were warm and it's aroma when I opened the package got me crazy. üòç

Fire me up- The pizza was fully loaded with cheeseüßÄ It had jalapenos , sweet corn and very tender chicken made in BBQ sauce. It was a bit on the spicier side. must try.

Garlic Breadsticks plus cheesy dip- The garlic breadsticks tasted heavenly and even better with the cheesy dip. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

Chicken Full Smash- This pizza had the most toppings I've ever seen on a pizza. It was fully loaded with chicken tikka, roasted chicken, and kebabs. It had veggies like red paprika, black olives, capsicum. Also lots and lots of cheese. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
1,We ordered 2 veg pizza yesterday in our office. Had terrible experience. Found non veg piece within our veg pizza. Seriously how these ppl are playing with vegetarian? they cheating n fooling ppl n selling non veg mix pizza.
4,"Ordered from mojo pizza for the first time. I was a bit nervous.I always ordered from Domino's but mojo pizza made me change my mind. Comparing to Domino's mojo pizza is a bit cheaper. Also, cheese burst of Domino's is around 70-80 whereas of mojo pizza it's of 40 rs and also a better cheese burst than Domino's (Domino's cheese burst crust is a myth/scam). Also the dough was fresh and soft, unlike Domino's, which gives dry crust. Coming to the 2x toppings, it's not 2x more than Domino's but a little bit more and I really had fun to eat it. I was full in just 1 7 inch pizza. Whereas you'll need two 7 inch Domino's pizzas to full. AND YES IM GOING TO CONTINUE TO ORDER FROM MOJO PIZZAS FROM NOW ON. If it says it serves 1, it actually does and fills your stomach and craving too unlike Domino's."
4,"i tried this pizza for the first time, and TBH it taste the best .
i ordered crowded house pizza which was loaded with extra cheese, paneer cubes, black olives, red paparika, golden corn, capsicum, onion which makes it taste soooo delicious"
3,They open late in the afternoon and the stuff is just okay to eat. Doesn't have much place to sit.
4,Weekend lunch is best offer
5,Good one
5,Delicious food overhere
3,Nice chinese food
4,Small south indian food outlet. Malayali special foods. Little bit congested
5,"The spicy Kerala food is available in its prime taste at very affordable rate. Delivery via zomato is not suggested. Better to dine in. Although it's a local store with few facilities, the taste of food is really awesome. Any Kerala food lover would love to visit there repeatedly. Such a wonderful experience. I was eating proper Kerala food after about 2 months. Very satisfactory in taste, quality and rate"
1,Very bad atmosphere... food worst..saw 2 hairs in rice when I order rice thali ..please do not visit...no neatness and cleanliness..
3,I love his Biriyani. Taste is average and the cost is reasonable.
5,"Good option for Kerala food. Walkable distance from IIT Bombay, Hiranandani Hospital and IT park. Good food at affordable rate."
1,"If delivering wrong products is an art, BOX8/Eat Club is the Picasso of it. This outlet is know for its carelessness and horrible service. They don't even acknowledge the mistake done if reported to the customer service. Today, they had a put up a rusted stapler pin inside the roll which I had ordered. Bhale hi aadmi hospital chala jaye inko kuch fark nahi padta"
5,"There are few outlets for food which serve food that makes you feel like home. Box8 located at Powai definitely serves to please which is evident in its quality & quantity. The professional approach will definitely take it long way. I ordered for Pepper garlic chicken wings, chicken tikka churchur, very peri chicken wings, Teekha meetha chicken wings. All in all good value for time, money and energy. I definitely vouch for this place."
5,"I loved Amritsari Chola and Paratha Thali, Loved that you had that option available. Partha was So so good well made. Felt like home. Loved the taste."
1,"When I order meal with them they always send wrong meal has happened 3rd time today and nobody to contact and write to , had ordered rice came with parathas 3rd time same mistake and complaint to box8 they send 100 credit points and forget but not correct it
Shame on these people"
4,This review is from few of us who have ordered from Box8..this is is very tasty and delicious..they have chicken salad also which is very healthy and I loved it ..
4,"Very good samosas and have been serving for a generation. Their samosa has a unique taste and I always prefer it for any house function.
The shop is situated right next to JVLR road. Ice creams are also provided but only of Vadilal brand and it also provided juices and soft drinks.
You won't get any benches to sit and will have to stand and eat. Takeways are available and the staff is cooperative. Home delivery is available for bulk order. For eg more than 15 or more samosas."
5,"I love the samosas over here and the samosa chat, the take care of the hygiene wear a mask and hairnet. The main thing is everytime you visit the Samosas are Hot and Fresh üëåüèª"
4,Ice cream & Kulfi family packs available here
5,"Best samosas I have ever had in Mumbai... Best part is you can also take it to other country... Believe me it's true with zero compromise to the taste.

If you love samosa, go visit this place or search on Swiggy n Zomato..."
4,"The best place to have samosa, vada pav and Jalebi. They have served us hot and it was heavenly. Also you can have ice cream which is just as any other parlors icecream. Overall a good experience and cleanliness was on point."
5,"We wanted to Jain thali. Thought it was not on their menu, they specially cooked entire jain meal for us.. it was super tasty and the quantity was more than required. It felt like a home cooked meal. The delivery was quick. Must try place."
5,"The classic salli is fresh and light, perfect for evening snacks!"
4,"Really good! Here's something else you could say instead of delicious.....
Yummy, Flavorful & Mouth-watering..."
5,"Best service...
Affordable price and a better service than Bikaner.All the Frankie's rates  are affordable plus more tasty.All the items including PavBhaji, Chole Bhature ,Dosa,Idli
Mendu Vadu they serve more than 55 to 60 dishes. There main attractions is Panipuri flavored shots .The packaging for delivery is also great .Mainly it is better place than bikaner.........."
1,"It takes lots of time to serve a dish we order, Poor service. The girl in countrpart was so rude dont even have manners how to talk to customers the food was not price worthy.The worst sandwitch i ever had"
1,"Worst quality! Worst worst worst

I dint know Monginis has actually degraded it's quality so much.. had no option hence had entered this shop but all pastries taken were hard and stale..cream colour of black forest was brown instead of white. Extremely hard cakes, not 1% soft..I felt like puking after the first piece.
Beware and never spoil your health by eating from Monginis. Shame on the cheaters playing with Customer's health
Mood spoiled health spoiled! Utter waste of money!"
1,I had devil delight pastry which was 3 days old stock and very hard to eat
1,"Had packed 2 red velvet pastries a week back...it tasted like plastic with some strange chemical odour..trashed it ofcourse. Also, they don't give a bill until you ask. Never going back there"
1,"I ordered 1 kg pineapple cake with print but they gave some other flavour cake which was dry, chocolate cream on top , yellow coloured unflavor choclate flake on side , make looked like it's pineapple cake...........
Plz don't waste money buying from Monginis"
1,"A cake made 2 days before was given which we order a day before for the birthday.
the same poor and unfresh cake they putted in front of me as new one, totally disappointed and very veryyy bad service and cakes in this Monginis Cake shop.ü§Æü§Æü§¢ü§¢
see now what is happening with this cakesü§Æü§¢,
Veryyyy bad quality"
5,"Domino's taste differs from place to place. Till now, this is the best outlet in terms of product quality. The ambiance is okay, not so good. The washrooms are unhygienic."
1,"Worst experience ever with Bhandup Domino's.
Placed an order over 1.5 hours ago ‚Äî it finally arrived ice cold. Tried contacting them, but none of the provided numbers are working. No updates, no response, no professionalism. Clearly taking advantage of customers just because there's no other Domino's nearby. Pathetic service, zero accountability.
Avoid ordering from here at all costs. Total disappointment."
1,"Ok so this is not the first time I have faced this issue. I seriously don't know what the problem is with this outlet of Dominos. They just cook for the sake of cooking without maintaining proper texture of the pizza, without adding all the toppings and without proper cutting.
Worst when it comes to home deliveries. This outlet needs severe attention from Dominos management and the cooks and the staff need to learn how to work in a proper way"
5,"Although this pizza outlet ambience is not so good yet my first experience at this Domino's outlet has been good. The person on the counter was quick and gave me proper information about the delivery wait period. Moreover, this girl cleaned up all the tables herself where the irresponsible public left their used boxes instead of putting it in the Dustin. She arranged the dustbin and cleared up the tables and also wiped them clean although there were other staffs going up and down. Bravo to Ms.Pranali."
1,"Such worst service! We ordered pizza yesterday with order number 239 from Bhandup West branch of dominos. Firstly the pizza came late and the person from the branch told us when the delivery boy will come, ask him toh tag the late delivery. On the other hand l, delivery boy said restaurant has asked him not to tag late delivery that will happen on the branch. What pathetic gimmic to save late delivery tag at their branch!! We have been trying to contact the branch and someone nationally. Nationally toh you just can't reach these people thanks to ivrs!!! The local branch people are worst. Firstly they told us that we will give you our personal number, when you order next, put COD and they will pay for the order. We refused since in our order the garlic bread had no garlic + they used tomato ketchup in the pizza! So we don't want to order next from dominos and from the bhandup west branch. Then suraj maurya from the branch told me he will refund me in my personal bank account within 10 mins, when we asked to do this while call is on he was making excuses that ""trust rakhiye"". When we insisted to do the refund while the call is on, after few minutes he said ""aapka order kal ka tha toh kal EOD takk hi refund ho skta tha"". PATHETIC!!!!!! If Dominos has this policy to refund by that day, why it not happened that day dominoz!!!!! Such pathetic cunning people just trying to save the dying brand. I will go to the consumer court."
1,"I am requesting all the customers who planing to buy food from the famous Madras Cafe (Bhandup branch) and reading this review, PLEASE DO NOT PLACE ORDER from madras cafe, Bhandup branch. They are delivering hot food in non hygienic polythene bags. We all know how unhealthy and dangerous (carcinogenic) to having food which delivered in polythene bags. This happened with me second time. This is really not acceptable, they are literally playing with customer's health."
5,"Madaras Cafe serves some amazing South Indian food! üòä Recently, I tried their Bhav Bhaji, and let me tell you, it's like nothing I've ever tasted before ‚Äì especially the pav bhaji, it's absolutely awesome! üå∂Ô∏èüçõ To all the pav bhaji lovers out there, this is a must-try. Just go for it without any doubts"
4,We saw reviews that they serve the best Pav Bhaji and it's true. Their pav bhaji was good and the quality and quantity both were good too. Would recommend.
5,"Had this punjabi thali yesterday. It was worth it. Never thought it will be this good. Worth every penny. 4 types of bhaji along with raita, papad, dahi wada, gulab jamun, dal fry, roti and jeera rice. At the end, we ordered salted lassi, it was okiesh. I would suggest avoid it."
4,Good quality food. Reasonable rates. Good service
1,"We have bought death by chocolate cake it was horrible in taste and texure it was not fresh, very stale ....it's high time Monginis require to increase standard and keep check on franchise to deliver fresh cakes. Worst experience"
1,"Once I went to this cake shop but my experience was very unpleasant. Lady staff was very rude. Though I was talking to her nicely, she was throwing tantrums and her tone was very very bad. I didn't purchase anything from her.
Monginis is a good brand but their unprofessional behaviour is going to cost them.
If you have self respect do not visit here."
1,"The staff is really really rude bad experience. Tastes stale.The staff needs to learn how to talk.She has been rude every time. I, as a custome.  suggest fire her.The lady who's the owner is also not friendly as well. I buy pastry from here all the time. I just asked for a small candle they wouldn't give it. The last time I had gone there the staff made faces to me and spoke Ina very bad tone. Worst people. There are many better places that know how to behave and are far better in terms of taste .Kindly go there."
1,"I am writing to express my disappointment with my recent visit. I encountered unprofessional behavior from the lady staff, which significantly impacted my experience. The staff member in question was consistently rude, making faces and speaking in an unpleasant tone during my visit.

Additionally, the cake I purchased was noticeably old and did not meet the quality I expected.

There are many other Cake shops that offer better service and quality. I hope you address these issues to improve the experience for future customers."
1,"I parcelled a pastry worth Rs80. On reaching home, i immediately took it on a plate to eat. But it was so dry, the cream was dry too. The cream came out & fell onto the table, when i picked it up, it was hard & the table was still clean, as it no cream fell, but some solid particle. Their quality has degraded to a very high extent. I will never purchase any monginis stuff henceforth."
4,Decent place not too good not too bad
3,It's just Ok. Like any other Bar.
5,I visit here offently. They have recently renovated the Bar which looks more attractive and pleasant. Food is good and good service. You can take parcel till 1am night and food close at 12.30am night
5,Better Service and Rates.. Waiters normally don't provide service for tables they aren't handling.. But here they do it done as i think it's instructed by Managers / Supervisors there.. So i would say better management what u will find here..
4,Great food.. Great service.. Affordable drinks.. Not much expensive even in a/c.. They even have a private room where you can stay away from other crowd when you're having a group party

Breakfast options are decent too. Very reasonably priced. A lot better than nearby more expensive places (where we also ate but primarily just for air conditioning).

Reliable choice. Attentive service."

The food, atmosphere, service are still upto date and they have still not compromised on the food even after these many years, it's a small decent place with proper hygiene. one of my most fav place to go for an amazing breakfast.

3,"Tried one pastry and chocolate ball. Taste of both the items was okay. Pastry had sugar sort of, and chocolate ball had caramel so not that both were made of complete chocolate. But still better than Ayenger Bakery. The person on the counter was okayish. Price was reasonable, pastry was of 45 and ball 40."
2,"Yesterday 30/01/2025 had the unfortunate experience of trying a doughnut from Monginis Vikhroli West (near railway station)that I can only describe as ""Bad Doughnut,"" and it was truly disappointing.Informed same to the shop owner, he suggested,make it heat and try. I said i did the same but it's taste like minimum 2 to 3 or more old and bun is so hard and crunchy.

I ordered 3pcs of Doughnut, Full pastry cake and chips. Other than doughnut all items was good.The doughnut I ordered looked decent at first glance, but the first bite revealed its true nature. The texture was all wrong‚Äîit was dry and crumbly, as if it had been sitting out for days.It tasted stale and lacked any of the freshness or richness you'd expect from a good doughnut.

""Bad Doughnut"" lives up to its name in the worst way possible. From the stale, dry doughnuts to the poor service and there‚Äôs very little to recommend here. If you‚Äôre craving a good doughnut, I‚Äôd strongly suggest looking elsewhere. This place is not worth your time or money."
3,"Location - It is located just near the Vikhroli station

3,"The taste was good for the Choclate Dutch cake!
Not much variety with availability of the cakes!
Located near to the Vikhroli-west station.
Would suggest to bring in more varieties."
1,"Ordered Veg puff, it was limp and leathery. No taste, no vegetables and found something weird in the filling. The manager was uncooperatice and unwilling to take the feedback.
Never expected this from MONGINIS Vikhroli west .
Road side stuff is now better than their product.
A unhappy customer.
Next time wont buy."

1,"Order delay alert! üö® It's been over 1 hour since I placed my order, but I still haven't received it. The app promised 30-minute delivery, yet there's no support. Feels like employees only care about giving 5-star reviews for the app, not about delivering on time! üò°"""
1,"Chose to dine in for my friend's birthday, we were already sitting at the table after ordering , just got up to take an important call and when I came back some lady had taken my seat when she had known I was already sitting there she didn't bother my friend telling her it was occupied and when I confronted her she denied having taken the chair. When informed the staff to look in, the staff instead asked me to pull out a heavy chair from another corner of the place. Terrible customer service if you can't manage a dine in why even operate one. Is it the customer's responsibility to drag out chairs from here and there just because someone else steals the occupied ones."
1,Not putting cheese properly every time we are facing this everytime

BOX8 serves the very crazy mashups of Indian dishes.
Specially the theeka meetha chicken wings, what a beautiful taste it had just üíØüíØ loved it.
Also Ordered their mushroom masala Curry taste was pretty decent.
They have also got enough for your desserts,
In which I liked their deeply Fried gulab jamuns tasty and gets you a richer taste.
And then comes their professionally baked chocolava cake. You guys must also try it if you haven't already. It's must‚ô•Ô∏è"
1,"The worst ever experience in terms of delivery responsibility. No one picks up. Customer care takes centuries to pick up calls at night. If there is no late night delivery available, then don't accept right . So much hassle is caused when constantly one is trying to contact this Vikhroli counter of Box8 and they don't answer. And have zero responsibility with orders. And added to that , they take responsibility to deliver themselves. People. This is a Warning ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è Do not order from Box8 Vikhroli. Pathetic service. Zero Responsibility. Order ID of Zomato : 240191 placed and they are not responding and not doing anything . Totally unresponsive . Totally irresponsible"
5,"The app is very easy to navigate. About the food: There is something for everyone. Lots of options and a range of variety. I ordered a veg sandwich and chicken seekh kabab sandwich, loved the flavour. And I was surprised with a yummy brownie. Bonus points to box 8 for that!"
1,I have 2 ordered butter chicken but it was very worst very tasteless food they are providing and in butter chicken all the pieces are burnt after than we spoke to restaurant then they said we will provide you alternative but they are asking for the used gravy but we have served to our guest so we can't take that back so how it will be possible but the restaurant gave only 1 gravy because of that. Please take my advice don't do any transaction with the restaurant
2,"After long time I visited restuarant . It is near to R city Mall.
In starter we ordered Rashmi Kabab. The taste of kabab was very ok . Not cooked properly.
In main we ordered murg muslam , and Singapore Rice .
The quantity of murg muslam was good . Taste also ok.
Singapore Rice was not tasty.
Seating arrangements was also very conjusted
Even 4 people also cannot able to seat properly. Very small tables.
Service was not good.
The overall experience was very average."
1,"Today I went to eat in a decent restaurant, ordered murg musallam, the food was very tasteless, and from there I bought chicken noodles parcel which was of very cheap quality, after paying 190 it felt like it was 30. Have eaten rupees plate roadside noodles, that too is better in taste, because all vegetable's have been cooked in noodles and,
It seemed as if I was eating boiled noodles.
Hotel infrastructure does not matter, taste and service do matter, please work on it.ü§å"
1,I ordered chiken crispy half pices fresh but half pices use I think yestardays so not like chiken crispy and don't order online
2,"Quantity is too less, i have attached the image of their Starter Chicken Maharaja Dry of 240/- and Chicken Darbari Dry of 230/- just to get 7-8 small pieces of Chicken ... Huh ... Dont order it."
5,"Mantra's in Powai has maintained and even bettered their standing in all aspects be it food, service or ambience since the last 10years.  It was our 2nd time booking their Banquet Hall for a small event and everything  was a breeze, right from booking , menu selection,
special requests etc.
Will highly recommend  Mantra's.  You must try their food and service once atleast and experience it yourself"
4,"My family and I recently visited Into Mantra. We ordered a mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. The non-veg items were absolutely delicious‚ÄîI really enjoyed them! However, my family mentioned that the veg dishes were a bit too salty. Overall, it was a nice experience, and a small tweak on the seasoning would make it even better."
5,"A Great Spot to Unwind
I've been to Mantra Dining Bar at Powai Plaza many times, and I must say it's a great spot to unwind with friends or colleagues. The ambiance is lively and modern, with a great selection of drinks and food.

Pros:
- Mantra has an impressive selection of cocktails, beers, and wines, making it a great spot for those who enjoy a good drink.
- The food at Mantra is delicious and varied, with a range of options to suit different tastes and dietary preferences.
- The ambiance at Mantra is lively and modern, making it a great spot to relax and socialize.
- The staff at Mantra are friendly and attentive, always happy to help with any requests or questions.

Things to Improve:
- Some might find the music a bit too loud, so it might be worth considering adjusting the volume to create a more comfortable atmosphere.

Overall Experience:
I highly recommend Mantra Dining Bar to anyone looking for a great spot to unwind and enjoy good food and drinks. With its lively ambiance, great selection of drinks, and delicious food, it's a great destination for anyone in Powai."
5,Nice place for veg and nonveg food. A great place for meeting friends and family
4,It has good food options with bar and fine dining in separate area next to each other.  Food Quality and service is good. Rates are quite economic. There is valet parking available.
4,"Go Local at,
Local Adda a small  outlet located behind Powai Plaza bringing to you quality food with their quickest service.An open air outlet where you get to enjoy the finest vegetarian delicacies.

A perfect way to start and beat this summer heat is a cold beverage and so we started off with the same..
‚Ä¢Virgin Mojito:
Being very particular about Mojito, this was beyond my expectation and really good that I couldn't stop myself from ordering one more. Lets just say you wanna try a Mojito it should be At Local Adda.

‚Ä¢Cold coffee:
A cold coffee but a strong one with quite good amount of coffee for people who prefer so.

‚Ä¢Open Chilly Toast:
Hot and crispy chilly toast a good starter to start with.

‚Ä¢PavBhaji Cheese Hotdog:
A hotdog in desi style with buttery Bhaji and onions on top making it utterly buttery delicious! üòã Highly Recommended.

‚Ä¢Manchurian cheese Roll:
When it comes to Rolls , to me the quality is of a primary concern .This has got both quality as well as quantity.

‚Ä¢Cheese fries and Manchurian fries:
HOLY CHEESE! OMG
PLEASE GIVE ME SOME MORE. Yup I'm pretty sure y'all will be screaming the same once you try this one out.

‚Ä¢the manchurian Fries:
Pretty good but not something to brag about because I personally felt that the manchurian should be served separately instead of mixing it entirely with the fries.An Average dish overall.

‚Ä¢Mexican delight and Paneer Tikka cheese Pizza:
Pizzas? They can never go wrong no matter what it has! Both the pizzas were quantity wise good and quality wise excellent. I would say, the Paneer Tikka was winning the race there!

‚Ä¢Chocolate pizza:
Beautifully presented with colourful gems giving a catch to both , the eyes and taste.

Lastly, one reason I would keep dropping by at this place and would definitely never get bored off is their Khullad Chai. Trust me when I say, it is Mind BLOWING üëå

‚Ä¢The khullad Chai :
Chai made from their home made masala served in khullad . A great taste and the best thing about this chai is the price . Quite affordable  in the entire Mumbai I could say.

Amazing staff with lovely satisfactory service.
Must visit!"
4,"Local Adda, I think is a Vegetarians paradise.

Me being a Non Vegetarian, it's very difficult to impress me with Veg food. Having said that Local a·∏ç·∏ça had good variations and a good spread of food options in their menu.

A small fast food joint in Powai, behind Powai Plaza and having open air seatings, this place is poised for office goers, the college goers and for people who want to grad a quick snack. We a group of 6 had the below:

Masala Chai and Biscuit: Ecen thought it's for 25 rupees, this masala chai is totally worth it.

Cold coffee: The coffee is standard and not dissapointing.

Virgin Mojito: one of the best Mojito's I have had in a while. Highly recommended.

Cheesy Fries: This was something to die for. Must try.

Sczhewan fries: This wasn't that great was average. Would like the Sczhewan served seperately.

Manchurian Cheese Roll: highly recommended. Good quantity and quality. Great taste.

Mexican Delight and Paneer Tikka cheese Pizza: both the pizzas were delicious and cost wise it's reasonably priced at 240 rupees.

Chilli Garlic Noodles: the garlic and chilly was overpowering, and I like my dish that way so I wasn't dissapointed. Some of my friends were. Please tell the staff to level down the spice to suit your palatte.

Cheesy Pasta: The salt was a bit less which the staff corrected for our on our request. Overall taste could have been better but you can say it was an average dish.

Pav Bhaji Cheese Hotdog: I can see what the chef was trying here. The pav bhaji had to be spot on, it wasn't. Average dish.

Open Chilly Toast: Great snacker. This went well with the Mojito.

Chocolate Pizza: LOVED IT !! But I did think for 240 rupees it is relatively expensive.

Overall I only found the Cheesy Pasta, Pav Bhaji Cheese Hotdog  to be really average.

Rest, we had a wonderful time with a wonderful staff.

Overall we rate this place a 4 star."
5,"If you're looking for a quick yet comfy bite, Local Adda is the perfect place for it. Tried a variety of items during my visit and was mighty happy with the output. I love how they have a cheese version of almost everything, who doesn't love cheese! My favorite would be the mushroom alfredo open toast, you cannot miss that. Wash it down with their refreshing mojito and you're sure to go back with a smile on your face. And the prices are super pocket-friendly too, total value for money."
4,"Recently visited this place in powai, located outside Hakone Entertainment Centre,Powai. This place serves a variety of beverages. They have some of the best coolers and mojitos. We tried their black current cooler,it was very refreshing. The coolers here are definitely a must try if you are visiting Hakone!"
1,"Worst tandoori momos in india. If you are visiting this place do not try momos at local adda. Else go inside and have it from the royal tandoori momos. We were 6 friends luckily we order only 2 plates and wasted 300rs. Don't know on what scale it was tandoori momos it was literally fried momos which was just kept on tandoor. Most of them were broken. If any head chief is looking at this review please go through the tandoori momos recipe before selling anything.

Reply:- How can someone go so low and create fake cenario just to save the name of the joint. Let me tell you something.

1. We were there at around 10.30 and not 10.15.

2. We order 2 plates of tandoori momos ( which was very bad ). Me and my friend didn't say anything about the cancellation. We didn't even went near the counter for any review or anything check cctv.

3. The person on the counter was very rude we order just after ordering without billing he was like pahile paisa do...

Accept your mistake sir and don't go so low just to save the joint name.
Thank you."
5,"As always the best place to fulfill your hunger. Satisfying taste and affordable price is what Domino's i love for.
Always looking forward to find Domino's restaurants near me whenever i am in new location because it the place everyone loves to go and get most delicious pizzas of Domino's."
4,I told them to add cheese burst to it probably jalepano cheese sticks are added to the side of the pizza. That's too yummy. You'll find such kind of pizza's at Pizza Hut if you are a cheese love. Instead they added more cheese to pizza which took away the taste of that pizza. I ordered medium size African Peri-Peri (Veg & Non Veg) mix. You save a lot of money if you combine  it in one üçï.
1,"Worst service ever
Ordered 7 pizza's and its more than one hour and no one from the store is responding and also there is no customer Support team from amazon"
1,I ordered from Zomato. They dint deliver for 2 hours and after that they showed deliver without delivering the food. Fraudster they are. Never ever visit them.
1,"Thes guys are big time scammers. They show open to order on Swiggy and Zomato during the night even though the restaurant is about to close. Horrible experience multiple times with this branch, they fleece you of your money and the order never even gets delivered. Pathetic service, don‚Äôt ever trust these thieves."
5,I had ordered for two pizzas and one garlic bread with cheesy dip. The pizzas were really soft and perfectly made. The pizzas were loaded with toppings. The edges of the pizza were really soft. The pizza was also delivered on time. No delay at all. Overall it was worth every penny.
5,"In Mumbai there are so many new opened pizza outlet, it such a confusion to choose the best from all. And for me when I need to order pizza mojo pizza comes in my mind.
It‚Äôs a delivery outlet, the pizza served over here is not less then any other famous pizza outlet.
They have different base of pizza right from thin crust to cheese base and you can choose from a huge varieties.
I ordered
Chicken full smash-
The pizza was overloaded by chicken tikka, chicken kebab, roast chicken, capsicum, black olives, onion, red paprika

Fire me up-
Pizza was loaded by BBQ chicken, chicken tikka, baby corn, spicy jalape√±o.

Chocolate lava cake.

This outlet serves really good pizza.
Very much recommended."
4,This is their Peri Peri Paneer pizza. It tastes heavenly!! ‚ú® Toppings are perfect and the taste is awesome. Loving Mojo more than any other pizza brand. Must try this one as it's one of their bestsellers.
5,Mojo Pizza serves the Best Pizzas in Vijay Nagar.The Size and quality of there pizza is just amazing.I Had ordered Meat eater and Smokey Joey From here.Both the Pizzas were just amazing the toppings were excellant the base was smooth.The chicken was os soft and tender hope to get back to u soon Thank u so Much Mojo Pizza

4,"""The food was excellent‚Äîwe had vegetable spring rolls and Hakka noodles. The ambiance was enjoyable, and the service was great. The only area for improvement is the Schezwan chutney, which tasted more like tomato sauce than authentic Schezwan."""
1,"Food is pathetic and very bad . They will serve something else in the name of Chinese. If you are in good mood to have Chinese then please don‚Äôt try here and spoil. Stale paneer and bad taste quality of food.

Chinese will die after seeing this, we can kill the Chinese soldier and win the war by showing or tasting them this chopstick restaurant Chinese food. We don‚Äôt need Any arms and ammunition against Chinese soldier for winning Siachen.
Chopstick Chinese food will them automatically.

On serious note ! This food is very bad and they will disappoint you for sure."
1,I been to this place yesterday.. service from staff was good however the food was not so pleasant i had ordered chi lollipop shezwan masala they were not fresh or were fully frozen and some of them smelt like rotten mean near bone part..  chi hakka noodles were tasteless and the main this the food had too much of MSG (ajinomoto) as soon as i left the restaurant I had a spike in my BP and now today is 7 July 2024 suffering from fever‚Ä¶
4,I always wanted to visit this place and I finally did. This place is 300 metres from Vikroli station west. Cozy little place for friends and families to meet. Their service is quick. Their food is great too. We had Veg spring roll and veg mushroom fried rice. Best part is that the food price doesn't pinch your pockets.
4,This place serves authentic Malvani style food. The food quality and authenticity is very evident. The food is reasonably priced. It is not a fine dining restaurant but a shop in a food courts of Galleria. The atmosphere can be improved. The service was okaish could be a bit bit faster. We tried Bombay duck fish fry. Mutton liver curry with Yada. The food is really spicy typical of Konkan area.
1,Ordered Bangda thali but the fish was stinking and place where they cook looked unhygienic. ..bad experience
1,"Please do not order from this restaurant. They do not maintain any hygiene. They sent cockroach in chicken sukkha thali. After calling them, they said had done pest control the previous night. Which means they have given us food with pesticides. You will get yourself poisoned if you order from this restaurant.
Pathetic food, unhygienic, no quality!!"
4,"Our first choice was Surmai thali. But unfortunately, it wasn't available then. So, we settled for Pomfret thali (‚Çπ450). My vegetarian friend ordered Mini Veg thali (‚Çπ99). It took little longer than I expected to serve our thalis. Fried Pomfret fish was fresh, and moderately sized (palm sized). Well marinated, and fried to the right extent. Curries were nice (one prawns, another one plain). Not overly spicy, not watery. Chapatis were hot, soft, and freshly prepared. Solkadhi was good. We ordered extra Solkadhi glasses (‚Çπ60/glass) as a kind of non-alcoholic digestif to end our meals.

The staff was courteous. We sat at a food court. Therefore, the place was somewhat crowded, and noisy. It was well lit, open, and ventilated. But there were flies too.

The food, and experience was good. It was my nephew's first meal in India after many years. I am glad that he enjoyed, and liked it. I will visit it again to try their Surmai thali."
4,"""I ordered Chicken vade for dinner, food was delicious, I love it, too good chicken curry. Must try. Chicken pieces should have been better, it was bones with less meat."""
4,"Awesome cakes ,brownies and pastries. You can have puffs and burgers also."
4,"The employee name Yogesh was so honest, he refrained me from paying extra bymistake. Very kind gesture irrespective of the amount to be very small."
5,Awesome service.  Very polite staff.  Lip smacking cakes. Must visit the shop and try their wide variety of cakes.
5,Most Deliciousüòã and Very Good Quality Cake üç∞ I ever had. I am loving for it's Freshness and good service
3,Is quite pocket friendly but don't have a lot many varieties available. Have gone a bit down in terms of quality too.
5,"Chami's is brilliant. As a working professional for 2 years - this has taken care of all the food problems that my parents were scared of when I was moving to Bombay.

Offering tasty, healthy a-la-carte food for the first 1 year and starting up Tiffin service for the subsequent one, Chami's has made Bombay food cheap and easy on my stomach. Not once has the food disrupted my system. The owner is super helpful and friendly, and open to special preparations and generous with add-ons and requests.

The only hiccup is delivery time on certain super busy days, but overall this still gets my 5-stars because I have literally survived on Chami's food for the last 2 years. If you're living nearby and don't have a cook - call them up and register for their Tiffin right now. You won't regret it."
5,"üç± BOX 8 - DESI MEALüç±

when you are so hungry and u got box8 meal trust me it's a wonderful feeling ever.

Starting with paneer steak:-Perfectly cooked and fresh.

All in one meal :- was inough for one person. Including 2 different gravies and paratha with salad and brownie along with it.

Paneer veg biryani :- it was so good. And that golden fried onions were giving an extra taste to it.

Chicken Kathi wrap:- the taste nice but the outer layer was of grains which little bit i didn't liked.

2,"Food saviours to the rescue. BOX8 served up a great cooking also being on time.

Ordered:

Not impressed yet with the salad. It was a bit dry and taste was blant. Hopefully Box8 will work on it."

Ordered the litti chhokha !! In love with it"
1,I ordered food from here. Absolutely horrendous. Found an insect in my food. This place should be shut down. Absolutely unacceptable.
5,"Good quality of food
Wide range of items to choose from
They serve one of the best daal baati in MumbaiüòÄ"

Great to know that it's purely veg and vrat thali, ugadi thali are available."
5,Pure veg good quality and taste also
4,"Place is full Punjabi style. Food options are limited but yet good. Taste is good but quantity is less. We were four, so had to order more as one quantity was not sufficient.
Ambience is great and you can feel the Punjabi taste in their decor and music.üé∂üéµ
Overall a must visit place."
3,"Turban Tales, this place surely does justice to its name and as soon as you step inside this restaurant it will remind you of the typical punjabi dhabas, the colorful theme of this restaurant defines how beautiful and vibrant the Punjabi cultural is.

I have to mention the level of detail they have used to make this place a memorable experience for their customers. To name a few they had stool chairs made out of Kadhai üòÇ next is they had placed a ‚ÄúBHOPU‚Äù (horn) on every single table if they wanna grab the attention of the waiter. They had converted a Tractor Bonnet into a table. You should experience it yourself I won't say anything more now.

‚óΩPaneer Papdi

Soft Cottage Cheese cubes coated with crushed Papdi and deep fried until crisp. It was a good idea, but it was accompanied with just ketchup. I wished it had some sauce poured over it to give it some flavor.

Rating - 6/10

‚óΩJalebi Chaat

Dahi Bhallas topped with Spicy Green Chutney and Sweet Imli Chutney and garnished with deep fried Jalebis which were not sweet as they were not soaked in the sugar syrup (makes sense). Again the concept of Jalebi in a chaat was amazing. I wish the Jalebi was incorporated in the chat itself they had just used it as a garnish to the dish.

‚óΩChatpate Honey Aloo

This is something that I loved here! Normal Finger Chips coated with honey and sauteed with Red Yellow and Green Bell Peppers and garnished with sesame seeds. ORDER IT!

‚óΩTikka momos

It was beautiful to look and also good to taste it was stuffed with cheese. I got a fishy smell from the second piece. N it made me avoid the same (Staff - You need to check if the oil being used to cook veg and non-veg food is different.)

These are one of the best quesadillas I have had till date. The sauce which they give along with it was superb.

‚óΩRajma Chaul

This was one of my favorite main course of the night, it was served in a weirdly shaped, yet good looking bowl and presented so well. The right half of the bowl was filled with Jeera Rice and it had a beautiful mild flavor of clarified butter, left half was filled with Rajma cooked to perfection and all this was topped with onions.

One of the finest Lassi I have ever tried in my life! I wish I had ordered it prior to the main course. Its just amazing!

5,"Earlier this week, we were at Turban Tales - the soon-to-be-opened Dhaba themed restaurant situated on Powai's bustling JVLR lane right opposite to IIT Powai.

Turban Tales is extraordinary when we talk about its ambiance - rotating center tables, nostalgic vintage chairs, tractor benches, rotating whirlwinds, matkas, overturned buckets, hanging bangles, huge wooden doors and an extravagant view of JVLR - We're sure this place holds the right spot.

Looking at what they had to offer us was a sheer evidence of their experimentation with food and flovours. Not just that - They gave utmost and equal respect to the Vegetarians as well - giving them a chance to taste Non Veg food, ofcourse in a Veg twist.

What we were served - Tokri Chaat, Veg Tikka Momos, Button Mushrooms stuffed with Cheese, Reshmi Soy Champ, Paneer Papdi, Veg Quesadilla, Mummy ki Dal with Roti, Chuski Rita, Love from South Hall, Amarsar to Thailand and Paan Icecream with Apple Murabba.

Tokri Chaat: Basket Chaat¬†also known as Tokri Chaat or Katori Chaat prepared with the crisp basket of grated potato & delicious filling of chole topped with tomato, onions, tamarind chutney, mint chutney, curd and nylon Sev. Marvellous creation but nothing other than ordinary. Golden old recipe done right!

Veg Tikka Momos: Naans filled with Momos fillings and shaped as Chicken Tandoori - This is sure every Vegetarians delight! Never would have thought of having Veg Tandoori/Tangdi with a Momo twish. Turban Style! Shout out!

Button Mushrooms stuffed with Cheese: Crunchy onions and gooey¬†cheese¬†make a wonderful filling for large and succulent button¬†mushrooms. What an idea Sirjee! Adding to my list of best mushroom starters.

Reshmi Soy Champ: Ever seen Chicken Reshmi Kebab and never had it because you're a Vegetarian - You've got the perfect excuse to visit TT. Reshmi Soy Champ is a thoughtful creation of Veg Reshmi Soy Kebabs so soft that you'll miss finishing it faster. Mock meat level undefined!

Paneer Papdi: Paneer Papdi¬†is a delicious masaledaar fusion of paneer¬†cubes marinated in curd based paste and then coated in roasted papad served with peanut dip. The taste of papad coating outsmarts the dampness of the dip. What a complementing starter-dip duo!

Veg Quesadilla: Usual Mexican Parantha (as we see it) stuffed with Desi veggies. Something usual to have on the list.

Mummy ki Dal with Roti: Delicious dal cooked in spices and generous amount of ghee, butter, cream and curd. Direct from Punjab, this Mummy ki dal¬†is simmered for 20+ hours to get that perfect smokey taste. This isn't overcooking - It is perfect cooking!

Chuski Rita: Flavoured Alcoholic Margarita with Ice Popsicles. Damn you don't consume alcohol? Never mind! TT is the only place where they give cocktail as mocktail too. So next time your friend order a cocktail, just double it up as a mocktail too ;)

Love from South Hall: Gin combined with honeydew rose, ginger juice and soda served in rose perfumed glass. This drink will surely tickle every taste bud 'cause it tastes just like Pulse Chocolate. ChatPataka!

Amarsar to Thailand: White rum mixed with Sugarcane juice, galanjal, kaafir and mint leaves balanced with lime

Paan Icecream with Apple Murabba: A digestive dessert with all the goodness of ice- cream flavoured with paan served on a betel leaf itself and Apple Murabba. A mouth freshener and dessert in itself. Mind blowing!

High on its ambiance and dedication to make hearty dishes, Turban Tales is easily the best and the most impressive food memory for The Good Food Pact!

Keep it up Team TT and Mini Punjab. Thank you Nishant for being such an informative host.

3,"A rooftop place right above Mini Punjab. This place serves drinks and decent food. Although this place is an costly affair, some of their dishes are delightful. Place charges you 10% service charge on the bill. Service is not of top quality."
1,"Ordered quesadillas, chole kulcha and lassi.. Except the lassi didn't enjoy any of their food.. In the name of Kulchas you will get coloured bread (very dry obviously) which tasted really bad, Quesadillas as you can see was oily.. Ambience is OK.. Service is OK. But food üëé"
5,"Visited this restaurant twice and shared my feedback on these two instances.

Chicken Tandoori - Well served, nice texture and served well.

Service - Overall it's nice and friendly, however the speed of serving can be improved.

It's a nice place for group gathering, corporate gathering and friends. Where you want to enjoy a nice chit chat and your drinks with nice food.
It is well located just few meters from Powai plaza.
One of my fav place post office hours gathering."
4,"It's Sagar, just like name this place is larger than any stand alone bar, upstairs rooftop option where you can smoke on table itself, downstairs family dinning kind of arrangements but more like bar, Good food, dal tadka jira rice is famous here, and so Dal khichdi, in Veg Paneer Angara is decent with kulcha, in non veg bangda fish you can try, Chana garlic Koli walda is also good option in chakna items, And chicken chili and chiken leg piece is good, price on menu and price on bill is difference please check and verify with Waiters always,Rates are reasonable and no service Charges"
5,"Sagar is such a vibe! The atmosphere is super chill and perfect for hanging out with friends. The food is amazing ‚Äî full of flavor and Instagram-worthy too.

Prices are reasonable, and the service is quick and friendly. The rooftop seating adds a nice vibe for evening hangouts. Good place for a relaxed evening with friends!"
3,"Ambience is nice, it is too affordable. But quality of food isn't up to the mark also very less options for veg. Taste was ok ..and considering ambience 600 was ok"
4,A quiet place to have dinner with family. A tempting array of snacks in Buffet. Costs 750 plus tax. Food was excellent although there was less number of dishes to choose from... Overall I liked the place & would like to return.
4,Peaceful place in powai for dining. Less crowded. Should have more options in starters.
2,"The restaurant is located inside lanes near Hiranandani. You might get using google maps while reaching here. Serves Buffet. Buffet was ok, there is not much variety in cuisine, doesn't have chicken biryani in nonveg buffet. Overall Average."
5,We stayed at The Beatle for 03 nights. Food here is awesome.
1,I had ordered a chicken roll and it was full of green chillies . Just could not eat after two bites. There was no mention of spicy in the menu nor did the waiter said anything. Worst service too even after telling the food wasn‚Äôt good no effort to make it right. Got stomach ache with two bites of very spicy dish. They don‚Äôt even deserve one rating with their price point and food quality. Pls never go here to waste your money . Worst food in Powai
4,"For lunch today I have ordered from Kareem's.
Heard alot of time about this place but today finally able to place a order for it.
I have ordered:
Murg Reshmi Tikka : It was too good and mouth watering.
Boneless Murg Dum Biryani: This too was perfect in taste and good in quantity.

Overall loved it."

Coming to the food. It's quite good. But not sooo good .
.they have to work on their services."
5,People who cannot resist having non vegetarian food gotta visit this place which is situated at Hiranandani Powai. I've tried three dishes which i must say was really mouth watering and delicious.
3,"Just as the lockdown was uplifted here in MUMBAI. I was searching for a nice place to hop in for biryani.

I had very high hopes with this biryani place.

Well ofcourse the price was according to the location it is situated in. But I out of the biryani , murg mussallam and mutton roll. Just the roll was a bit that pleased me.

But as this is a biryani place was hoping to taste some mouth watering ‡§ú‡§æ‡§Ø‡§ï‡•á‡§¶‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§¨‡§ø‡§∞‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä.

Very reasonable pricing and affordable to most people, which is rare in a place like Powai.
The quality is good for what you pay, hence it's very popular for orders online."
4,"The cakes and pastries are very rich in taste and quality. Cakes and pastries don't have too much of bread like other cake shops which is the best part of this place.
They've non-veg and veg. snacks options as well which are fresh and are very appetizing.

Price of affordable and it matches the quality, taste and quantity you get in return.

Service is quick but the staff is a bit arrogant and that's the thing they can work on to improve the overall customer experience."
5,Top Class is an understatement. Must visit this place.
4,"I love Ribbons and  Balloons pastry and cakes. Esp chocolate cakes..why? Because they are not dense  like most bakeries.
They have this wonderful texture to their cake that is very filling and light at the same time and the cream is lovely with just the right  amount of chocolate layering. They have a good range of flavors,  not many but sensible range.
The savouries were good at one time but don't interest me much now. It is more bread than filling. They had a lovely spinach paneer roll  and lovely quiche but is missing from their menu now. Potato chips are of good quality .
Overall nice and I hope they stay afloat amidst rising competition.

For me, it's Ribbons and Balloons for great taste and complete value for money.."
1,"I was so fool
Today i brought egg puff without egg inside
I felt so bad when i took chicken puff along with it for a try. Egg was my fav and it wasnt there inside."
4,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Mirchi and Mime, a fine dine restaurant that exceeds expectations. The moment you step in, you're enveloped in a premium atmosphere, complete with comfortable seating.

What truly sets Mirchi and Mime apart is its commitment to social responsibility. The restaurant employs deaf and mute individuals as waiters, providing them with a unique opportunity for employment. To facilitate communication, the menu includes a set of signs that you can use to place your order. I was thoroughly impressed by this initiative and applaud the restaurant for its efforts.

Now, onto the food! We began with the Bangla Paneer Tikka, which looked stunning but unfortunately fell short in terms of taste. We couldn't finish it, which was disappointing.

However, the Dori Kebab more than made up for it. Essentially a seekh kebab wrapped around a dori, it was incredibly juicy and flavorful.

For our main course, we opted for the Veg Tahiri Biryani, which was good but not quite what I'd call a biryani. The Thalapakati Mutton Biryani, on the other hand, was outstanding. The mutton was surprisingly boneless and of exceptional quality and quantity.

The sides they provided with the Mutton Biryani were truly exceptional. The fried chips in curd were absolutely divine - I couldn't get enough of them! What impressed me even more was the thoughtful service. The staff noticed how much I enjoyed the sides and offered me a second serving without me even having to ask. It's little touches like these that make a dining experience truly memorable.

As the afternoon wore on, the restaurant filled up, even on a weekday. While Mirchi and Mime is certainly on the pricier side, the unique experience and delicious food make it well worth a visit."
5,"Mirchi & Mime - there is so much to write about this beautiful place known for many unique stuff, which is in addition to some of the best in food.

Me and my entire family is fan of this place that is also known for training and employing deaf üßè üßè‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è personnel, highly proficient in sign language.

Team is extremely well trained and hospitable to the core. They can develop a communication channel and a bond much faster than even someone with voice and rich vocabulary. Met two wonderful gentlemen Hasan & Nandan (both 5 üåü) who were catering to us. I won‚Äôt mind visiting the place again just to converse with them. The restaurant gifts you a small carry home card that lists various gestures & their meaning.

For food. You just can‚Äôt miss Mirchi & Mime. Their menu is extremely rich and as always, this time too, we went for set menu to ensure we can try maximum from menu.

While food served is 10/10 and preparation very unique; their presentation is also their high point. Simply loved ü•∞ it !!

Try their kebabs, fish preparations, desserts and much much more. One will require many visits to taste little something from their expansive menu. Did I miss mentioning desserts, try Sitaphal Pina Cota; absolutely delicious.

Restaurant is designed very well and offers a bright spacious look. They have a rich bar serving cocktails and other beverages.

Give in to the foodie in you and head to Mirchi & Mime, thank me later ü•òüç∏üçö

Note for Management- Your set menus could be tweaked a bit to combine Non Veg & Seafood specialities into one. May be add that as 4th option on your list."
5,"The staff is amazing, the food is great, 10/10 just go to this place. The ambience is perfect for a chill dinner with your parents. Reserve the table in advance to get the table inside the restraint. Outdoor sitting is good but, if you have a problem with cigarette smoke, you might have to book in advance!

Go for it! You won‚Äôt regret ü§ó"
5,"Mirchi & Mime is an Indian restaurant in Powai, Mumbai that has a unique concept: the staff is all deaf and mute, and they communicate with customers through sign language, delicious food, excellent service, and warm and welcoming atmosphere.

The restaurant is popular, so it is a good idea to make a reservation in advance.
The food is slightly expensive.
The restaurant is closed on Mondays.
I do not recommend chicken lollipops, not worth to even try.
Amristari fish tikka is my favourite."
5,"This place is a must-visit. The staff are speech and hearing impaired, providing a unique and enriching experience. The food quality is exceptional. It's a completely new experience, and everyone is sure to enjoy it. Since it often gets crowded, it's advisable to book your seats in advance to avoid waiting. Outdoor seating is also available.
The staff here is well trained and so good. They also give you a sign card to take along."
4,"Italian cuisine. Food is yummy. Doughballs dopio is simply favorite. Beverages can be improved.

Feels overpriced.

Pro tip- Before booking table on swwigy/zomato with fees, check the restaurant offers.

4,"Love the ambience and the lighting here. Everything we ordered was super delicious and the service time was short. The Prawn skewers were cooked to perfection, you could taste the masala and the prawns were not overcooked. The spaghetti was very tasty and filling. Would definitely visit again."
3,"Went in here for a office team lunch with a prior booking on Zomato however got to know that restaurant also provides their in house discount based on office ID cards (do check on this before visiting)

Ambiance is good and classy. Menu is bit overwhelming so do check with staff before ordering. We order couple of starters and pizza. Service was very very slow!

Pizza took more than 30 minutes, as the place was busy churning out delivery orders at priority it seems. In starters, I liked their Chicken Wings - the outer layering was perfect crisp and had good flavours. Red sauce Pasta was a disappointment - flavour was too tangy for me personally.

In pizza, the non veg one (forgot the name) tasted nice. The base was thin and marinara sauce as base was fresh and elevated the pizza. The veg pizza however was disappointing too many salad leafs were just planted on top of pizza which just didn't look good let alone the taste. Had to literally keep some of them aside. Presentation needs improvement.

Overall we had a decent meal here, prices are bit high but discount deal helps. Cheers!"
3,"Pizza Express offers a comfortable and familiar dining experience, delivering consistent quality and a taste of classic Italian flavors. Our recent visit focused on their vegetarian offerings, and we were generally pleased with the experience.

We started with the Veg Crispers. These were a delightful appetizer ‚Äì crispy, golden-brown bites with a medley of vegetables. They were well-seasoned and provided a satisfying crunch. The portion size was generous, and the accompanying dips complemented the flavors well.
For pizza option, we tried Rosemary Mushroom Pizza in Romana style. The Romana base was thin and crispy, just as we expected. The mushrooms were flavorful and the rosemary added a fragrant, earthy note."
4,"I‚Äôve been visiting this outlet for almost a decade now, the interiors have changed few times, and has gone from premium luxury looking to now a diners spot. The ambiance is fine, however, the last when I visited had few flies on the table and the servers were helpless too. 3/5 for atmosphere

The staff is very good and attentive. We were server by Sana who recommended us good options and was warm and friendly. 5/5 on service

Tried the Burrata, IL Padrino, Calabrese Veg and Tiramisu. Liked Burrata and Padrino is recommended for folks on a low carb diet.
Calabrese was spicy and avoidable.
Had extremely high hopes with Tiramisu but it turned out to be a disappointment. 3/5 on food

Pizza Express you guys need to buck up to compete with Si Nonas!

Overall a 3/5 on vfm."
4,"Aromas combines amazing vibes and excellent food!

They offer a variety of dishes and beverages for a meal at any time of the day! The preparation and presentation is top notch.

Being popular, this place was packed even at 10 in the morning.

However the requests to the waiter were often overlooked and consequently the waiting time was considerable."
5,"Had the best food and time with my friends . Music was the usual Shawn Mendes and Taylor Swift. Good vibes and relaxing.. we weren't rushed to eat and leave, unlike many popular places, and could savour the food. We ate quite a few items, it's a little on the expensive side but good to get"

Aromas in Powai presents a diverse menu, spanning from caf√© classics to international dishes, creating a vibrant and varied dining experience.
The Cappuccino was a satisfying start, well-balanced was served with a small cookie. The Cold Coffee, however, was a bit underwhelming, lacking the richness and intensity we expected.

Fries
The fries were standard, crispy and well-salted

Avocado Avalanche
the creamy avocado combined with other fresh ingredients creating a refreshing and flavorful appetizer, however lacks a bit of taste.

Loaded Nachos
These were a generous portion, but the cheese distribution was uneven, and some chips were left dry. It was served with salsa dip.

Creamy Garlic Prawns
This was a definite highlight. The prawns were cooked to perfection, tender and juicy, and the creamy garlic sauce was rich and flavuorful.

Spaghetti Arrabiata
The sauce had a good kick and the pasta was cooked al dente, served with 2 slices of garlic bread

Alfredo Penne
This was creamy and comforting, though it could have benefited from a bit more seasoning.

Thai Green Curry
Thai Green Curry was a mixed bag. While the flavors were present, it lacked the depth and complexity of an authentic Thai curry.

Classic Waffles
These were a delightful treat. They were light and fluffy, and the were served with Maple syrup, banana slices and a dollop of whipped cream.

Tiramisu
This was a disappointment. It lacked the rich coffee flavor and creamy texture we expected.

5,"I have tried both their vegetarian and non-vegetarian pizzas, and they were both delicious. They offer a wide variety for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. The quality of their pizza is excellent, and they provide good service. With pizzas available in various sizes and prices, you can find pocket-friendly options to try. I highly recommend this outlet to all pizza lovers. Though it's a small place with limited seating, their pizzas are incredibly tasty. Additionally, they have exciting offers to enhance your dining experience. Also they really know how to satisfy your pizza cravings with their flavorful toppings and perfectly baked crusts. Plus, their friendly staff adds to the overall enjoyable experience. Whether you're dining in or ordering for delivery, you're guaranteed a delightful pizza feast every time."
5,"Best pizza delivery place for casual eats/occasion!

Earlier I used to be stuck eating [Generic Pizza Brand] which has too much crust and barely any toppings on pizza. Then I found out about this place about a few years ago and now it has become my go to pizza place.
The pizzas here are amazing, has a perfect balance of toppings and the crust. Toppings are chunky and plenty. The crust is uniform and isn‚Äôt too dry.

One thing to remember is to call and order. If you order a combo or a regular pizza from online ordering apps, they‚Äôll handle it haphazardly and try to cut delivery cost by carrying the pizza in a normal bag instead of a pizza bag."
5,The outlet is good enough to hold 10-12 ppl at a tym . The pizzas are amazing with apt quantity and are delectable ‚ù§Ô∏è. Love the Sizzling panner pizza. The garlic bread was complimentary as their in house offer which was amazing üòä. Would love to visit again
4,Their delivery service is real quick. And they got a great spread of pizza too. Meal plans are more than enough for two people. Loved their fare.
4,Pizza Caprina is a delivery kitchen based in Chembur. Delivery was on time and the packaging was good. Their pizza are really commendable. I ordered the Paneer Chilli Medium Cheese Burst. The pizza was really good and comparable to dominoes.  Pizza had good filling and the base was super cheesy. Loved It.
1,"I'd give negative stars if I could. I ordered two medium premium pizzas (butter chicken and special) with extra cheese and received anything that doesn't look or taste premium or extra, to be honest it was barely anything and I paid Rs 1250 for that. I've ordered pizzas from several places but always received good quality and quality even when I've paid Rs 900 at other places (dominoes, mojo, Eva, monster pizza etc) this was seriously worst I've received for the money that I paid. Ordering from this place has shaken my habit of trying pizzas from new places once in a while, absolutely pathetic."
4,I would describe the pizzas as above average. The toppings are good. Price too is average. Would highly recommend getting medium sized pizzas.
5,I took my parcel from here..... Zesty chicken is my favourite from here if you like tangy flavour. Smokin Joe's special loaded is also good to go with.
5,"Amazing taste with quality ingredientsüëå
Hot chicken pizza üçï üíõ"
3,Very small restaurant. Not so good pizzas n very high prizes . Over ratted restaurant

1,"Horrible waffle. I am a huge fan of Belgian waffles. This branch of Belgian waffles is the wort branch. I ordered triple chocolate from here today itself. They already had made the waffle it was so dry and stale. I had asked for soft waffle. But I received a stale waffle, not at all soft, dry and horrible. Other branches are great but this chembur branch provides stale waffle to the customers. Kindly look into it and the employees should know not to provide customers with stale waffles who paid for a high quality nice hot waffle."
3,"The waffle of belgium waffle Chembur is awesome always but today when we went to belgium waffle to order there is one staff her behaviour towards us was not good By mistake water fell from us and she told us to take wiper from outside and clean it
Is this behaviour is good? Are we supposed to clean that? We're customer it's not good and at the end we also clean that while we're coming in Belgium waffle she even doesn't welcome us not even a single smile? Is this is hospitality ? From Belgium waffle Not expected
Pls do something it's not right and the day was (Thursday 13 of March 2025) timing 12:47  and waffle is awesome üíØ"
5,"They have come up with new flavours in their Waffle along with the base being a brownie base. Totally loved the almond Brownie Waffle and walnut Brownie Waffle.
Riceh decedent filling and worth the money . Do checkout their new launched flavours ."

5,"‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Wok Hei is a small gem on the main road in Chembur! While parking can be a bit tricky, the experience is worth it. It's not a fancy restaurant, but the place is decent and has its own charm.

We tried the Tibetan Chicken Soup ‚Äì a thin, slightly spicy soup that was packed with flavor. The Burnt Chicken Rice was also delicious, and the pricing was very reasonable.

If you're looking for something different and tasty, Wok Hei is definitely worth a try. We'll be coming back for sure!"
5,"Theirs was the best noodles I've had in Mumbai. We visited during lunch and they have a BuyOneGetOne offer from 12-7pm. We ordered Hakka Chicken, Veg Manchurian, Chilli garlic noodles and Burnt chilli noodles.

Everything was flavorsome and the noodles were so thin and every strand was a flavor Bomb.

To top it all, the place has great hospitality. We were served by Krishna (I hope I remember the name correctly) and the manager Mr. Dev was also very polite and helped us with our request.

The quantity was so good that we had to get a takeaway and have it for dinner. And our total bill came to ‚Çπ557 ONLY

If you're in and around the Chembur area, you must try here once. Their flat noodles are also great."
4,"I was craving for some authentic chinese food, so we have decided to visit this place. This place is ongoing March offer ##buy1get1free. Ambience is good and the food was presented very well. The staff is polite and seatings are very comfortable. Their quantity is also very nice, one dish can share in 2 people easily.

We ordered :
Lollipop Masala
Sizzled Chicken Chilli
Crispy Chicken
Dragon Chicken
Thai Basil Prawns

Must visit this place."
4,"Delicious Indo-Chinese restaurant with a plethora of variety

The USP of Wok hei is that you get to order food in Half portion size, this way you can try out more things without getting full. We went ahead with Dragon Chicken, basa fish fry, Mongolian chicken soup, paneer chilly. All dishes were decent with dragon and the soup notably standing out with their distinct taste.
For drinks I recommend you try their Lemon/Peach Mojito.
Main course was a portion of Singapore chilly rice and oyster sauce gravy.

Ambience wise the place was packed and crowded with a lot of bustle.
They were out of Chicken Lollipops! ü•≤"
3,"The food was better than the typical fare available elsewhere, but not all the way authentic. The ingredients used were as advertised (which doesn't really happen everywhere), but the cooking was just about ok. In all fairness, it is really difficult to  get authentic flavour of foreign dishes in India.

The restaurant offers both small and large portions of most items, and the server was forthcoming enough to guide us to split the small portion amongst us as there were only two of us. It fitted the other reviews of the portion sizes being large.

We ordered small portions of Plum Chilli crisp potato, Veg Pad Thai noodles and veg pan fried momos. The potatoes were supposed to be sweet and sour, but the flavour was way too mild. Couldn't taste the plum at all. The potatoes were hard rather than crisp. That dish was a disappointment.
The Veg Pad  Thai noodles had the right kind of noodles and the right flavours, but some ingredients were replaced by a sauce that made them too wet. Could have been better but I have had worse üòä
The veg pan fried momos could have been a real winner. The outer layer was really thin and perfectly crispy, not hard like it is at some other outlets. If only the chef had been a little innovative with the filling instead of overloading it with cabbage. I have recently had momos in Arunachal Pradesh, and the filling  makes all the difference.
There were two pastes on the tables along with the vinegar that were quiet good. One of the servers shared one was a green chilli paste, but it didn't taste like it. It tasted like a very yummy combination of spring onions with something. Was a good accompaniment.

The ambience was good and well maintained, except for the mosquitoes. They brought out the raquet by the end of our meal, but the experience was spoilt by then. Even the AC was kept off in this high heat of May and was switched on only after we requested.There were no napkins and tissues were provided on request.

The staff was very polite and helpful. One guy in particular was well versed with the dishes and the portion sizes and helped us place the right order. They were much better trained than staff generally is at such places, and were making a real effort.

It was quite an inexpensive place, as the total bill for these three items which were enough for the two of us came to less than ‚Çπ700. The best thing was that they did not add a default service charge and we could tip based on the service.
I think I would still visit again, with more tempered expectations.

Best to order North East Indian dishes as the chef was from that area and those dishes are likely to be more authentic."
4,"Visited after lock down still the place has the best fires n sauces good combos with fries

Good place a take away so no seating place available
Good quality of fries üçü with very üòã
Sauses to go with

5,Very nice place for different tasty varieties of fries.
4,"My all time favourite place to have fries, randomly I visited here .. the fries so tasty and yummy. Would recommend to try Mayo chilli fries it's my favourite located in chembur near diamond garden. Have lot's of options in fries, maggi fries available too.
Must visit"
1,The oil being used is very bad. Smell your fingers after eating it and i bed its not good. I will not suggest to have this because of the bad oil. Rest all is good.
5,Taste of the food is awesome but there is no sitting arrangement. But overall very great experience.
5,"Vaishali Garden Restaurant is conveniently located near Chembur Station. While the streets can feel quite crowded, the valet parking service is a great solution. The restaurant is situated on the first floor, which might be a concern for elderly visitors, but thankfully, there is a lift available.

The ambience is inviting both inside and outside. Being a garden restaurant, it offers an open terrace seating option, while the indoor area has a cozy atmosphere, making it ideal for any season. The aroma of spices as we entered heightened our appetite.

We began our meal with the welcome munchies,,, boiled peanuts, which were a nice touch. For starters, we ordered chicken tikka and paneer tikka, both of which were flavorful. Since we opted for a Chinese theme for the evening, we followed up with noodles, fried rice, and dry Manchurian gravy. Despite the restaurant being jam-packed, with people even waiting outside, the service was impressively prompt.

The quality of the food was excellent, and the service deserves full marks. While Vaishali Garden Restaurant falls into the premium category and might seem a bit pricey, it‚Äôs worth every penny. We made sure to reserve our table in advance for 8:30 PM, which ensured a seamless dining experience.

I‚Äôm sharing a photo of a clock crafted on the backside of a kadhai,‚Ä¶a unique and artistic touch that adds to the charm of the place."
4,"Exceptional service, wonderful taste, i highly recommend this restaurant. Absolutely phenomenal."
4,"We went for dinner on weekday Apr 2024 and restaurant was almost empty near the roof area. It had multiple sections such as Roof Open space with candle light, AC section, Party hall. We had to approach security guard standing near to our table to call the waiter as they took more than 5 min for the service staff to come and provide the water and menu card. All the restaurant waiters and staff were busy watching IPL match. Thus, service was not good we observed at start only.

We ordered fresh lime soda which was bit ok. Starters we had Chicken Jalandari Kebab which was good in taste. Main course we had Butter Naan & chicken Afghani which came in red thick gravy and was yummy too. Thus, if service could have been better then it might be excellent dine out experience for us.
Note: Parking space is bit issue as it is located near Chembur Station which is usually crowded and no parking on road side."
5,"Have fond memories this restaurant having lived in Chembur... superb garden restaurant elegantly spaced out and ideal for Bday parties especially during winter...the air-conditioned restaurant is cosy and has a great feel to it...

The food be it starters or main course is yummy and the service is quick, the staff is polite and well mannered...

Worth checking in in case you haven't done it already.."
4,"The place is near by chembur station, those coming by car will get an valet parking.

Staff is good and place is awesome. Situated on the first floor it has outdoor and indoor seating capacity.

Also party hall is available on pre booking term.

Food is good, but the quantity is bit low also the price is bit over priced.

Ambience is mast you will enjoy it.

Haven‚Äôt visited in recent time, but this is an lovely place.

And if you want to see old vintage Mercedes, the owner car is parked in the parking area reserved for owner only.

Rest staff is good"
1,Ordered from Zomato.. Pickup partner was waiting at restaurant for 1/2 hour.. Restaurants phone not working so could not call them. Ordered delayed. Pickup person said they have taken too much of orders and not able to deliver. After so much of waiting we got tasteless food. Would like to share the pic of one dish. What they are showing at Zomato and what they delivered. Very Upsetting and unprofessional. Would give zero stars.
3,"Wok express needs to improve their food quality. No matter their hospitality is nice, but it becomes necessary to improve the taste as well. Had their Veg Schezwan Noodles and my friend had their Burnt Chilly Garlic Fried Rice(Non Veg)
The taste of the noodles could‚Äôve been much much better.
Ambience is pretty nice."
4,"Craving for some delicious Chinese or Asian cuisines- give this place a try. A perfect place for your cravings. Tried few of the food items along with drinks. It was a good experience.

Spicy garlic chicken: chicken pieces tossed in the wok and mixed well with the spices. However taste failed to bring any charm, but for the garlic feel it can be given a try.

Schezwan chicken bao: delicious and that's all. Two pieces of baos in one serving. The schezwan feel was great. A must try.

Crunchy vegetable dumpling: Comes in with sweet, cheesy, and tangy sauce. Dumplings were delicious. Soft and luscious.

Assorted vegetable dumplings: This one with was schezwan sauce. Better than the previous dumpling choice.

Crunchy chicken dumpling: With sweet, tangy, and cheesy sauce, the Dumpling goes well. However the crunchiness was missing, yet the dumplings are worth giving a try.

Minty mojito: A disaster. Not a good choice. Missed the mint feel. Not recommend.

Peach ice tea: Again, not a great choice. I feel, they put more emphasis on food than on the drinks. Just simple and plain without peach feel.

Lemon ice tea: This was the third drink, I tried, and again disappointment is what I got.

Veg personal bowl: A great option to choose from. In bowl options, you can choose your base as per your requirement. With base, you can choose the sauce of your choice and toppings of your choice. I tried multigrain noodles with fried onions, burnt garlic, crushed peanuts, spring onions. In veggies, I had baby corn, zucchini, mushroom. This bowl was one of the best things, I had at this place. A highly recommend option.

Overall, this place is wonderful if you want to cherish your taste buds with Asian and Chinese cuisines. The drinks however disappointed us a bit, the food nicely covered up for that."
5,"I ordered below
veg momos tossed manchurian sauce- made to perfection perfectly deep fried and great have

Veg ramen noodles in teriyaki sauce with carrot-
Cannot ask for more awesome dish then this one I simply felt loved with it. Noodles were fresh and soft cooked to perfection. Tossed in teriyaki sauce.

Quality- good
Quantity- enough for one
Recommended- hell yeah !!!"
2,"I ordered food from this restaurant, and while it initially seemed fine, the quality was clearly not up to standard. Shortly after eating, I began to feel very uncomfortable and ended up vomiting.

I won‚Äôt be ordering from this place again and would advise others to think twice before doing so."

So I went to pick up the food and was shocked to see the state of the Restaurant. The unhygienic way the Pizzas were being prepared. Flies all around the Dough which was thrown on the table, the way the cheese was being thrown and put back in the containers. How the full restaurant tables was filled with leftover food boxes. The floor...... I can continue forever. I dint have the courage to eat the Pizzas, my order which was given to me. Never expected such a horrible experience from Domino's....."

4,Visited here for lunch. Much quieter compared to dinner time. Dim light and comfy setting. Nice instrumental music. Food is great and so are the drinks. They always have some drinks etc offers going. Their Indian cuisine is really good. There is no parking or valet so plan accordingly.
5,"Blend N Brew Restro Bar is an amazing place that offers top-notch food and service. The ambience is delightful, creating a perfect setting for both parties and family gatherings. The staff is attentive and accommodating. With a varied range of alcohol and delicious vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, the taste is simply outstanding. The added conveniences of parking and a designated smoking area enhance the overall experience, making it a go-to destination for a memorable time."
4,"Nice restrobar in the area. Ambience was good if not great. Snacks are particularly very delicious which is the main highlight of this place. Drinks prices are a bit on a higher side, but considering the locality it may seem OK. Can consider for last moment party plans."
4,"A place to visit for food, enjoyment and good music. Ambience was good. We had salt & pepper prawns and chicken kebab starters, both were amazing. Mojito was ok 3/5. Chicken pot rice which was recommended by hotel it was not that good. It was bit sweet in taste & with too much of veggies included in it which brought down some fun at end.
We loved the bollywood music played with ipl match on other screen, hope there was a dance floor as music was awesome.
Service was too late and was brought to the notice, post that next items were served bit early. First dish to arrive took more than 40+ minutes.
Overall a good experience and look forward to see the change in service else it was fantastic."
4,"Only reason I‚Äôm giving this place 4 ‚≠êÔ∏è is for their food. The veg dim sums and veg biryani were too good.

Their service is lethargic, slow and inattentive. They have a lack of parking space. First they said they have the ordered beers then they say they do not. Then they take another 10 min to take the new order, you have to call them continuously to place orders.

The watchman there is also very rude and not doing his job well."

5,"Box8 has always been a goto option when I'm looking for some tasty and delicious food to silence my appetite.

Their wide variety always offers a good choice to select from, whether you're going to have something healthy or something drooling that you cannot resist.

Wraps, fusion boxes, biryani, meals, desserts, there is such a wide variety to choose from and he quantity has always been so awesome and the prices are affordable.

Last week we had ordered from here and what we had included,

1. Chicken Tikka Biryani
2. Chicken Xxl Wrap
3. Superfit Chicken Salad
4. Shahu Paneer Biryani
5. Spicy Kebab Box
6. Paneer Masala Box
7. Dal Makhani Rice Box
8. Murg Dum Biryani

Well it seems that considering all Biryani options, what they've put as the second element like for chicken tikka biryani, the amount of chicken pieces were not satisfying so I hope they would consider the change.

For the rest I would say the salad was really delicious and fresh, chicken sausages were put in perfect amount with all the veggies.

And their fusion boxex have always been my first priority, considering the quantity and the contents.

Do give it a try."

Chicken Tikka Over Box
This box serves 2 people easily as the chicken and rice are given in quite good quantity. The chicken tikka was delicious and the salad, garlic mayo and green chutney was tasty. This is easily my favourite.

1,"Review for MoJo Pizza - Chembur Outlet

I had the worst experience with MoJo Pizza at the Chembur outlet. It took over 1 hour just to prepare 3 small pizzas, followed by another 30-minute delivery time. By the time it arrived, the pizza was almost cold, and most of it ended up uneaten as it was not enjoyable at all.

The taste was just okay, but the quality was completely overshadowed by the unacceptable wait time and the cold food. Moreover, their contact number was switched off, making it impossible for me to reach them and address the issue.

This level of service is highly disappointing, and they urgently need to work on both timely delivery and customer support."

4,Budget hotel to dine in Chembur market. I enjoyed the best of food and hospitality here last to last day. It was worth to come and have a thali to dine. It was too much to finish for me single handedly. The service of the restaurant was comfortable and timely. The Dosa was good to Cherish the food. The sad part was attendant was not responding well. Enjoyed the meal though. The best part of this restaurant is it's crowdeded and you can trust as there many people who come to eat food and meal.

4,"Visited here to shop, but was unable to play without a members invitation.  Course is a members only facility where golf is considered very exclusive in india. It's executive length within the city makes it a shorter experience. Didn't play, but appear to have good practice facilities. Club area and dining is quaint, appropriate for India, but dont expect to see the Western style club facilities. The added facilities are what make the membership premium. The pro shop was in renovation and little to see. Getting to the course is quite challenging in a less than glamorous, congested, less attractive area outside of the course wall. All staff are friendly and inviting and welcoming. Will nerdvto find a member invite on my next trip."
4,"Once a month, we rent the hall on the second floor for our live orchestra music sessions followed by dinner. The food is good."
5,"We visited this club with a new friend who invited us last weekend. It's a beautiful place, so green and with various places to sit, eat, enjoy. There is a lovely pool with quite a deep end which is unique, many other pools in Mumbai are not so deep. The cafe which I'm told is new had a great range of food, a tasty cobb salad as well as Vietnamese Coffee which had a nice kick. The kids enjoyed the pasta dishes such as mac and cheese. There is also a bar which I'm told has dances and functions, I hope to visit one of these in the future!"
4,"The most beautiful location in all of Mumbai with lush greens, great golfing facilities, a fabulous swimming pool, and comfortable rooms on rent for members.

The food menu has remained the same over the years. It needs refreshing.

The service in the restaurant as well as the lawn is too slow, and they tend to even forget orders at times. However, Anand, the supervisor, and Dinesh, the service staff and some of his colleagues, work hard at customer delight. Polite and respectful at all times.

Parking is available only for members, so it is a tad challenging to offer it to guests, but that is less of the problem.

The swimming pool is squeaky clean and mildly heated at all times. It is a pleasure to use the pool.

The changing room staff is way too talkative. They push a conversation on you. If not, they speak too loudly amongst themselves.

Changing room and other housekeeping staff needs to be trained in being silent and professional in their ways. The same applies to the 'library' on the 2nd and 3rd floors. They are noisy as staff keep walking around talking loudly. And it's less of a library as it is built on an empty corridor space. It's more like a work area and quite tastefully done up.

Overall, the elegance and old-world charm of this club is its all-time attraction despite the service challenges."
5,"Mani's Lunch Home in Chembur near Saibaba Mandir next to Malhaar restaurant. Every visit is a culinary treat to the tastebuds. Dosa items, Idli, Vada, Onion Adai, Ragi dosa, Chettinad Dosa, Curry Leaves Dosa, South Indian Thali and many other items - always taste the best. The servers and rest of the staff is always quick, courteous and hygienic.
One needs to also try their sweets - Boondi Laddoo, Jangiri, Balusha, Rava laddoo - they are yummy, delicious and very savory
Not to forget the Pineapple Sheera, which is another delight for your taste buds."
4,Even on a weekday the restaurant was crowded. We arrived just in time when there were a few seats still available. When we came out there was a long queue. We opted for thali which is quite good and amount is sufficient. It is a limited thali with unlimited Sambhar. Service is quick.
5,"Absolutely Divine Experience!
The food here is simply awesome and soul-satisfying. The taste is exactly the same as it was 25 years ago ‚Äî authentic, consistent, and truly delicious. Every dish is prepared with great care, bringing out rich, traditional flavors that are hard to find these days.

If you're looking for a place that serves timeless, quality food that reminds you of home-cooked meals from the past, this is it. A wonderful experience that leaves you completely satisfied!"
5,"Authentic South Indian meals & Tiffin snacks to eat. Very well known name and famous family business started in Matunga near Ruia College,  Regards"
5,"Mani's lunch home üè†
Wow!!! First time
Nostalgic moment of childhood rice, sambhar and speciality of mani's customer service and promptly dealt with relationships.
The taste was awesome and I will surely visit again and again with family members and friends in the near future."
1,"I was surprised when the barista, Ritesh, informed me that the meat/chicken served here isn‚Äôt halal. For a brand that positions itself as inclusive and welcoming to everyone, this was disappointing. However I must mention that he himself was very polite and extremely respectful."
1,"Had gone there today for dinner and some work. Had booking through Dineout at 7:30 pm. I had reached 10 mins before. Ordered coffee, but was not able to pay through dineout since payment slot opens only after 7:30 pm. So i requested them to make coffee and i said i ll pay after 5 mins, after the payment is enabled on dineout. But the cashier and store manager rudely asked to me come after 5 mins. I let this behaviour pass. Then i requested for a pen since i needed to write something urgently. But again was rudely denied. Since my laptop was already set on the table, i requested him to watch over for a few minutes so that i can run to the neighbouring medicine shop and get a pen. Again i was greeted with a no. The rude behaviour was really irritating and hence i skipped ordering and left the place. Really hate to say when brands like starbucks, third wave coffee and blue tokai are offering excellent quality and service, old classics like Barista are unable to do even offer basic courtesy and service. I would understand if the store was crowded, but the store was not even crowded and such poor service is disgusting."
5,"I have been a Barista , Chembur customer for over an year now, almost every day minimum I spend 5 hours here. The good thing about this place is the coffee is very good and they have option of payment through Swiggy or Zomato Gold where you can avail discounts ranging between 30 to 50 percent of the Bill except for bottled Beverages. There are charging points in almost all the tables , hence very comfortable to take the laptop and work. The Bad things are : 1. There is no parking space 2: There is only one rest room which is almost all the time occupied most probably by the Barista staff itself  3: When there are incoming calls from the Customers for booking orders their phone is connected to the house speakers and the ring is too loud and creates a disturbance.
Overall, it is a nice place , strategically located and good place for  having business meeting, social meetings and also spending long hours."
1,"Hello I‚Äôm srinivas , I visited the union park barista on 30th April at 11am
We ordered the chilly cheese toast , spinach and corn sandwich and iced latte. The chilly cheese toast bread was stale and the cheese quality was horrible, the spinach and corn sandwich felt expired and it was tasteless, the coffee took 20 after the food to arrive cause they forgot my order . This is just poor services and not acceptable we were quite hungry and the food didn‚Äôt reach the mark as we expected. We are feeling nauseous and not well after the meals."
4,"It's a wonderful place to have coffee the snacks are fine alot of muffins stuffs are available here.
There's two option to make onself comfortable that is sit out n enjoy the business of the world n the other is relax inside with all calmness.The staff  are welcoming.
There's also washroom available"
4,"Today we went for lunch there where we ordered paneer chilly, Gobi Manchurian as starters and veg biriyani as main course and after, a gulab jamun ..Gobi Manchurian was not able to rectify my taste spot while the paneer chilly, veg biryani and gulab jamun was a Typical pakka north indian which was outstanding, (As I'm from South i can feel the difference between the masalaüòÖ) Staff behaviour was soo polite and was able to clear all our doubts and help us to order nicely! Ambience also well maintained üëçüèª"

4,Food was very tasty but the service was very slow. If u aren't hungry n want to spend time with ur loved ones with chit chat then u can visit this place.
5,"One of the oldest joints in chembur. Easy to access as it's on the main Rd and not deep in to chembur.This place has an open air section with live gazals most of the days. Private dining on the roof top. Ac section for quite conversations. Party area for small get-togethers . Food is upto the mark.
Good hospitality,the staff and owners are very humble and friendly.
Outside venue is sometime a bit noisy due to traffic as it's on the main road.

Overall 9/10"
4,"The place has an awesome ambiance. Outdoor sitting and good lights.

The best feature of the place is the uncle who sings Gazhals. Nothing like a rainy evening and a whiskey in hand and listening to Gazhals. It's the highlight of the place.

The food is decent and they mostly specialise in tandoor.

We ordered the chicken tandoori which fine. Butter chicken is textbook so it's the same like you get it everywhere. We had a clear chicken soup which was good.

The mocktails are good and well priced. It tastes good.

The place is a little expensive, and it gets a little noisy when there's a party. But otherwise it's an ideal for a family gathering or a date night. Indoors or outdoors."
1,"I recently ordered a cake pastry through Zomato on 28 Feb Unfortunately, the pastry was stale and had an overpowering flavor, making it unenjoyable. It‚Äôs poor quality, worst food, bad product, 2 3 day before making food sale, very bad experience with Ribbons and balloons, I really don‚Äôt order again this cake brand. Really bad experience . Plz don‚Äôt order from ribbons and balloons cake shops."
5,"Planning my parents 75th wedding anniversary was a momentous task. Choosing Ribbons & Balloons Chembur for their cake was the best decision ever. From the moment I stepped in, I felt like family. The team went above and beyond to ensure every detail was perfect. Their warmth and genuine care transformed a simple cake into a masterpiece leaving my guests speechless. It‚Äôs a place where dreams are baked into reality and where moments become cherished memories. Thank you for making my special day extraordinarily."
4,"A Sweet Delight - Ribbons and Balloons, The Cake Shop in Chembur. My visit to Ribbons and Balloons. This charming bakery is a paradise for anyone with a sweet tooth, offering a fantastic array of delectable treats and baked goods.

As soon as I entered the shop, I was greeted by an inviting and warm ambiance. The delightful aroma of fresh baking set a welcoming tone. The interior is cozy and beautifully decorated, creating a cheerful atmosphere that complements the joy of choosing a sweet treat.

The variety and quality of cakes at Ribbons and Balloons are exceptional. Each cake is a masterpiece, both in terms of flavor and presentation. From classic chocolate cakes to more exotic flavors, there is something to satisfy every palate. The pastries and cookies are also noteworthy, each item freshly baked and bursting with flavor.

What makes Ribbons and Balloons stand out is the freshness of their products. You can tell that only the finest ingredients are used, and the care put into baking each item is evident. The custom cake service is particularly impressive, perfect for special occasions when you want a cake that is both delicious and personalized to your preference.

The staff at Ribbons and Balloons were friendly and helpful, adding to the pleasant experience. They were knowledgeable about the products and offered recommendations that were much appreciated. Their efficiency in handling orders, especially custom requests, was commendable.

Additionally, the bakery maintains high standards of cleanliness and hygiene, which is reassuring and reflects their commitment to quality.

In summary, Ribbons and Balloons, The Cake Shop in Chembur, is a must-visit for anyone looking to indulge in high-quality, delicious baked goods. The combination of delightful cakes, a warm atmosphere, and excellent service makes for an outstanding experience."
1,"Worst experience ever. Only the synthetic cakes are edible. Don‚Äôt ever buy a seasonal cake from here. Cakes are usually 2-3 days old. And the people working here would never accept that the cake is bad.
Personal Experience- Bought a Mango Cake for Bday party. In evening realised that it was spoiled and not edible. The whole party was ruined. On top of that when I complained, they asked me to bring the cake to the shop and said they will have to send it to the factory for checking. Stupidest reason ever."
1,"I have been a loyal customer of your brand for many years, but my recent experience at your Chembur outlet has left me extremely disappointed and upset.

During my visit, I purchased a couple of pastries and was shocked by the rude and dismissive behavior of the manager, Amit. Not only did he fail to offer a carry bag‚Äîa basic customer courtesy‚Äîbut when I inquired, his response was unprofessional and completely lacking in respect.

I walked out of the store feeling insulted and disrespected. It‚Äôs incredibly disheartening to be treated this way, especially by someone in a managerial position who is expected to uphold the brand‚Äôs values and customer service standards. If this is the kind of experience loyal customers are subjected to, it reflects very poorly on the brand and its management.

I strongly urge the company to address this issue seriously. Such behavior will undoubtedly harm the brand‚Äôs reputation and customer trust in the long run."

We started with the Chinese starters, and I must say, they were incredibly flavorful. The crispy chicken lollipop masala,chicken 65üòö stood out as my favorite‚Äîan excellent balance of spice and crunch that left me wanting more.

For the main course, I opted for simple chicken fried rice, which was satisfyingly delicious and perfectly complemented the starters. What impressed me most was the affordability; despite being a small restaurant, the prices ‚Çπ ü§ëwere very reasonable.

Also the Live music was very entertaining. Nice place to hangout with your friend.

They only need to improve the speed of serving. Waiting for food and drinks irritates when you are hungry."

4,Today I went to Dadar McDonald which was almost crowded because it is in a market hub. Luckily I got a small table to enjoy my meal.. after settling for a while I ordered  the New Korean chicken surprise burger but after a bite  I can say  there was only the Korean sauce which was different from the other chicken burger. Nothing wow about it. But one can have plenty of options at  McDonalds so there is less chance of being disappointed..
5,Had a great experience with my recent McDonald's order! Arti took care of everything with such professionalism and a warm attitude. Her amazing hospitality truly made a difference. Thank you for the excellent service!

5,"Perfect shop to buy ladies products of lingerie, night wear. The sales people are very helpful and try their best to provide options and go out of their way. They have a great collection of night suits and night gowns too"
1,"My experience at this lingerie shop was a total letdown. First, they claimed to have the products I was interested in, even sending me pictures of them. However, within just 10-15 minutes, they completely reversed their stance, saying they no longer had the products.
I must also mention the rudeness of the staff/shop owner, which only added to the unpleasant shopping experience. First, they misled me about product availability, and then they displayed rude behavior. This shop is a complete disappointment, and I strongly advise everyone to steer clear of it.
Manish Chheda better learn some manners to talk with women‚Äôs and take responsibilities of your own commitments."
5,"Products are good upto the mark, i like the quality"
1,They are running a pure business and don't have any service to provide to the customers once they say sizes are available and when you drop the Qty they will not give you the sizes and no customer preference. Qty of 6-7pcs is very less for such people. She will show you the product saying it is available and waste your time and then the shop owner acts rude and throws tantrums like a small kid. RUDE AND SENSELESS. NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!!
1,"Very bad Service from this shop
I am buying all my garments from this from last 5 to 6 years but today one Bra size is not fitting properly so I call them for change but they answered that they can‚Äôt bcoz label is not there .. I just to say that itna time se koi shopping kr rha hai uska bhi ye log value nahi krte hai so guys pls do not buy from this shop and one more thing that they are costing too much money for their products..üò° and the owner is also so rude üò°"
5,"Amazing food, amazing service. Totally top notch and the prices are also at that level. A good place"
5,"We went to the pure veg restaurant. Slightly pricy. But the quantity is good. We ordered for pinacolada, Chinese bhel, veg fried rice and spring role. Everything was well prepared. Sumptuous in quantity but pricy. We paid 1800 for the same and we were two of us."
4,I had nice experience in this restaurant. Food was amazing. Nice ambience. Little bit expensive than average. Service was also good. Variety of menu is available. This restaurant serves both veg and non - veg food. There is restaurant next to this 'Peninsula - NXT ' which is pure veg. Must try.
5,"I just love this place  highly recommend it for non vegetarian lover, it‚Äôs ambiance is so good and it‚Äôs top notch service is welcoming and never disappoints to their customers, hygiene is taken care of by their staffs every single time and food is very good.Prices are usually high but worth spending!!!"
4,"Easily accessible pure veg restaurant located at Sion circle. We Visited this place for a Saturday lunch. Ambience and interiors are great. All tables had attractive fresh yellow roses.
They have a North Indian Chinese and Mexican options. Service was fast.
We ordered Masala papad which was good. For drinks we had blue lagoon and orange mojito which were perfectly blended for the hot afternoon. In starters we ordered zaafran and lahsuni tikka and it turned out to be delicious and juicy with adequate spices. Honey chilli potato was great too.
For main course we had vegetable biryani which was average. There were no accompaniment with biryani which was a bit disappointing. However the veg raita we ordered turned out great.
The prices are a bit on higher side (approx 2000‚Çπ for 2).
Overall it was a great lunch and enjoyed!"

Thank you"
5,Honestly very humble staff
5,"Nice options of cake available. The products are always fresh.Nice options of cakes, pastries and snacks. Some basic party apparatus available.
Pizza base and bread also available.
Can even pre order designer cakes as photo cake or theme cake."
5,Situated in Matunga East just at the roundabout this restaurant in business from 1936 serves one of the best authentic udupi delicacies at the most reasonable price. The quality of every single item is just marvelous. They have an Ac as well as Non Ac sections. Service is real fast as it's mostly always crowded (might have to wait for a table during evenings and afternoon). They also have one of the best filter coffee. There's a dedicated counter for take away packed namkeen/chips/farsan and sweets. Highly recommend if you are looking for a Value for Money gastronomic experience. This is a pure vegetarian restaurant.
5,"An authentic udupi style south indian restaurant. One of the oldest restaurant too. They give a small printout with 5 reasons why you should visit Cafe Mysore.

Food is the regular idli and dosa varieties and vada varieties. They also have a snack counter selling murukku, chips and South Indian sweets. The ground floor is non ac seating and the first floor has 2 ac seating halls. The place is clean and neat and the staff is friendly.

The ambiance said the age and heritage of this restaurant."
5,"Cafe Mysore ‚Äì Matunga, Mumbai
Tried the Peri Peri Masala Dosa, Rasam Idli, and Kotto Idli‚Äîeach dish brought something unique to the table. The Peri Peri Masala Dosa was a spicy twist on the classic, crisp on the outside with a fiery filling that packed a flavorful punch without overpowering the South Indian roots. The Rasam Idli stood out with its comforting warmth‚Äîsoft idlis soaking in tangy, spiced rasam made for a soothing, satisfying combo. The Kotto, steamed in jackfruit leaves, had an earthy aroma and delicate texture, offering a traditional taste rarely found elsewhere in Mumbai.

Service was quick, and the old-school charm of the place added to the experience. A great stop if you‚Äôre craving inventive yet authentic South Indian fare."
5,"Authentic South Indian cuisine!! Special are Khotto Idali (Konkani Idali steamed in Jackfruit leafs giving special taste) , Dilbahar Dosa and filter coffee are great taste!! Must tryüëç"
5,"Great dosa house!! Every time we visit India, this is one of the first places we go to - it's a family favourite. Great quality food, good prices and fast service. Just not that they don't provide napkins but have a little basin to wash your hands."
4,"Park Club at Shivaji Park is one of those places that quietly grows on you. Nestled in a charming neighborhood and just a short walk away from the sea, it has that peaceful, grounded energy that‚Äôs becoming rare in Mumbai. The salty breeze, the sound of waves in the background, and the greenery all around make it feel like a hidden escape right in the middle of the city.

It‚Äôs not a flashy club with fancy facilities, but that‚Äôs part of its charm. It‚Äôs simple, homely, and built for people who enjoy calm spaces. Whether you‚Äôre taking a stroll, catching a casual game, or simply relaxing after a long day, the vibe is slow and soothing. You‚Äôll find kids playing, older folks chatting on benches, and that familiar feeling of community that‚Äôs hard to find elsewhere.

Being so close to the sea adds a beautiful touch. On breezy evenings, with the sun dipping low and people unwinding, it truly feels like time slows down here. It‚Äôs not just a club, it‚Äôs a part of local life, a place where people come to breathe a little easier.

If you‚Äôre looking for luxury and modern frills, this might not be your place. But if you‚Äôre craving simplicity, fresh air, and a strong sense of belonging, Park Club checks all the right boxes."
5,Great ambience and great food but service needs to improve
4,"This place has barely changed over the years and we are certainly not complaining. Cheap Alcohol & Moderately priced food with a beautiful view of the sea & the BWSL.

You cant enter without a member though, however, they have begun hosting some interesting festivals such as the Wine & Fish festival held last month which lets the non-members drop by.

They also have a beautiful lawn for functions & a small hall.

Quite a few noted personalities, especially from the Marathi Film Industry, Can be spotted here
often."
3,Sea facing club with a great view of the Arabian sea with  Bandra Worli Sea Link road. Cool breeze.
4,"Park club canteen is good üëç
Hear A new football ‚öΩ and cricket turf open üëê in 30 September 2022
It is good four playing turf"
1,This is not for someone who loves food. This is mostly for people who drink and will have some side dishes. For 400Rs pomfret thali where fish are accessible 24*7. Still only 100-150 gms of small piece of fish. Solkadhi was also not upto mark. One gets better food on streets. It is not at all worth 400Rs. Go there if you are someone looking a place to drink. But don't consider it as a good tasting food/restaurant.
4,"Konkan Sanman offers authentic Konkani cuisine, specializing in seafood.
The flavors are average. They have a family room upstairs and a bar on the ground floor.

Located near Shivaji Mandir, the staff is good, and the ambiance has a cozy, cultural vibe.
Prices are reasonable.

We tried the Surmai Thali and Prawn Koliwada. Both were good.

Do try their thalis."
4,"I entered this place thinking it was a bar, but turns out this is more of a family restaurant with proper Konkani restaurant ambience and vibes. Hence, choosing this place for some drinks with your peers wouldn't be a very good option.
But besides that, the atmosphere and service was quite nice. I enjoyed my prawns koliwada along with some beers. (Again, not a good choice as there are families and kids around).
As this is a very popular restaurant, you have to wait for about 20-30 minutes even on weekdays.
The waiting staff was nice and helpful.
There can be improvements for hygiene and general cleanliness of the place, but it wasn't too bad.
My overall experience (only with the food and waiting staff, NOT the drinks) was quite pleasant."
1,"Very average food, bad service and over that found a fried hair in my lollipop worst experience ever I have been here before but a new waiter was so weird I had to wait for food for a long long time"
3,"Very average quality food pomfret fish fry was not at all fresh, there name suggest it‚Äôs kokan style food but fish curry,  it was far away from kokan or malvani, whatever curry served its taste was below average, service was good"
1,I went during 3pm and ordered rava dosa. Dosa was luke warm and barely cooked. What kind of restaurant cant serve hot food when there 3 occupied table. Disgrace. Even my friends masala dosa was barely warm. I regret wasting almost 200rs on bad food.
1,"üëâüèΩVery bad restaurant ......Very bad service by wetter and also as owner no tissue paper are present at table üëé

Scshewaam are very bad plz do not come in this restaurant very bad experience üëé"
5,"The food was very nice. We ordered rava masala dosa, onion tomato uttappam and paav bhaji. I liked the onion tomato uttappam the best and then the rava masala dosa. The paav bhaaji was decent. It was a decent restaurant and very budget friendly."
4,All time greatest experience m eat  misal paav too good n delicious üòã
3,This is all-veg udupi hotel serving mainly South Indian dishes. It also serve some North Indian items. Food quality is acceptable. The main plus point is this is bang opposite Matunga (WR) station and ideal for meeting people.
5,"A find because of a review posted on Instagram, and am I glad I visited!
The place and the food brings back memories from childhood. Desi Chinese at its best, with good service, big portions and everything very tasty. Loved it entirely, and will surely want to visit again."
1,"It was my 14th Wedding anniversary. My son was unwell, so we decided to order dinner at home. Waited anxiously for some yummy food. and all our joy, craving, and hunger died within first two bites. We had ordered several items and none were tasty. Veg sweet corn soup had no taste, my son had two bites and left it and slept. We had a few bites of chicken crispy and tasteless and only found chillies (more than 40 pcs found in first 6-8 bites which we three people had). Worst was we ordered pot firedrice and we received boiled rice which we eat with daal generally. Ordered from Zomato. Zomato has not done service recovery yet. Restaurant denied to entertain stating ""humara khaana aisa he banta hai."" Like really?? Spent 1500 and it was not even worth eating in free. Waste of time and money. Have never seen such tasteless food ever in life. :-(  been two days and we are still upset. Restauarant must get in touch with me personally and apologize and refund at least 80% of the price I paid. coz we did not eat the food and had to threw in the bin. The food was really awful."
5,"We went for dinner here, we ordered multiple dishes,the service was nice , the taste was quite good .
This place has waiting outside the restaurant I would recommend visiting early to avoid waiting in queue"
1,"Extremely Unpleasant Experience ‚Äì Very Disappointed with Lucky Dragon

My recent visit to Lucky Dragon was one of the most uncomfortable dining experiences I‚Äôve had in a long time. While we were quietly enjoying our meal, we noticed a few people waiting outside as the restaurant was full‚Äîwhich is understandable. However, what followed was completely unacceptable.

The owner of the restaurant began staring at us constantly, clearly trying to pressure us into vacating our table. He even started pointing at us and signaling the waitstaff to rush our service, making us feel extremely unwelcome and uncomfortable. It was as if we were being pushed out just to make room for the next group.

In the rush, the staff ended up serving us the wrong dish. We had ordered Chicken Singapore Rice and within 2-3 mins they served us something pathetic and wrong dish which we had not ordered ‚Äîclearly pre-prepared or made without any care. The taste was awful and nowhere near what we expected.

What disappointed me most was the owner‚Äôs attitude‚Äîhis behavior showed a complete lack of respect for paying customers. Instead of valuing our presence, we were treated like an inconvenience.

Dining out should be a pleasant experience, not one where you‚Äôre silently forced to eat in a hurry and leave. I will not be returning to Lucky Dragon, and I would not recommend it to anyone who expects decent service and basic respect as a customer."
4,The food was good. We ordered chicken manchow soup and chicken Manchurian noodles. It was very tasty and felt light. Also the quantity was sufficient for 2 people. Good amount of chicken pieces. The place has a very good ambience and is hygienic. The service is very quick and it is usually crowded during peak hours. Will definitely recommend this. The rates are also affordable. Overall value for money.
5,"One female staff at this joint was very helpful and friendly.. Had a pleasant experience and service. We bought roasted almond Icecream and anjeer ice cream, both were as good as any! Will visit again"
5,"Ice cream quality is good.
Staff is very helpful.

Location is pleasant seating is also cool.
After dinner it's a must.

They have 50% off on all scoops on every 22nd of the month, Except family pack boxes."
1,"Disappointed with the hygiene and service at Apsara Ice Cream. I found a small hair inside my ice cream while eating and immediately brought it to the cashier staff attention. Instead of addressing the issue, the staff dismissed my concern and claimed there was no hair, despite clearly seeing it. This is unacceptable for a food establishment. I expect better hygiene standards and customer service. Will think twice before visiting again."""
5,A great place to have ice cream they have a large variety of flavors and all of them have a very unique taste. I recently tried the Pani Puri flavor ice cream and it was mesmerizing üòç the seasonal fruit ice creams are the best here and you also get sugar free variety here I recommend everyone to visit here
3,Decent ice cream for a reasonable price. You do need some affordable treats every now and then. We tried the Brownie Blast. It may look just like Cookies n Cream but it tastes just like a brownie that was mixed with vanilla ice cream.
5,"One of the authentic irani cafes left around the dadar area. Two siblings, brother and sister, are carrying the legacy of this 92 year old restaurant. Their kheema pav brun maska bun mask chai omlette all the Iranian staples are legendary and still have the authentic taste, not changing to suit the taste of the times.
But the real show stealers are the shami kebabs and the irani guz, a sweet made from camel milk."
5,"Entering into this eatery , what engulfs you is pure nostalgia! It‚Äôs an epitome of what we call standing the testimony of time. I have always heard amazing reviews of this place and its food from my hubby and trust me It didn‚Äôt disappoint at all. Looking forward to many more visits"
4,"One of the few Parsi cafes which is still running strong in Mumbai.Established in the year  1934 and  has retained the old world charm till date.
The food is delicious, warm and fresh. The owner an old gentleman is fun to talk with over an irani chai and mawa cake.
Decor will make you reminisce of the old era , wooden chairs, chequered table clothes. With few antique porcelain tea wares in the shop."
4,"A quaint little Parsi eatery that has been around for a while and I have only just discovered it! Its a great place for some good scrumptious breakfast. They have the usual staples such as the bun maska and kheema pav and egg fry. I tried all these and they were absolutely delicious. They also serve some good chai. Their mawa cakes are really tasty and worth a try. They also have berry pulao and biryani on their menu though I haven't tried it yet, might do so the next time. If you are around do head over here!"
5,"Another old Irani restaurant showing it's character near Dadar TT. We used to visit with our college friends for a relaxed breakfast.
Always admired their chicken cutlets and Irani Shami Kabab. Prefer either Raspberry soda or Irani chai with bun maska. If it's cutlets for the snacks, go for chai and Bun / Brun maska as per your choice. If you are having kheema pav or omlette pav or berry berry pulav then prefer the raspberry soda or Shikanjibi....
All the dishes are with classic Irani touch and awesome in taste. Good place for good food. Irani chai is true to it's taste. Highly recommended Irani cafe üëçüèº‚òï"
4,"I visited the Gold Rush Hotel for dinner and had a pleasant experience. The hotel was clean, with a bright and welcoming ambiance. However, the menu card was in poor condition and could be improved.

The service was fast, the staff was courteous, and the food‚Äîpaneer butter masala with butter roti‚Äîwas delicious. Pricing was reasonable, neither too high nor too low. Overall, a good experience, though attention to small details like menu maintenance could enhance it further."
4,"Been here for dinner. This is a small restaurant with about 10 tables. Serves veg food. Ordered for alu mutter and chapati. Alu mutter was well made. Service was good. There is no washroom available but only a washbasin.
Rates are reasonable. Very close to the newly opened Dadar Metro. Restaurant is air conditioned."
1,"Today I visited Gold Rush restaurant in Dadar with  high expectations. However, the service was quite frustrating. After confirming the availability of a sandwich, I had to wait for a 35 minutes. Repeated inquiries to the waiter and manager they do not have clear answers, very disappointing. I hope the restaurant will prioritize its customers' time and provide timely service in the future"
5,"This is one of the best places to eat in Bombay! The food feels like home and so much like and even better than a lot of nice restaurants in the north!
You gotta go and try it out!
Ps. Promise you won't regret it all!!"
4,"Recently, I visited this restaurant with my family. We tried a variety of dishes, including Veg Crispy, Paneer Manchurian, Mysore Masala Dosa, Stuffed Paratha, and Veg Cheese Pizza. The food was delicious, considering the range of options we sampled. The restaurant is a bit small, but the ambiance was pleasant. The staff was prompt and contributed to a positive dining experience. Overall, it‚Äôs a great place to enjoy a meal."
3,"A maharashtrian delicacy restaurant with a decent sitting space. I tried solkadi, modak ,thalipeeth ,kothimbir wadi. Overall I felt it average taste wise. The rates are reasonable. You might face parking issues as no parking space available especially for four wheelers. Also there might be waiting post 8:30 pm onwards."
4,"Trupti Restaurant in Dadar offers authentic Maharashtrian flavors with a homely touch.

Veg Thali ‚Äì A balanced meal with fresh vegetables, dal, chapati, and rice, was good

Modak ‚Äì Soft, sweet dumplings filled with coconut and jaggery, perfectly steamed. Yumm and with optional ghee which adds aroma to it.

Thalipeeth ‚Äì A crispy, multigrain spiced pancake was tasty and fresh.

Kharwas ‚Äì A smooth, mildly sweet milk pudding, rich in texture was okay

Misal ‚Äì Spicy and tangy, topped with farsan and served with pav, bursting with flavor was good enough.

Kulfi ‚Äì was creamy, dense, and refreshing an ideal dessert.

With its quick service and authentic dishes, Trupti is a must-visit for Maharashtrian food lovers.

Except for the lesser quantity it is a good place to visit"
4,"On the very busy street opp Plaza cinema you will find this awesome pure vegetarian eatery, guess it's been operating since 1965. Be prepared to wait for your turn as the place is always crowded but it's worth the wait as the food won't disappoint you. It's an air-conditioned very neat and spacious place which serves authentic maharashtrian vegetarian cuisine with excellent quick service. It's on the main road so parking is an issue."
5,"The food here is super authentic. The best part is it's pure veg restaurant and have lots of options for maharashtrian cuisine. I tried their lunch thali with Puri. The portion size is very good and worth the price too. They served 2 sabzi, dal, rice, Puri, salad, pickle, sweet and papad. I found it very cost effective too. Their sweets are definitely to be tried! Absolutely gonna visit them again for their Maharashtrian delicacies."
5,"The food at Trupti is delicious, we had taken Veg thali and Solkadi and i would say that our stomach was full and even our taste buds were happy, it's so delicious

Please do visit this place for authentic experience and good food"
1,"This is not an authentic branch. They just have one sweet aflatoon available in such a big shop, that too mediocre and fake quality. This is a scam."
2,I tried thier aflalatun it was very sticky and other sweets not looked freshly made. Also the prices are pretty high compared with quality. How ever the ful khaja was something unique to try.
5,"‚ÄúAflatoon‚Äù Friend bought it from india as a gift.wow what a taste of pureness.Microwave it for 10 seconds and you are good to go.I wish to visit their one and only shop, as they claims that they don‚Äôt have any branch in the whole universe."
1,"I went to take aflatoon sweets, but they were not up to the mark. We didn't like the taste of that sweet as it should be always"
3,I bought an Aflatoon Mithai from this shop but did not get the original taste üòï
5,"One of the best HR Agencies in bhilwara, Hire Glocal, takes care of your hiring needs. In addition to describing their qualifications, applicants' profiles go into detail about their professional experiences, qualifications, motivation, pay rates, and other factors."
5,Absolutely LOVE their classic chicken Frankie!
5,"I personally feel Move N Pick is underrated. The frankies they serve are way tastier than the other competitors around.
The staff is humble, hygienic and quick to serve the order.
Since it is take a way kind a resto, ambience does not matter. The location is really very good."
3,"This place serves a variety of snacks like rolls, patties, burgers etc. Chicken lollipops and other fried items are also popular here. They do also have a dedicated counter for steamed momos which are average but their sauce is certainly better than other places. I find the food a but highly priced and the taste does nothing to justify the price. All in all it's an average snacks stall which could be a bit better."
4,Chicken roll was amazing cheese egg roll was just fine. The Frankie's were nice. On the whole a good experience.
5,"We had a great experience at Trupti Restaurant! Ordered Paneer Biryani, and it was absolutely delicious‚ÄîI was so engrossed in enjoying it that I forgot to click a picture! My friend tried their coffee, which was also amazing. The service was good, making the overall experience pleasant. Definitely a place worth visiting!

Would highly recommend!"
5,Good food and reasonably priced.. Very close to Sion hospital..
5,Best food. Prompt service. Friendly staff
1,"I recently visited this restaurant and unfortunately, my experience was not up to par. I ordered a tea and wada pav, but both items were disappointing. The wada pav wasn't fresh or hot enough, which affected its taste and texture. Similarly, the tea was not up to the mark, lacking the desired flavor and warmth. It's disheartening when basic items like these don't meet expectations. I hope the restaurant takes steps to improve the quality of its offerings for a better dining experience."
1,Extremely rude waiters. They give orders don't take meal orders. You are at their mercy after ordering. Manager can't control the waiters behaviours
5,"The Tibbs Frankie in Dadar is their first store in Mumbai, which opened in 1969. It has since become a beloved landmark in the city, known for its delicious frankies. The success of this first store paved the way for the expansion of the Tibbs Frankie chain across Mumbai and beyond.

Is it the healthiest food in the world? Probably not. But is it soul-satisfying? Absolutely. Tibbs Frankie Dadar is more than just a food stall. It's a reminder that sometimes, the most memorable meals are the ones you eat standing up, with a slightly greasy smile on your face, savouring every last bite."
5,Excellent place to have Frankie. Compare to other Tibbs centre we get good taste at this shop . Customer friendly staff. Sheekh kebab Frankie is my son favorite. Nicely prepared.
4,"I have been going to this outlet since 8-9 years and I may sound biased but they have the best Frankie compared to all other Tibb's outlets. It's a small shop, no seating and right in the begging of the street. One of the owners/cashiers is a genuinely nice man who values his customers. You'd think the after so many years the taste of their Frankies must have changed but it tastes almost identical. The chicken tikka Frankie is the one I usually end up ordering but they have a good menu for vegetarians as well. But most importantly, they do have seperate stoves and kitchenware for vegetarians so that you guys don't freak out"
4,"Losing a star only because it's no fun having food on a hot day. Tibbs has been a favourite of mine for ages. Barely make it to Shivaji park nowadays. But when I do, I always go for the mutton Frankie. TastyüëåüíØ"
2,"The famous Tibbs frankie has absolutely lost the quality and taste over the years. We had a chicken and paneer frankies, both were tasteless and loaded with oil!"
5,"A very clean and well maintained restaurant. One of the best I have been to in Mumbai.
Sunil our server welcomed us and gave us what one would term as special treatment.
He recommended good items, was not pushy and took into consideration that we didn't over order.
The food was great. Good shareable portions.
Nice choice of deserts too.
Yes I sure recommend this place in the Shivaji Park area."
5,"I would definitely recommend Tamnak Thai for tasty and authentic Thai food,the best part is they catered to my special need of non spicy yet tasty food , it was an overall pleasant experience dining here. The ambience ,staff ,food everything is excellent ."
5,Well it's a lovely place for a beautiful dinner I must say....each and everything that I have posted is just wowwwü´†üòçüòöand the drink cosmopolitan was just‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
5,Best food.authentic malwani food. Purely homemade taste. Interior is completely basic but feels like you are sitting in village room. Service is great. Less number of sittings plan accordingly to avoid waiting.
5,"Visited here for first time ... But I preferred only veg this time .. the ambience is perfect for Thai food. Quick service, perfect seatings, and the menu is good. Tried salad and noodles this time. Drinks may be a good option next time."
4,"Situated on the opp side of City light cinema and near Sardar cycle shop on the main road in Mahim - Dadar area this is a no frills authentic Gomantak seafood restaurant.
The place is quite modest with decent ambience. Seating is limited with AC and Non AC sections.
The food was really good and extremely reasonably priced. True value for money with fast service.
The thali is limited but worth the price that they are charging.
We tried the Surmai thali, Tisrya thali and chicken lollipop.
If you are looking for a seafood restaurant on a budget then this is the place."
4,We went there on wed night.It was crowded but we got a seat. The staff members were prompt and friendly.we enjoyed the food especially kadhi and vada ( looks like puri) they went well with all the curries. The overall menu was good and we enjoyed.The price was pocket friendly.
5,The food is good and offered at reasonable prices. The surmai thali was amazing.Their chiken crispy was too good and less oily. The staff is friendly. It's a must try for nonveg lovers.
5,"This is the second time we had dinner that this place.Well this place never fails us.Amazing amazing sea food.This place is all about food,don‚Äôt expect any fancy ambience or names of dishes.Extremely quick service,fresh catch,All the dishes taste differently unlike many other restaurants who have same gravy.We had ordered stuff bombil,Tisrya masala,mutton thali,kolambi Bhat,prawns Koliwada,prawns  crispy,Sol kadhi.Well Crown dish out of all this was tisrya masala,all the tisrya were filled and masala was extremely delicious.Stuff bimbo is another best dish to have here,Though Konami Bhat was bit upsetting.Sol kadhi was full of taste and fulfilling.Both the prawns dishes were crispy and flavouful.Portion size is also quite decent.one of the restaurant with genuine pricing for food.over all good conviction of food,taste,service and Charges."
5,Good old Konkani seafood. Low key inside - but don‚Äôt judge a book by its cover. When in Mumbai - cannot pass out on prawn koliwada.
4,"Most recommended food Korean rice and hot pot rice for this restaurant. Ambience, definitely outstanding along with quotes but it can be more impressive.
Food 4/5
Ambience 4/5"
4,"This is our go-to Chinese place. One of the best tasting Chinese joints (with an Indian touch) in Dadar-Matunga-Mahim. We had Tom kha, chicken manchow, and veg manchow soup, chicken crispy, chicken lollipop, apple chicken, crispy spinach chicken, paneer crispy, veg crispy, chilly garlic, garlic, and Schezwan noodles. Dine in or parcel we have ordered from here quite a number of times. Food is truly appetizing and hasn't yet disappointed us. When it comes to ambience, although they have managed to set a vibe and tone, with doodle art on the walls and the wall accents and basic chandeliers, the confined space offers extremely limited seating. The seating arrangement too is basic ‚Äì two to four person tables. Having said that the only drawbacks are tight space and no washroom facility."
5,Best place to have soups and Chinese dishes.. I liked thoukpa and zeda pepper soup
4,"Nice Ambiance, Ok Quantity, Good Service with Polite and We'll Behaved Staff ."
5,Awesome Food.. with good Quantity...If you wish to have a good quality and taste Chinese than you should visit this place. People who need a good salute and not good food than this place is not for you guys üòâ. Apple Chicken Lollipop and Teriyaki Rice with Gravy is my must have food whenever I come here. Any Rice with Gravy item is enough for 3 people. This will cost you around 800 rs for 3 people.
1,"We visited this restaurant and ordered Onion Uttapam, Pav Bhaji, and Masala Dosa. Honestly, the food was extremely bland ‚Äî it felt like there were no spices added at all. It was so flavorless that it felt like we were eating just for the sake of it. On top of that, the availability of food was very poor; most of the items listed on the menu were not even available. When we asked if they had anything like masala or something to add some flavor, they said they had nothing other then salt and pepper. Overall, very disappointing experience. They seriously need to work on the taste and improve the food options available."
1,"Horrible service. The waiters need to be taught how to behave with customers first. No basic etiquettes.
Secondly, served cold roti and when informed, the waiter is seen makes faces and muttering under the breath.
Really disappointed in the place."
4,"Nice And Clean Place
Hygienic Pure Veg Food
Very Very Reasonable Rates as compared to other Restaurants Around.
We ordered one Masala Dosa and Onion Cheese Uthapa both of Dishes were really delicious and ingredients were Fresh .

My god Coconut Chutney is Superbüëå

Still I think they need to work on sambhar
Over All we liked it.

Yes it's Recommended if you are near mahim or Hinduja Hospital"
5,"Good taste Veg food . Quality morning breakfast , fresh and tasty. Good ambience. Reasonable rates. Close to hinduja OPD building. Silent area. Not too crowded at least in morning .Well dressed staff. Hygenic ."
1,They give the cold dosa which was made in the morning. They don‚Äôt make fresh dose if you go in evening they give you leftovers.
5,"I love natural ice cream ,their flavours are amazing we tried tender coconut,lichee , pink guava tasted amazing somewhat salty and spicy , would not recommend malai flavour , rosted almonds was okish, coffee walnut was amazing .Overall nice experience"
5,My all time favourite icecream parlour. I've been trying their delicious new flavours everytime I visit yet their Tender coconut always steals my heart! It's always awesome to taste seasonal fruits in the form of icecreams. Loved it!!
2,Save youroney and don't dare buy a mango icecream. It's pathetic and waste of money. It is just sugar mango canned pulp frozen with milk. Really bad and too sweet.
3,"At one point, Natural Ice Cream used to be the fancy ice cream place that we would go to during special occasions. While the prices have become reasonable over the years, the quality has never wavered.

Natural is known for its fresh fruit flavoured ice creams however, I always opt for their Choco Bite flavour. The mild flavoured ice cream is churned with big and chunky chocolate chips.

I also prefer this outlet of Natural. The servers are swift and can handle even large crowds. You do have some seating but it's better to grab your ice cream and have it on the go."
5,I love how natural these ice cream tastes...it's my favorite place for having dessert...the icecream really fells fresh and refreshing
4,"This is near to  Solapur railway station
Choices are wide and awesome for beverage
Food here is spicy and tasty
Restroom wasn't good
Staff was friendly
Has quick service
Cost effective for the quality they provide
Parking space is not available for cars
Nice option for quick stop over and have some drinks with friends"
1,"This is Third Class experience. Lot & lot of chaos here,  you may feel Fish Market is better. Take lot of time to give service. You may have to tell to clean previous stuff from table twice.

I have seen this Bar where you don't get Chicken Lollipop Half.

Waiters don't give service the way you expect,  mean bare minimum requirements are not fulfilling.

My suggestion is not to go

Bad Bad Bad"
3,Shadey bar under matunga road bridge. The munchies over here are very tasty. Food is a bit spicy. Alcohol is also not that expensive. It is always crowded it has 2 sections Ac and the non Ac. Ac one has a good interior too.
5,"This is bar n restaurant serving both veg and non-veg food. Food quality is good. Fish95 is a signature dish here, one must try"
4,Cramped as it's quite popular
5,Breakfast very nice sp nali nihari and paya lacca prata
5,Tasty and too delicious dishes
4,This hotel is very nice
3,Tasty and cheap rates
5,Awesome taste
4,The famous spot in town for shwarma & roll lover's out there. You can get authentic shwarma here. tbh this the place where you should not look for the prices but for quality & quantity the offers . Worth every penny you spend.
1,"The worst shawarma i have ever had I can say the worst shawarma in entire MUMBAI , first of all it's expensive as hell i bought a normal chicken shawarma which cost 180 rupees and extra chicken cost 120 rupees . The mayo has no taste nor does the chicken  have any taste , a total waste of money . A kind suggestion please stop looting people or at least make it less worse."
4,Very tasty and good food. They have all quick bite but stomach fulfilling items. Great place to have morning breakfast or evening dinner replacement.  And it's different experience to have your plate and watch shivaji park liveliness.
3,I would say the food was Okayish. I have eaten better shawarmas for much lesser price. Staff behaviour didn‚Äôt seem appropriate and food was being prepared with bare hands therefore seemed unhygienic.
5,"Carter's Blue, Fort
It is great to go out with friends and find a restaurant with a nice ambience to make everyone feel more comfortable. Situated at Kala Ghoda near CST is the biggest location advantage. The staff was polite and courteous enough.

Starters:-

Chicken Lasooni Kebab is the must try starter which is served with pudhina chutney and mayonnaise. The perfectly grilled kebab along with the fried lasson topping are the perfect to give a start to your lunch/dinner.

Fish Tikka is also a good starter, it was properly cooked and softness of fish was also maintained.

Mocktails:-

Guava Mary mocktail had that perfect taste of the sweetness of guava as well as the spicyness of the the spices added into it.

Kiwi Cooler was the coolest drink ever had with that sour and sweet taste as well as was perfectly thick.

Main Course:-

Chicken Matka was full of spices, the gravy had a taste of rich muglai spices and the chicken was properly cooked which made the dish more delicious.

Rice and Biryani:-

Chicken Dum Biryani was very well cooked along with the right amount of spices going into it.

Dessert:-

Banoe Pie:- It was a sweet dish in which the bottom layer was of thick chocolate brownie and banana. Then there was a layer of smooth cream and in between them there is an small layer of banana with cream. The taste was good."
3,"Taste is great. Even if we have so many Cake shops in our area, we order cake only from Monginis. Verity of Cakes in different shapes. Prices are obviously high as they provide quality in product. Also available other breakfast stuff. Delivery is always on time but they don't delivered at your home."
4,"Good cake shop, well a reputed cake shop from year which serves us a good quality cake. But i can say prizes are a bit high, we can get a cheaper prize cakes with almost a same quality cake but overall is a good cake shop!!"
5,"Its Monginis, so as usual tasty pure veg cakes and pastries, and snacks such as puffs. Also they sell those tasty potato shells."
5,It is open for take-away. Loved their almond pastry and brownie and their chicken tikka roll.
5,Best monginis there is many varieties in cakes
4,"I have been to a few CCD branches, but this was my first time visiting CCD Dadar. It is located near Shivaji Park, and to my surprise, the place was so cool and calm, even when I visited around 6:30 PM. They have both indoor and outdoor seating available. This cafe gave me an old-school vibe, and reminded me of my college days when I used to visit CCD a lot.

I ordered a latte and a Green Apple Mojito, and the order was served within 20 minutes. The mojito was refreshing, and I absolutely loved it. However, I had mentioned while ordering that I wanted it without ice, but it was still served with ice. I informed the staff, but instead of replacing it, they left me to remove the ice myself, which was disappointing. On the other hand, the latte was good and served at the perfect temperature.

I chose to sit outside, as I love outdoor seating, and I had a peaceful experience. The outdoor area is well-ventilated with fans, so it was comfortable. The staff was cooperative, and the washrooms were clean and compact.

This is a great cafe where you can come with friends, family, or even solo. You can sit, read a book, or work in a relaxed and quiet environment. Overall, I really liked the vibe of the cafe, but I feel the service could be improved, especially when it comes to handling customer preferences more carefully.

If you are in Dadar, it's still worth visiting for a cozy cafe experience.

1,"Ordered salted caramel cappuchino paid for it and within 20 seconds asked to cancel that and change it for salted caramel frappe and the staff said it can't be canceled coz it's been billed , its pity being in 2025 ccd can't have a billing machine which can cancel and change the order, I never asked for refund all I wanted was to change. I would had ordered another item as well but it's ok, they lost a sale and a customer."
1,"Visited this CCD outlet, and it was a huge letdown. The chairs and tables were covered in dust, clearly not cleaned for a while. The staff seemed completely indifferent‚Äîno effort to maintain basic hygiene or customer service. The place looked neglected and unkempt. Definitely not the kind of atmosphere you'd expect from a coffee shop. Won't be visiting again!"
1,"I went to cafe on wed 7th may 2025 by 9:30 pm.
There was an employee who was taking order, he was so rude and talked in an impolite tone,was judging me while I was ordering and didn't explain me while I was asking my order options, yet I stayed polite with him.
I didn't ask him his name but after reading this review I know he would understand it. Strict action should be taken against him so that henceforth he behaves with all the customers in a proper manner."
2,I don't understand how they are still searving at such a prime location. Degrading day by day. Earlier it use to be a hot location at shivaji park.
4,"We visited Hotel Adarsh near Dadar Railway Station and had an excellent dining experience!
The masala dosa and misal we ordered were authentic and delicious, with perfect balance of flavors and spices.
The service was prompt and attentive, and the hygiene standards of the hotel were impressive.
The menu offers a good range of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, making it a great choice for diners with varying preferences.
Given its proximity to Dadar Railway Station, Hotel Adarsh is a convenient and reliable option for a tasty meal.
We would definitely recommend it to others!"
5,"I recently visited Adarsha restaurant, and I must say the experience was delightful. The ambiance was inviting and comfortable, setting the perfect tone for a pleasant meal.
I started with a dosa, which was wonderfully crispy and flavorful. For the main course, I opted for paneer and vegetables curry paired with roti. The taste was exceptional, with well-balanced spices and fresh ingredients. The portions were generous, and the prices were quite reasonable given the quality and service.
To finish, I ordered a piyush, a thick shake similar to lassi. It was rich, creamy, and packed with flavor, leaving a lasting impression on my taste buds. The staff were courteous and attentive, enhancing the overall dining experience."
3,"Discover authentic Marathi flavors at this charming eatery near Dadar West Railway Station!

Nestled straight from Suvidha Shop, this compact restaurant packs a big punch when it comes to taste. I devoured the thali and tea, and here's the lowdown:

- Puri: hot and puffy perfection
- Dal: absolutely superb
- Chana curry sabji: mouthwatering delight
- Raita: creamy and divine

The thali also included plain rice, potato sabji, chas, pickle, and papad. The ambience is pleasant and the service is prompt. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and would definitely recommend this place for a taste of traditional Marathi food."
4,"Well since my childhood we have come here. So no doubts about the the food.
We had Batata Vada, Bhajni Thalipith, Kothimbir Wadi and Kokam Sarbat.
Batata Vada was awesome. Bhajni Thalipith with Loni truely heaven. Kothimbir Wadi was nice too.

And to my suprise, they started Nonveg also from last 1 year maybe."
5,"Had a great experience at Adarsh Hotel near Dadar Railway Station. The ambience is really pleasant‚Äîclean, comfortable, and welcoming. The staff were very courteous and helpful throughout. Service was quick and efficient, making the whole visit smooth and enjoyable.

I tried the Paneer Tikka Masala along with Butter Roti and Butter Garlic Naan, and the food was absolutely delicious. The paneer was soft and flavorful, and the naan was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of garlic and butter.

Even though the menu has limited options, it covers everything you'd need to satisfy your hunger. Simple, tasty, and satisfying‚Äîdefinitely worth a visit if you're in the area!"
3,"A decent pure veg place to have your meal, if visiting this area. Expect wait time on weekends. The food is average, but so are the prices. The service can be improved. Because of the renovation, it has new fine dine like furniture but the servers behave the same old. It gets noisy with spoon sorting, plate banging for no clear reason. Overall vibe is heavy and old school."
4,Food is good and great but only on weekdays or when there is less crowd. When there is more crowd there is some compromise on quality on weekends. Else would rate it a full 5 star.  But otherwise it's the best place for even north indian food.
1,Their hospitality is not good. The waiters don't have a look on customers they just roam around. I visited their 3 times but still it was same poor experience there. The food is costly with basic taste of food. I didn't like it the hospitality and ain't gonna visit there again. They take very much time to serve food after order given.
3,"Everything about this restaurant is good the food the ambience the seating can be a little more uncomfortable considering how the structure of the restaurant is but it‚Äôs manageable. The only thing which needs to be improved is the service.
We ordered one Uthappa and idli vada and watermelon juice
The juice came first after 10 mins of placing the order
More 10 mins later came the other two dishes
Food tasted amazing was hot and everything good but waiting 20 mins to get a normal vada served doesn‚Äôt makes sense.
For a quick bite it can be a little odd place but if you got plenty time on your hands do give it a try."
4,"I visited 1st time after the renovation
Place was really good, cozy, good ambiance.
No waiting at 8 pm after that it started getting crowded

Food had served in a good time
Presentation was also goodüòä

Payment can be done by cash or card/ gpay
Reservations are available
Prize is also decent.

Parking is not available near by.

Food :
Masala papad: was really crunchy and good with all the veggies
Margherita pizza: üòÖ it was soooo cheesy and yummy ü§§
Harabhara kabab:( forgot to take pic) it was really really worth all my money. So so yummy
Highly recommended ‚úåÔ∏è"
4,Great food at subsidized rates for students. Very hygienic. Pure Veg. Gravy Manchurian is a must try.
2,Okay place . Seating arrangement is not great and the food quality is ok. No choice for the students though they serve a variety of dishes.
4,Food is good as per the rates. Only vegetarian options are available.
5,Quality of food is 7/10
5,Good it is.
4,"Maharashtrian vegetarian restaurant, with only AC section for dining. Expect at least 15-30 min waiting time before being seated. Food is good and service is fast, courteous and professional. Speciality desserts are not so special. They are trying to take care of hygiene and cleanliness."
4,"This was my second visit to the establishment, this time post-lunch following a business meeting held at the venue. We sampled a range of traditional fare including vada pav, aloo wadi, and poori bhaji ‚Äî all of which were well-prepared and flavorful. The highlight, however, was the modak, both regular and mango varieties, which stood out for their taste and freshness.

To conclude the meal, we ordered tea, which unfortunately did not meet the same standard as the rest of the offerings. The total bill came to a little over 600 for two, which felt reasonable given the quality and variety.

The ambiance has been notably improved with the recent renovation of the first floor ‚Äî the space now feels more refined and inviting. Conveniently located diagonally opposite Sena Bhavan, it‚Äôs a spot worth visiting for those in the area.

The only drawback is the lack of parking. Securing a spot nearby can be a genuine challenge. Introducing valet parking, even on a paid basis, could significantly enhance the overall guest experience.

Overall, a satisfying experience and a place I would consider revisiting."
4,"Ambience of the place is very good, The staff is friendly and gives you a warm welcome when you enter the hotel. I tired their misal pav and bata vada along with the tea, The taste of the misal has country side flaours however I would rate it above average also the quanity is small, Farsan taste is not that great, Bata vada has light taste of ginger but its more like bonda in south served with coconut chutney and lasun dry chutney, Tea nothing but milk with missing tea powder. However please vist for the ambience and staff courtousy and they have many other items which you can explore"
5,"Aaswad is an amazing spot that leaves a lasting impression. From the moment you enter, they take excellent care of you, escorting you to your seat based on your preference. The menu and the overall vibe are uniquely designed to reflect authentic Marathi culture.

The misal pav here is an absolute must-try‚Äîarguably one of the best I‚Äôve ever had! I also tried the modak, which was nice but could use some improvement to reach its full potential. On a personal note, I really appreciated that everyone was speaking in Marathi; it added a warm, cultural touch to the experience.

Highly recommended for anyone looking to enjoy authentic Marathi flavors and hospitality!"
3,"I recently visited Asswad Uphaar Gruh and was thoroughly impressed with the ambiance, the staff were courteous and attentive. The food was delicious, with a wide variety of options to suit every taste. The presentation was also impressive, making each dish a treat for the eyes as well as the palate."
4,"Good variety of idli's are served hot. Post pandemic they serve sambar and rasam in small plastic cups and staff is generous to offer extra chutney or sambar multiple times.
We went att exact 7 am so all idli varieties were super fresh and hot. We tasted vegetable idli, mysore rava idli, idliyappam (served with coconut milk and chutney) and super super tasty Kanchipuram idli. Rasam was watery, not so tasty but sambar was very good in taste. Ideal joint for hopping in for quick bite of idli of your choice and go."
5,"They have multiple varieties of idlis available which is a plus. I tried the cucumber idli which was tad bit sweet than my liking but my friend loved it, you could taste the cucumber and there was no compromise on taste, they also serve idli with red chutney and green chutney, ghee and podi is also available. I also tried ukdicha modak which was excellent. The seating area is small so a takeaway is a good option"
4,"A small place with some amazing varieties of Idili. You can experience authentic South Indian idli style here.

Cons: They don‚Äôt have enough seating area. So it‚Äôs better to take parcel."
3,"The Idly hotel is CLOSED.
Only sweets /snacks & Tea /coffee is available.
Sweets are really good, Especially Jahangir,Pooran poli ,are excellent.
Appe midi pickles is very good."
2,"This place is one of the oldest South Indian food chains in Matunga. I picked up Rava idli, Khote idli, pan poli each costing Rs. 45/-

They serve only one piece of idli for Rs. 45/- which I found a little overpriced. Moreover sambar was horrible. It had no taste, no spices and a watery consistency. Coconut chutney was okayish but a bit watery. The idlis were very crumby, looked like it was more like a rava idli wrapped in jackfruit leaf and kevda leaf.

There are other outlets in Matunga serving authentic south indian food - one must try other outlets."
5,"Good chat items üëç but I'm a guy from chennai who was expecting chat items from chennai also, but many items were missing. Altogether chat items were excellent üëè üëå üëç"
1,"Food is average. Hyginity is just a Gimmick.
As a hardcore mumbaikar i know 20+ chaaat places who sells Tastier chaat at less prices.
Place is expensive chaat starts from 60rs. But there is not a single thing which justifies the price.
Rude Workers dont use gloves,face mask,hair masks. Used spoons are collected near Dustbin in open bucket filled with water."
5,"Well this is a popular local joint serving delicious street food. I like all the Chaat served here. We had some pain Puri and Bhel Puri.

The Chaat was delicious. Also, their sandwiches are worth a try. They also have this unique sev Puri sandwich which is a fusion of sev Puri and sandwich."
5,"I visited this famous chaat shop in matunga. Ordered and tasted best masala puri. Located near the brink of matunga station, chocolate sandwich, chocolate masala puri sandwich, sukha bhel and Oreo milkshake are popular here. A must visit chaat corner of matunga."
5,"Mumbai has blessed with so many places where you get best chat food. Each area of Mumbai you will find one of the most popular chat food wala. So when it comes to matunga, gupta chat centre is really famous.

Sev puri sandwich, cheese bhel puri are few of the must try dishes of them."
4,"Tucked next to a small hotel, Terttulia is a charming spot with classic decor and a lovely indoor-outdoor setting. It has a cozy yet stylish vibe, making it feel like the perfect place for a relaxed meal. Surprisingly, it was quite empty when we visited for lunch on a public holiday‚Äînot sure why, but it made for a peaceful dining experience.

Now, onto the food‚Äîabsolutely excellent! Every dish we tried was well-prepared and flavorful. The real standout? The dessert with the chocolate dip‚Äîrich, indulgent, and the perfect way to end the meal.

Drinks were great too! The menu offers a good mix of options, from refreshing mocktails to well-crafted cocktails.

Overall, a hidden gem with great food and ambiance. Hope it gets more love because it truly deserves it!"
5,It‚Äôs my favourite restaurant and their thin crust pizza is my favourite but my friend thought of given their mushroom risotto and chicken skewers a chance and it was spot on. The watermelon juice along with it was very refreshing as well. They have lovely ambience and service is good.
5,"What a stroke of luck - discovered by chance. An insider tip for all night owls. Great ambience, delicious food and a live DJ. What more could you want? There's everything from soups, salads and main courses to small tapas to share. So there's something for everyone here. But even if you just want a drink, this is definitely the place for you. There is a large selection of drinks - both alcoholic and non-alcoholic.
The service is attentive and quick, even the boss himself came and enquired whether you were satisfied with the service.
It's also a great place to celebrate with friends as a group. But make sure you book in advance. The restaurant is not very large and therefore the number of seats is limited.
Stop by and enjoy the nightlife of Mumbai."
2,Extremely disappointing. Ordered through Zomato. Food delivery has items missing. Food quantity very less for the value charged and taste also not good. Shocking that such a big cheat and people have given reviews of 4.5!!!! The Grilled chicken has only 5-6 small piece of chicken grilled vegetables were mentioned but nothing came. The quantity of gunpowder potatoes was shocking at Rs 415
5,"Had a lovely time here ‚Ä¶it was our first visit ‚Ä¶
I especially loved how clean the washroom is and fragrant ‚Ä¶a rare site at most places
Food suggested by the staff was bang on ‚Ä¶.
We cud use a little increase in portion size maybe for the prices quoted but nonetheless an excellent place to eat drink and have a good time ‚Ä¶keep up the good work ‚Ä¶hope to visit soon again soon"
4,"An iconic South Indian cuisine restaurant in the iconic Matunga east neighbourhood of Mumbai. Everything, I repeat, every damn food item here is par excellence.

Things eaten: Paniyaram, Rassam, Medu Vada, Kanchipuram idli, appam with coconut stew, mysore onion dosa, cheese pav bhaji, pineapple sheera AND filter coffee.

Verdict: The Medu vada is truly one of the best I have ever had. It is so soft yet crispy at the same time. The coconut chutney and Tamilian sambar is unparalleled. Appam with coconut stew is amazing as well. Especially the stew was so delicious. Mysore onion dosa feels rich in flavour and is prepared in pure ghee. Kanchipuram idli was a decent one and a bit sour. Paniyaram was a one-of-a-kind and is a must try. Cheese pav bhaji was not bad but failed to meet the bar raised by other food items. For desserts, you have to have the pineapple sheera and you can thank me later. A south indian cuisines is incomplete with the iconic filter coffee and the coffee here will not disappoint you. The service is super quick and they serve you unlimited Sambar and Chutney

This restaurant was hitting home-runs after home-runs and I was about to give this place the coveted 5-star rating when they committed a hygienic blunder. I found a small hair in their Pav. Hygiene is as important as the taste and had they not compromised on the hygiene, my search for the 5-starred restaurant would have ended today. But alas the search continues!!"
4,"There was huge queue for Ramashray as usual so decided to visit Arya Bhavan. It's now located on the ground floor of an under construction building.
And it's air-conditioned.. Now to the food tried their Medu Wada which freshly made and crispy, Paniyaram were fluffy and properly stuffed, Rava Dosa was like a waffer thin and crispy.. And how can one not have their filter coffee.. It was perfect to start and end my breakfast.. Staff is friendly and polite.. 3 item and 3 coffee costed 600 bucks.. Surely coming back to try their other food items."
5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Arya Bhavan, and I must say, it was an unforgettable experience! This South Indian restaurant is a hidden gem, serving up authentic, mouth-watering dishes."
5,"If you‚Äôre craving authentic South Indian flavors, this place should be on your list. We visited recently and were thoroughly impressed by the quality of the food and the overall experience.

We started with the Odi Idli, which was generously filled with ghee. It was a delight for anyone who enjoys the rich flavor of ghee, and we highly recommend trying it. The Dosa was another highlight‚Äîit was perfectly crispy, just the way a good dosa should be. The star of the meal, however, was the Oni No Tappa, which was simply the best I‚Äôve ever tasted‚Äîfull of flavors and cooked to perfection.

On the other hand, the Rava Dosa didn‚Äôt quite hit the mark. It was decent but didn‚Äôt stand out compared to the other dishes.

The ambience was pleasant, with a comfortable sitting space for diners. Parking can be tricky, especially during peak hours, but we were lucky to find a spot. However, it‚Äôs worth noting that parking could be a concern if the place gets crowded.

Overall, this restaurant delivers on its promise of authentic South Indian cuisine, and we‚Äôll definitely be back for more!"
5,"Currently under renovation, best food ,at par with ramashraya, rava dosa and bhramnin idli is outstanding , don't miss rasam wada"
1,"We went in to celebrate birthday, but were totally disappointed by the food. Both the fish were deep fried. The curry taste was bland . We ordered stuffed pomfret and surmai fry thali. Everything was off. The stuffed pomfret didn't have coriander cutney inside
, it had red chutney didnt have the authentic stuffed pomfret taste. the coating outside was too oilly and lack taste . Surmai was stale. Bhakri was small compared to other restaurants, little burnt. Rice quantity was more than the curry. Curry wasnt sufficient enough. Coconut in the Solkadhi was over (khomat). Solkadhi had a tadka on it. Which added unnecessary oil to it. Totally wasted our money. When you pay ‚Çπ500+ on thali you expect it to me good. Never ever going again."
4,"We had crab lolipop, chicken masala thali and butter chicken. It was tasty. Chicken gravy from thali was tasty. Restaurant was almost full at 3.30 pm we were already late. N at around 4 pm it was closed. We were last to move out of the restaurant."
1,"I ordered surmai thali and prawns fry and was not at all satisfied by the taste, quality and quantity too. Surmai was frozen which they didn‚Äôt informed at the time I ordered . Surmai wasnt tasty prawns were ok but quantity was not satisfying. The staff and owner wasnt even bothered about the complaints. I felt we paid for nothing prices are too high and food is ridiculous. We went in for a good maharashtrian taste but bad experience"
5,"Hello friends,

I visited this hotel in weekend with my wife. we both confused what we order, so asked hotel staff named as Suryakant. He suggest a plate Gomantak Special Machhi Thali. So we ordered that Thali Special Machhi Thali which contain three types of machhi curry's - 1) Surmai Curry 2) Prawns Curry 3) Khekda Curry
one fry item i.e. Surmai/Pomfret.
one prawns Masala Rice
Two Bhakari
Two Kokam Kadi

The taste was too yummy. one of best Thali I have ever eat. Usually I don't prefer Thali, but this thali was too yummy. I cant say anything. I am too surprise about the taste.
Special Thank you for the man who Suggest the this Thali. - The Is SURYAKANT. Really Thanks Surya Bhai."
1,"I visited here yesterday with my friends.
We all want to have fish food so we decided to go here. after taking the seat in the Ac section. there was no one to give us a menu. We waited for about 10 minutes to get the menu, after waiting for more than 15 minutes the order taker came and took the order. We ordered a Prawn masala prawn fry Pomfret fry thali, surmai thali, chicken kadai, chapati, bhakri, and prawn pulav. after Placing the order we received the food in 20 minutes. but the taste of the food was worst, the gravy we received in both the thali was the same no taste at all. the pomfret and surmai were not fresh. even wada, Prawn pulav okay but solkadi was too watery. only the prawn fry and Prawn masala was the best part. Rest all the food was a waste of money. The quality and quantity was to less. It was a really bad experience."
4,"Small Palace has a cute ambiance and the service is good. The food tastes great, but the bun maska is absolutely superb and the tea is fantastic. The egg bhurji is very tasty, and the quantity is generous. There is usually a queue, so you might have to wait a bit. It's a very simple, no-frills place‚Äîno hanky-panky, just good food."
5,"Food is awesome.....
Service is good and prompt....
Atmosphere & Ambience is authentic..,.it will make give you feel of 70s & 80s
Very small place, but if you are foody and love to eat good non veg  food then this the place to visit. Road side parking available at your own risk. No wheelchair access. No washrooms. Not kids friendly.
Rest is all good...."
4,"""Delicious Kepsa at Lights of Bharat!""
I tried the Kepsa at Lights of Bharat, and it was absolutely delicious! The food quality here is excellent, and the menu offers a nice mix of Chinese and other cuisines. Despite being a small restaurant, the food was fresh and flavorful.

The atmosphere was okay, but one drawback is that they only accept cash‚Äîno credit cards or Google Pay. So, make sure to carry cash if you're planning to visit.

Overall, it was a good experience, and I would love to visit again for the tasty food!"
4,"If you're in Dadar and haven't visited Light of Bharat, you're missing out on a true Irani-Parsi gem! This no-frills, old-school caf√© is all about flavor, tradition, and heart.

The Mutton Keema Double Decker, Berry Pulao, and Mutton Bheja Fry are simply unbeatable. Their Bun Maska, Salli Chicken, and strong Irani Chai in tall glasses make for the perfect breakfast or late lunch combo. And don't forget the Bread Pudding with Egg ‚Äì a rare find and an absolute delight.

The vibe is nostalgic ‚Äì from the handwritten menu to the retro interiors. Prices are super reasonable, and the service is quick. Just a heads-up: they accept only cash, so come prepared.

Highly recommend this spot for anyone craving authentic Irani-Parsi fare. Whether you're a local or just exploring Mumbai, this place deserves a visit."
5,Retro vibes the vine is important ambience is way good feels like ur in 90s clean . Owner with a best smile staff really quick sometimes u need to be patience for good taste and things . Loved the taste and there special ingredients which brings the food extra taste . U am in love of this Irani cafe I just had first time experience here but trust me o will visit again and again . U will try there all menu . This time  I had there chicken kheema and tawa pav kheema is around 180 and pav is separate . One portion is enough for one person but u can share in two if ur going to have another dish so we ordered one more dish that was egg biryani the quantity is for two person u will really love it it comes in good portion that two person can have it half plate is for 150 and full is for 230 . I really loved . Will recommend this place for ur snacks and lunch no regret and pocket friendly
1,"I placed an order of cheesy fries and BK veggie burger online. And when I got the delivery , iceberg lettuce in the burger was literally spoilt.. and burger bun was totally stale , dry and crumbling...
In this competitive world they are putting the food quality at stake... This is really very pathetic üò°"
5,"Burger King Review
Burger King is a well-known fast-food chain famous for its flame-grilled burgers, especially the Whopper. The brand stands out for its smoky, char-grilled flavor, which sets it apart from competitors.
Food Quality & Taste
The burgers are juicy and flavorful, with a signature char-grilled taste. The Whopper is the highlight, with fresh lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and mayonnaise adding a great balance of flavors. The chicken options, like the Crispy Chicken Sandwich, are decent, but some menu items can feel greasy. The fries are average‚Äîcrispy but not as iconic as some competitors.
Service & Speed
Service quality depends on location. Some outlets provide quick and efficient service, while others may have slower wait times. Drive-thru service can be inconsistent, with occasional order mix-ups.
Ambience & Cleanliness
The restaurant interiors are usually clean but basic. Some locations have modernized seating areas, while others feel outdated. Cleanliness varies from place to place, with high-traffic locations sometimes struggling to maintain hygiene.
Friendly staff (sepcialy pravin was very friendly nicr Manager
Burger King is reasonably priced, often running promotions and deals that make meals affordable. The value menu offers decent options, though prices have been rising in recent years.
Burger King is a solid fast-food choice if you enjoy flame-grilled burgers. It may not always have the best service or consistency, but when done right, it delivers a satisfying meal."
1,I went there because I thought burger kind food quality is good but in reality when I taste food quality is very poor and pathetic even there is no taste of burger it's very lite and French fries not cook properly it's taste like Raw fries. I am attaching bill as well it's someone hard earn money and really not worth for expenses in burger king. Even staff is not ready to agree they continously said to me sir our food is good. They are little bit Arogant. Please refund my money and I recommend to people don't go such place where management is not good.
5,Today we celebrate our son birthday at Burger King the best and joyful experience I really enjoyed a lot I really like to celebrate it again the stafff was very friendly and good overall great experience
1,"Today, I visited the Burger King in Dadar East. I placed an order through the app and requested a glass of water. The person at the counter said there was no water available and that I would have to buy a bottle of Bisleri. Just a few seconds later, another customer came in and asked to refill their empty bottle, and another staff member immediately refilled it. This kind of partiality is unacceptable. WORST experience! I will never visit here again, and I will also ensure that none of my friends or family come here. I will also advise my company not to place bulk orders here for any office function here after.Please check the staff image who has denied for the water."
3,Ok. Not bad for a quick snack. Think its pure veg.

5,"The place is mostly crowded and congested.
We tried their puneri misal pav. The taste was good and authentic. The Staff is quick. Recommended or goto place for Maharashtrian snacks."
4,Great place to have breakfast. Try Rajgira Puri- Batata bhaji. Mithai items are also available. A bit expensive for breakfast...
5,"Their solkadi is a must try. It is on the strong and tangy side but the flavor is very authentic. Kokam sarbat was a bit too sweet for my taste.

I tried other items such as farali pattice and kothimbir vadi which were definitely unique, and the flavored curd they are served with is unique as well. I liked them and would recommend trying.

The location is very conveniently accessible from Dadar station, but do not bring your vehicle here as there is no parking. Food is served fast but the waiters are a little slow to take orders and not the most polite. Prices are reasonable."
5,"I tried the Piyush from Panshikar & Co today, and it was absolutely delightful! The drink had the perfect balance of sweetness and richness, with a smooth, creamy texture that made it incredibly refreshing. It‚Äôs a great option for anyone looking to try something unique and traditional. Served chilled, it was a perfect way to cool off. Highly recommend giving it a try if you're visiting Panshikar!"
5,"Hi non maharashtrians, if ever you want to try Maharastrian cuisine, authentic maharastrian cuisine, then this is the place.

The standout dish for us was the Zunka and Jowar Bhakari. The Zunka was perfectly spiced that paired beautifully with the soft Jowar Bhakari. It‚Äôs the kind of comfort food that makes you feel at home, even if you‚Äôre miles away.

Another highlight of our meal was the Modak and the Kharvas. 10/10!! Overall impressed with the food but also the attentive service. Whether you‚Äôre a fan of Maharashtrian cuisine or looking to try it for the first time, this restaurant should definitely be on your list."
4,"Hands down, some of the most delicious food I've eaten lately that are talipot, kothimbir vada and dal khichadi must try."
1,Very Costliest food. Quality is not also not good üö´. We asked pithale bhakari waiter brought zunka bhakari. And they are serving only 1 bhakari which is thinner than regular chapati. Also ordered dal khichdi which tastes like simple dal and rice.
5,"Very nice restaurant to visit with family. Thalis feom different regions of Maharashtra are avaialble and food is very tasty.
The menu is very nice ala carte is also available.
We ordered special thali, batata vada, pudyanche vade and thalipeeth."
5,"I had a great experience at this maharashtraian food restaurant in Dadar Mumbai. The place was cozy and clean, and the staff was friendly and attentive. The highlight of the meal was the pithala bhakri, a traditional dish of gram flour curry and flatbread.

The pithala was spicy and flavorful, and the bhakri was soft and flaky.

Also tried veg biriani which was ok in taste but good in qty.

The portion was generous and satisfying, the price was little high.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves maharashtraian cuisine or wants to try something new."
5,"Breakfast???
Madras cafe is the best option....you get the authentic taste of south indian food.
They have system of Sharing tables
You should try their Kaapi (coffee)
Food no doubt was  very good ü©∑"
5,"Best üëå

We had an amazing experience at this restaurant! We tried the Ghee Podi Idli, Rasam Vada, and Ghee Mysore Masala Dosa, and everything was absolutely delicious. The flavors were rich, the textures were perfect, and the generous use of ghee made every bite heavenly.

The pricing is also very reasonable, making it a great spot for a fulfilling South Indian meal. However, they don‚Äôt provide tissues, so it's better to carry a handkerchief.

Overall, highly recommended for anyone who loves authentic South Indian food!"
5,"Cafe Madras is one of the oldest and most well known restaurants for South Indian snacks and mini- meals. The taste and quality have stood the test of time. I have been a regular visitor for many years and recently had the opportunity to visit it after nearly a decade.
I went there in the evening for ' tiffin ' and after a short wait was ushered in. I had Idli, Wada with Sambar, Appam with Stew and Curd rice, accompanied by Rasam and followed by Filter coffee. The food was superb as usual: fresh, tasty, right degree of flavour and spice, with optimum quantity per dish. The cost for two was only Rs. 583/- or so, making it probably the highest value for money meal that I have had in recent years.
The magic of the place is intact! When I came out, there was a big queue of people waiting to go in.
Overall, it was a great and nostalgic experience."
5,"Authentic south Indian snack. Taste is quite authentic. All of the items are wonderful. You should try Tuppa Podi. The owner and staff are really polite and attentive. If you arrive on the weekend, you will need to wait 30 to 60 minutes for your turn. All things are reasonably priced."
4,"Best place to try south indian tiffins.
ordered dosa, vada, Idli butter podi and coffee
Tiffins are good
Idli butter podi is a must try.
coffee is ok.
Chutneys and sambar served with tiffins are good
place is busy and service is fast.
This place is closed on monday."
5,"I tried their Mutton Biryani (as suggested by ChatGPT!) and was pleasantly surprised by its taste and texture. The biryani was flavourful but not with an overwhelming taste, it was just the right amount of happiness. I will definitely revisit Delhi Darbar on my next visit to Delhi."
5,"I was told that places served one of the best Biryanis in Mumbai. It did not disappoint. Great flavours, great size. All in all just great. Highly recommend for a lunch or easy dinner."
5,"A must if you are visiting Mumbai.  No prior booking was required on the occasions visited. Upstairs and downstairs seating options. Extensive menu options üòã to cater for all tastes.
The briyani is legendary, wash it down with some falooda. Don't skip dessert üòã Service is quick and friendly.  The waiters know the menu very well, ask for guidance on menu options. Definitely recommend üëå"
4,"Delhi Darbar in Colaba is a well-known name, and for good reason. The restaurant offers a classic Mughlai dining experience with rich flavors, courteous service, and a warm ambiance. From the moment you walk in, you're greeted with friendly staff and efficient service. The interiors are clean, comfortable, and carry that traditional old Bombay charm, making it an inviting place for both locals and tourists.

The food truly lives up to its reputation. Dishes like their **Butter Chicken**, **Mutton Rogan Josh**, and **Biryani** are packed with authentic North Indian flavors‚Äîaromatic, perfectly spiced, and cooked with care. The naan and kebabs are excellent accompaniments and showcase the quality of their tandoor work. Service is quick even during busy hours, which enhances the overall experience.

However, there are two important downsides to keep in mind. First, **there is no dedicated parking**, which can be a real inconvenience, especially in a crowded area like Colaba. You'll most likely need to park a fair distance away or rely on a taxi or ride-share. Second, **the prices are quite high for the portion sizes offered**. While the quality is excellent, the quantity doesn‚Äôt always justify the cost, especially for those dining in groups or families.

Despite these drawbacks, Delhi Darbar remains a must-visit if you're craving authentic Mughlai food in South Mumbai. Just plan your transport ahead and be prepared for a premium pricing experience. Great for occasional indulgence, especially if you're after rich, flavorful Indian cuisine."
3,"Hi friends
The hotel ambience is very good. Washroom is available. Food quantity is very  low and quality is also not satisfie. I ordered Dehli Darbar special plater but very üòû because quantity is very low not enough for 2person and price is 650/ Rs. and taste is not good. Service is not fast."
5,"I I love the service given by the staff, food and atmosphere. I love to celebrate my birthday all alone every year in this place. I had an absolutely delightful experience at Sea Lounge, The Taj Mahal Palace. Highly recommend it for anyone looking to experience timeless luxury with genuine hospitality. All alone or with your family you would love the vibe and foods."
5,"Classic and ethereal experience. The buffet was lip smacking, vast and severely indulgent. The view was the icing on the cake. Abhinav from their staff recommended a foamy thick cold coffee and it was delicious. They were even kind enough to parcel a cold coffee for me. Smiling, sweet servers and an atmosphere that took you back in time. It was a hearty and heartening experience."
2,"My first visit to the iconic Taj Mahal Palace was meant to be a special celebration‚Äîa high tea at Sea Lounge to mark my friend‚Äôs birthday. However, the experience left much to be desired.

Upon arrival, we were informed that opting for the buffet was mandatory. While we obliged, I politely inquired if they could do something special for my friend‚Äôs birthday, only to be met with a flat refusal.

Initially seated away from the picturesque windows, we were later moved to a better spot, which was a thoughtful gesture. The buffet, though limited for vegetarians, was adequate, and the chaat platter they served was quite decent. Yet, when we requested an additional plate, it never arrived. Disappointingly, we noticed that our table received considerably less attention from the staff compared to others around us.

To our surprise, we saw two other tables celebrating birthdays. When I raised the matter again with the staff, I was told that prior notice of at least 30 minutes was required for a cake to be arranged. This lack of communication and effort felt underwhelming‚Äîespecially considering the high standards one associates with the Taj. Even modest eateries make an effort to create a warm and memorable experience for birthday celebrations.

Unfortunately, this visit fell short of expectations. What was meant to be a joyful and memorable first experience turned into an ordinary one, lacking the charm and attentiveness one hopes for in such a renowned establishment."
5,"Last day in Mumbai we decided to walk around the south parts, and have afternoon tea at the Taj, which we booked in advance, with a window view of India gate. The initial buffet food was outstanding and then more elements brought to our table. The service was truly exceptional, and the masala tea great. Had the best dessert cake also with my tea. Nothing was not much when I asked for a special sandwich more that accommodating"
5,"It was my first experience and I must say , it's totally worth the time and money. Aesthetic vibes, soothing music, perfect services and the picture perfect view to enjoy a perfect drink and food. üíØ Recommended for ones who want to enjoy a perfect cosy dinner date."

4>their chicken seekh kebabs are tasty but are priced at 360 rupees for just 3 pieces

Must try:
Chicken bhuna with rumali roti
And chicken seekh kebabs"
4,"Visited Bade Miyan restaurant behind the Taj‚Äîan old, no-frills place with a simple setup. Food is cooked across the road and served inside. We ordered Chicken Seekh Kebab, Chicken Tikka, Rumali Roti, Chicken Bhuna, and Chicken Dum Biryani. The food looked basic but tasted quite good.

Service was a bit disorganized‚Äîthey didn‚Äôt provide cutlery or meal plates initially. We had to start eating the biryani using the small plates available at the table, and only afterward were we given proper meal plates. Portions were on the smaller side, but we didn‚Äôt have to wait long outside‚Äîgot called in within 5 minutes, though there was a wait at the table before our order was taken."
4,"I recently visited Bademiyan Colaba, and overall, it was a good experience. The food was delicious, and the service was quick, though there are still areas that could be improved.

Food Quality & Taste

The taste was definitely the highlight of the visit. I ordered the Chicken Roll and Mutton Seekh Kebab, and both were flavorful, juicy, and well-spiced. The kebabs had the perfect smoky flavor, and the rolls had a great balance of chutney and meat. However, the portion sizes were a bit smaller than expected for the price.

Service

The service was fast and efficient, which was a pleasant surprise. Despite the crowd, our food arrived within 10-15 minutes. The staff was quick in taking orders and bringing the food, though they could be a bit more attentive when it comes to customer requests.

Hygiene & Cleanliness

While the food was great, the hygiene standards could be better. The tables were not cleaned properly between customers, and the overall cleanliness of the area could use improvement. Since it's a famous spot, better hygiene would enhance the experience.

Pricing

The food is on the expensive side, with a meal for two easily costing around ‚Çπ1000 or more. While the taste is good, the pricing could be a little more reasonable. There are other great options in Mumbai offering similar flavors at better prices.

Overall Experience

Bademiyan still holds up as a good spot for delicious kebabs and rolls. The great taste make it worth a visit, though they could improve hygiene and pricing."
5,"Fabulous as always. After a late arrival flight, had to visit for a very very late dinner. Still buzzing, but quick to order and quick to serve. I had the food for takeaway. Had the lamb sheikh Kabab roll and chicken tikka roll. Both were excellent, nicely spiced and tasty. One would have been enough for 1 person

There are tables and chairs in the building opposite. Non-alcoholic drinks only"
5,"Known for their kebabs.
Had Mutton seekh kebab, chicken tikka and rumali roti.
mutton seekh kebab is a must try.
kebaab served with onions, lime, red and green chutney.
red chutney is spicy.
they have seperate veg and non-veg sections.
place is busy and service could be fast."
5,"A very cozy restaurant with a bar /pub on the ground floor level and regular dining area on the first floor.
Found the Ambience, Service and food excellent.
They have a wide range of drinks and cocktails on offer and an extensive European menu.
All in all a Lovely place for a casual outing."
5,"Amazing hidden bar with a cosy, yet classical style!

The waiters are providing a splendid service and the prices are decent. Food tastes amazing and is a mix of indian-western style cuisine.

They have local beer on tab, which is kinda nice and a happy hours, perfect for starting your late afternoons in a right way. Definitely recommend, to check this bar out!!"
5,The pasta was superb. But the dish that blew me away was their dessert special of the day. It was called a strawberry butter cake. It is hands-down the most delicious dessert I have tasted in my life! You've got to go there and try it!
5,"Amazing place! We went around the Christmas time, and boy it was worth it. The ambience, the music the special menu and the people, everything was excellent.
The best was the mulled wine I tried and had more of it, loved it! Must go if in colaba!"
5,"Amazing place serving scrumptious food. Service is top notch. Staff are friendly, experienced and courteous. Ambience is good and seating is comfortable too. Tried appetizers and Pizza, everything was delicious. Rates are fair. Parking is difficult to find."
4,"Peaceful place to be in. We had a family dinner buffet. Ambience is good. Buffet section was exclusive for us which was relaxing and fun with family and friends.
Food was quite good . Sushi was too good. Should surely try Mini falafel and khowsuey.
Staff was polite and always happy to serve.
Overall a good experience.  Would recommend going with family and friends."
5,Been here twice recently with friends and service has been excellent and the food too was yummy and wide choice for eat all you like buffet. . It's spacious and comfortable n great for meeting friends.   And so different from the suburbs and a great change and easy to reach via the Sealink and Coastal road.
5,"Celebrated the birthday here !
Very good food , Ambience.
Staff very courteous.
4 options of welcome drinks served on the table all the time.
Hot food buffet !
Live chat counter !"
5,"Went there by booking a solo seat for me.
For people who drink, they have amazing draught beers.
I had a veggie lover pizza.
I carried the remaining pizza with me.
The dough and vegetables were fresh.
The staff was friendly and I was delighted to meet Stanley and Sandeep who made my experience fun and suggested good drinks and starters. üôÇ
Thank you for a worthy experience."
1,"Frankly the portions are not worth the price.

Ambience - It's located in duct area of commercial complex with toilet windows surrounding you.

We ordered Chicken Bao , Dimsums and Khaw suey but the taste was average and not worth the price."
1,"Was sold very stale rasmalai and  Kalakand today morning.
Their quality has dropped terribly since the last time I visited.

Please be very careful...they are selling old stale food... which can cause you bad stomach infection.

Sadly...I had to throw what I bought."
2,"Bad quality snacks , fried or prepared in old oil where on opening the snack you can smell the old oil , bought mixed nuts also , was stale .
I bought an assortment of snacks to bring home ( abroad ) was disappointed and threw most away ."
1,Always an unpleasant experience at the Colaba Camy. Surly shop attendants who treat a customer as an interruption to their placid life. Go to the Gowalia Tank Camy if possible. It's best to steer clear of the Colaba lazy staff.
5,"Amazing place to get fresh snacks and sweets. It has become my favorite place to go, almost regularly. Breads and gujarati snacks are very fresh and tasty. Potato wafers are amazing and the oil used is also very good."
5,Chips always rely on camy they are too good
4,"I chose The J because I had tried their fries once (Andheri center) and really liked them. I went at around 9pm-9:30pm. They had no burgers left, hence I was left with only the fries, drinks and onion rings options. The drinks and onion rings were too common hence I didn't choose it.

The Schezwan Cheese Fries and Nacho fries I ordered were really good. Took around 10-15 min to get my order.

What I didn't like is that they do not have any place/station for sanitising/washing hands before eating. Also they barely have a seating capacity for around 9 people and 3 tables. Once occupied the only option you have is to stand.

Regardless, the food is good, if the burgers were available I would have included information about it too."
5,"The J's at churchgate is truly a vibes by itself, tucked right beside the alleyway of a building, the unique presence gives a nostalgic feeling of temptation just from the smell of hot fries when you come near it. The selection on the menu makes you wonder if anything is gonna be missed by selecting one thing, ending up selecting half the menu. The sitting arrangement is wonderful with a wall of notes and a corner for stray pets that takes your heart. Just a wonderful place to be at. Keep it up team!"
4,"Good fries, decent place.
I visited it once when I was there at the star bazaar which is in front of this. The fries were good though the inside of store/kitchen looked a bit shabby, something that can be worked upon."
5,The best place to have fries. This place brought the concept of fries topped up with sauces and toppings. Since then they have many competition in the market but no one comes even near them when it comes to serving quality. Fries are perfectly cooked and sauces are tasty as well. They also have tasty shakes and now they have started burgers as well.
4,"This place is famous for its fries n trust me they are super delicious, they also offers you a heart shaped note to stick ok their wall with a written note, it's not a very spacious place, has a very small sitting with high chairs, their serving style is unique  it's a self-service place. They serve halal food. Chipotle fries n Magic fries are must, do give them a try u won't regret üòã"
5,"I can not write disadvantage. Got table immediately, waiter came and served us within 10 min with our order. Prices are normal, food had good taste. We tried gulab jamun (pic with 2 dumplings). Sweet dessert. I updated the menu."
5,"Situated near the famous flora fountain and Bombay High Court. It is a good place for having your meal with a couple of drinks. Sitting for family is at first floor. Good and courteous staffs. The food was really tasty. Avoid going there between 1 to 3 pm, being the lunch time of high court, you may hardly get any place to sit."
1,"I‚Äôve been a regular customer at this place and frequently order food, especially since I work nearby. Unfortunately, the service has really gone downhill. I recently asked for a delivery just a 2-minute walk from the restaurant and was told they couldn‚Äôt do it because the new staff aren‚Äôt familiar with the area. It‚Äôs disappointing, especially in 2025, that staff can‚Äôt ask for a simple landmark or use Google Maps. My address is right next to a well known restaurant, yet the person on the phone still refused. It‚Äôs hard to understand how staff can be hired without basic problem solving or communication skills. Sadly, I won‚Äôt be returning."
4,"Wish I could give them 5 stars for the food and service, but the entire bathroom area on the 1st floor smells like cigarette smoke.

Leave it to the bars to have some pretty amazing food. Everything we had here was delicious. They even had karari roti and sitafel ice cream! Service was stellar as well. Food took some time to arrive but the waiters kept us informed without us asking and rountinely came by to check on us. They did not linger around and just stare either.

If they could get people to smoke elsewhere, this would easily be a 5 star restaurant."
4,"Our go-to quarter bar in the Fort area and a popular one too! We arrived early and the place filled up quickly. There was a queue when we left. The food here is very good - we had unda bhurji, chicken crispy, chicken chilli, mandeli fry and chana garlic. A great nite out with friends"
5,"You can find unique indian sweets, classic sweets as well as pastries there either to eat on spot or tale away.  We were baffled by the quality and the deliciousness of the sweets.  They do not use too much sugar and the taste is very fresh.  You also have a large variety of pastries and samoosas to go along with your chai.  They are helpful to explain you the ingredients and help you choose.  Price is also very good.  You just chooses your sweets, pastries and they will give you tickets to pay at the cashier.  They sell most sweets by kg."
5,It was a pure luck finding this place while walking the market. It is clean and sweets taste good. Many varieties to choose from. Many employees to help u with your needs. Good place to go to sweeten your visit to Colaba market.
1,"I had the most terrible experience at

5,Its an authentic sweet shop with verities of good quality and tasty Indian sweets and snacks. Home delivery and take away services available. Accept all debit and credit card payments. Neat and hygienic shop. Good service and nice staffs. Easily accessible from the main road. No separate parking is available.
1,"Pathetic behaviour of the cash counter guy & owner,they don‚Äôt respect customers,they have in juice glasses take away for gulab jamun & radmalai consisting qty of 20 each,very rude & disrespectful behaviour"

I Miss Ruth had visited this Udipi Hotel I had ordered fried rice the rice was burnt and it was smelling disgusting and that's how we told the waiter the rice is smelling. Didn't even replying the coustomer he took the fried rice n brought the fresh one when he brought the fresh fried rice there was a hair in it
And the waiter is saying to me please wait don't cancel the order after that the one who cooked the fried rice he came and started arguing with me saying it may be yours hair I told him the hair is inside the rice then I said please stop it. please don't argue like this if it's your mistake accept it And then the owner came to us n not even said a word üò°

Felt very disappointed even the owner of the hotel did not say a sorry

Worst Hotel ever in Mumbai

The cook doesn't know to talk with the customer"
3,I found this place to be just okay. We ordered a masala dosa and vegetables‚Äã cheese grill sandwich. It took some time to come but sandwich was good. I expected something more from the dosa though. It was just okay in taste. Sambhar was lil less spicy but chutney was covering for it. I would service on  moderate level and overall experience also okay.
3,veg restaurant in fort horniman circle. Nothing  so special about taste. Prices are little less compared to surrounding restaurants.  Pulao is not really good. It tastes something oily or may be vanaspati is used. Tea is ok. Even misal and pavbhaji also can be tried.
1,"Order was delayed. The food is pathetic, you can't even rate how pathetic. Mix Veg navratna had orange in it that spoiled the taste of whole dish. The only thing good was chapati. The chikoo milkshake was a complete disaster. Even if you're very hungry, it's highly likely that you may not like the food. Not a good restaurant for an explorer or a foodie."
5,"Best South Indian food, you get food for free if you know the owner."
1,"I was highly dissatisfied and DISSAPONTED with the experience at Leopold cafe. Upon searching online and confirming with the manager over a call for a pet friendly care they asked me bring my pet only to be told that they allow ONLY 1 table for pets  which is near the entrance of the cafe with NO AIR CONDITIONER. We were made to sit in the sweltering heat.

IT IS A VERY WRONG INFO TO GIVE IT AND SAY IS A PET FRIENDLY Cafe.

The overall ambience is very dissapointing and has to AC for the guests.

The quality of the food is not too good as well.

GO AT UR OWN RISK"
4,"Foreigners love hanging out here. I saw a group of english men & women having a great evening after their work. Hard to find a place. I had to wait for a couple of minutes, It's one of the most iconic and crowded cafes in the world.  Food was good as usual. The ambience is just like the way it has to be, old school! The menu is over priced for the locals. No parking!!"
3,"This place is so hyped.

I told the waiter that salt is very less in chicken lollipop.

His answer was "" We put less salt on purpose so that everyone is satisfied.""

Dear Leopold cafe, Please I understand how much salt is more or less.

Please train your staff to be more professional and not to give arrogant answers.

I recommend visiting only for a while to enjoy the ambience and quick bite.

Many different options for better food."
5,"Yesterday I visited Colaba Mumbai ,the oldest Cafe Leopold Cafe and became a part of History .

2,"If you‚Äôre like OMG! I have heard a lot about this place, it must be a really good place, blah blah blah.

Then please don‚Äôt dine in. It is a very congested
place with no proper dinner experience even after you pay a good amount. The place I was asked to sit didn‚Äôt have enough place to even keep two plates, the cutlery was kept on the window.

Food is literally just basic that you would expect from any common pasta place.

Visit if you just wanna have decent food, and not because of the hype."

4,"Famous eatery amongst Mumbai's lawyer community and stock market traders. Located just next lane to the Bombay stock exchange and opposite of the Mumbai high court.  During breakfast finding a seat is very difficult as most of the tables are occupied by lawyers and their clients and associates. The food is very good in taste. Upma and sheera along with dosa are flying through the kitchen every 2 minutes during rush hrs. We tried upma , sheera and Puri bhaji. The signature dish here is sheera. Super tasty."
3,"Tried their cheese rawa dosa and idli sambar i was bit excited with their South Indian menu but the taste was just average with both sambar and chutney, instead of regular coconut chutney they serve orange color chutney i think which is made of gun powder."
1,"I ordered dal khichadi ...
But this is not dal khichadi this is dal mix with rice. No tadka no garlic nothing in this ..."
3,"Not giving detailed reviews as the place isn't worth the detailed review.

Avoid going if craving for a good snack."
5,"I recently dined at The Mumbai Masala Restaurant in Mumbai and really enjoyed it. The food was flavorful, especially the North Indian dishes, and the menu had a good variety. The service was quick, and the staff was polite and attentive. The ambiance was cozy, making it a great spot for both casual meals and family outings. Overall, a solid choice if you're looking for good food and a comfortable dining experience in Mumbai!
One should definitely visit this place for awesome food and great ambiance!"
1,"Looks nothing like the pictures. The menu changes throughout the day with various sections ending at different times. There is no toilet for customers to use and only a sink to wash hands.
The food is inexpensive and reflects the quality and service.
We were brought the wrong food and it was not communicated well what the problem was and could have resulted in allergic reactions. This was not handled well by the staff."
4,"Small restaurant for decent vegetarian food. The rates are reasonable. I have tried food here couple of times. The main course and sandwich were very average in taste, however, the mix pakoda was good. Service was good and fast. The staff are polite and friendly. Parking is difficult to find in this area."
4,"Mumbai Masala is a new cozy Vegetarian restaurant in Narayanguda.
When you enter the place you witness fancy lightning column, sleek orange interiors which creates the fun, joy and playfulness atmosphere. Orange is a great colour choice because it stimulates the appetite and also encourages social interaction. Being foodaholic, I like everything from street food, fast food joints to cafe's and regular restaurants. This place is serving varity of cuisines with finest quality taste which makes this place interesting. If you wanna have thalis, proper north Indian and south indian food or any quick bites head here if you find yourself around. Each section on the menu has the timings written for when the dishes are available. Starting off with mocktails tried blue lagoon and Virgin mojito which were okay. Also, tried sweet Lassi and Oreo Milkshake according to me milkshake needs little improvisation.
Moving on to the appetizers section tried Crunchy manchurian dry which was spicy, crisp faultlessly tossed tasted great. Crispy Corn makes a ideal starter for veg's and it was palatable.
Chinese Bhel: This is my all time favourite chat which is made with fried noodles perked up with crunchy vegetables which was so appetizing.
Italian Paniyaram: This balls were made with green's and others veggies coated with breadcrumbs and deep fried topped with cheese.
Rumali Masala Papad topped with Indian chopped masala, lime, coriander and finely chopped fresh veggies. Nachos were served with cheese and bean's were flawless.
Vol-au-vents: It's a puff pastry stuffed with corn delivered maximum flavour when paired with cheese.
Vada Pav Dabeli Combo name itself says it's a combination snack the pav has both dabeli and vada pav flavour
Mumbai Masala Pizza: The pizza was quite good with a desi twist and loaded with lots of veggies, paneer and cheese.
Masala Garlic bread: Desi garlic bread tasted good and was having the perfect amount of the cheese and veggies added to it.
Pav Bhaji: It was served piping hot with flavourful bhaji
Moving to the much anticipated main course Mumbai Masala didn't disappoint one little bit. Veg Chatpat and Paneer Toofani were the curries of the day which were very well enjoyed with the hot, fluffy and soft breads. Paneer Toofani was having to kinds of curries half of the curry tasted like butter paneer masala and the other half tasted like palak paneer which was served in cabbage leaf. Coming to breads tried Lachha paratha, Kashmiri paratha, Lal mirch ka Paratha, kothmir butter naan, Chilli garlic naan, Masala kulcha, Kothmir butter roti and butter naan. Tried combination fried rice which was served with wet manchurian with an awesome presentation. Lastly, from the main course tried veg dum biryani which was soulful.
As, for desserts they don't have elaborate menu. Tried moong dal ka halwa set to perfection with drizzle of dry fruits. Sundae icecream was also good.
The service staff was pleasingly hospitable making sure there was never ever a moment where the diner's are waiting with empty plates.
Overall Taste:4/5

Authentic taste for chole and Lassi that had to be eaten with spoon, not diluted by excess sugar with dollop of makkhan on top...
Loved it..."
5,"""I had a very good experience, indulging in delicious vegetarian Indian food! The standout dish was undoubtedly the Choley Bhatura - crispy, fluffy bhatura paired perfectly with a flavorful and spicy choley.
Not oily yet full of flavour and use of spices showed it's something they are very good with.
I appreciated the minimal oil usage and fresh ingredients used throughout the meal. The attentive service and cozy ambiance added to the charm. Whether you're a vegetarian foodie or just seeking authentic Indian flavors, is a must-visit. 5/5 stars for food quality, service, and value! Highly recommended for veggie lovers."""
4,"Ok kind of place. I have some legacy food from North India. Sales are brisk but overall this place needs a lot of care and maintenance because if you are making people sit and eat, you cannot convert the sitting area into a storage, atleast not in Mumbai."

""Average food, poor service. Staff seemed disinterested, owner didn't care. Unattentive and unpleasant experience. Not worth visiting."""

Definite try here is Dal Pakwan, Samosa & Pattice Chhole, Chhole Bhature or Puri, Aaloo Paratha & Special Lassi.
Staff here is very courteous, helping u in giving each product accurate info. Place is neat & clean.

In short 100% try this if u r true foodie to get satisfactory taste."

The seafood is fresh and really tasty. Ambiance is decent ‚Äî nothing fancy, but comfortable. Definitely worth visiting if you enjoy coastal cuisine!"
4,"Located across two floors this 35 year old restaurant serves very good sea food at reasonable prices. Menu is large innovative and well representing southern India. Hygiene and cleanliness is well attended. Service is helpful, courteous and professional. Asian kitchen closes at 4PM, restricting the options. Only upper floor section was open for dining where movement is a bit difficult given all those overhead structures."
5,"Just experienced a fantastic meal at the iconic Bharat Excellensea, a 35-year-old gem in Mumbai's Ballard Estate! The restaurant has been recently revamped, and the ambiance is now even more inviting. But the real star is the food!

As a self-proclaimed seafood addict, I was in heaven. I sampled a wide range of dishes, each bursting with flavor and freshness.

The Tom Kha Soup was a fragrant and comforting start. The Prawns Butter Garlic were perfectly cooked and incredibly flavorful. The *Yellow Chili Prawns  packed a delicious spicy punch. The Surmai Masala Fry was a classic done exceptionally well. The Thalasseri Clams were a fiery delight, showcasing the flavors of Kerala. The Rawas Gassi was a rich and creamy Mangalorean-style curry. The Neer Dosa and Appam were the perfect accompaniments to soak up the delicious gravies.

But the real surprise was the Sitaphal Tricones Holige! This innovative dessert was a delightful fusion of Indian and modern flavors. A must-try!

Overall:
Bharat Excellensea is a must-visit for any seafood lover in Mumbai. The restaurant offers a wide variety of fresh, flavorful dishes with influences from across India's coastal regions. The recent revamp has enhanced the dining experience, making it a perfect spot for a special occasion or a memorable meal. Highly recommended!"
4,"We had the seafood thali , taste was great had clamps, squid and prawns , one neer dosa , and boiled rice , it was all filling and we liked it however for the cost would  expect minimum two neer dosa in one plate and little  more curry , we order more just to feel complete thali . the buttermilk was sad .Best part was the mouth freshener given in the end  , was great overall experience."
5,"Really enjoyed our dinner on Saturday. The service was friendly and attentive. The best though was the food, delicious seafood selections expertly cheffed. Thoroughly recommend.

We didn‚Äôt scrimp on what we selected, and everything was very fresh and tasty.

It was quiet - but explained afterwards to us that because it‚Äôs in the business area busy times are during the week rather than weekend."
4,"The ambience was cozy and vintage we liked the low key vibe it was comfortable.
The food was good too, our server akash ubale was courteous and served us well.

Chef Sandeep was sweet enough to enquire us about food and experience and was friendly we liked the gesture.

However, we dint really like the approach of Captain Mahesh Sharma, we felt his attitude was a bit off towards us.
His body language was unfriendly and it made us feel unwanted at the place.

The management should take note of the above mentioned."
3,Service was ok but food was very disappointing. The paneer tikka was so rubbery and cottage cheese steak was stale. The only nice dishes were Reshmj Murg Tikka and Lobster Thermidor. The restaurant had such a lovely reputation before . If you see the menu on Zomato it is very  Elaborate but when we reached it was a very small menu with limited dishes.
2,"I came with my family to celebrate my results, expecting this was a good hotel. However, the AC was not working. We were recommended to have the pink sauce spaghetti which is apparently their speciality. That was completely average and not upto the mark. For main course, the quantity of the food is very less and the prices are all hiked up. Overall, very average experience, would not come again !!
Expected better service !"
5,"A perfect place for evening date with your beau and a perfect blend of food and ambiance made the evening even more special. The food was lovely and the desserts added more sweetness to my evening. The food was delicious and delicately made with the essence of great flavours and the service added perfection even more. We had a oriental form of cuisine Chinese base and sweet corn soup, frozen litchees and chocolate pastry for the dessert and ginger base and guava base mocktail to accompany. Lovely evening. Hoping to visit here soon."
5,Its a nice serene place with old world charm. The food is excellent. The service is good. We were served by Mahendra and Aakash and both were very prompt and great in their work.
5,"Very close to the churchgate train station. The restaurant has a feel of nostalgic setup and they maintain the standards for food and service.
I ordered Saboothana vada, a samosa and a cup of chai. All these were good, nominal usage of oil in the dishes i have been served. The cost is also nominal, a nice place to try the Mumbai recipes."
4,"This place is very close to churchgate station & a very reasonable place to sit & eat.
The Misal Pav is extremely spicy, if you can't deal with spice please don't have that. I also have Deluxe Thali which was good & reasonable. Their Sheera is very good & Sabudana. Pav Bhaji is okay but good for the price they charge. A very decent, clean place. Puri Bhaji is also average"
5,"I recently discovered this caf√© while working on my photography project at Church Gate railway station. The food tastes great, and the place has an old caf√© vibe. The staff is very polite. I didn't know they only accepted cash. After finishing my meal, I asked to pay via UPI, but they informed me that they only accept cash, and I didn't have any on me. They kindly told me it was okay and that I didn't need to pay. However, I returned to the caf√© later to settle my bill. The next day, I came back and had Podi idli."
5,It was a great experience being here. I took delux thali n food was amazing best part was it was not at all spicy.
4,"Bharat Caf√©, located near Churchgate in Mumbai, is known for its simple, South Indian vegetarian fare. Here‚Äôs a summary of average comments from customers:

Food: The dosas, idlis, and vadas are popular. Many customers praise the authentic South Indian flavors. The filter coffee is also well-liked.

Price: Reasonable pricing, making it a good option for budget-friendly meals.

Ambience: Basic and no-frills. Not fancy but functional, with fast service.

Service: Efficient, though not particularly warm. It‚Äôs more about quick service than a cozy dining experience.

Overall, it's often described as a convenient spot for a quick, affordable meal, especially for South Indian food lovers."
4,"I recently visited Subh Sagar Pure Veg Restaurant and tried their Rawa Masala Dosa. The taste was really good, with a crispy texture and well-balanced flavors in the masala filling. The chutneys and sambar complemented the dish perfectly.

The ambience of the restaurant is soothing, making it a comfortable place to enjoy a meal. The environment is clean and well-maintained, adding to the overall dining experience. Located on the left side towards the Gateway of Mumbai, it‚Äôs a convenient spot for a quick and tasty meal.

Overall, a great place for South Indian food lovers. Definitely worth a visit!"
5,"I recently visited Subh Sagar Restaurant in Colaba, Mumbai, and had a delightful experience. Their menu offers a unique array of dishes that are both flavorful and well-prepared. The hospitality stood out, with the staff being incredibly attentive and friendly. A highlight of the visit was the chocolate brownie‚Äîrich, decadent, and an absolute must-try. Subh Sagar is a fantastic spot for anyone looking to enjoy great food and excellent service in Colaba."
4,"Shubh Sagar is an air-conditioned restaurant offering a diverse menu with Punjabi, South Indian, Pav Bhaji, and more. Everything available in vegetarian and Jain.
The nachos with salsa are a standout, as is the Pav Bhaji. The dosa and idli are also excellent, showcasing authentic flavors. The Hakka noodles are a delightful option as well. The pizza, while tasty, has a distinct 'desi' twist, which may not appeal to everyone, but it's worth trying if you're looking for something unique"
3,"Excellent service , the taste of the food is bit okaay .
We ordered 3 dishes .
Sandwich 2/5
Sandwich had boiled potatoes inside it which not at all taste good and there was no sauces just vegetables placed inside bread.
Dosa 3/5
French fries - 4/5
The seating arrangement is good .
It has variety of food , but what we ordered was not so good , not so bad ."
5,I had Panner koliwada which was for ‚Çπ300 it was tasty and moderate spicy. Masala papad is must try (‚Çπ60). Later on we tried strawberry shake which costed ‚Çπ185 it was moderate Next thing was masala chaas ‚Çπ60 good taste. Also the butter rooti was too expensive ‚Çπ50 each. Lastly for dessert we had ‚Çπ125 caramel custard. It was good with pista and nuts.
1,"Dear people!! This is one of the oldest restaurant and juice centre near Bomaby hospital Marines lines and I had been visiting this place from last more than 20years.. Over the time it has degraded the quality of food and juices and also the hygeine level is very poor. The cooks and people making jucice sandwitches are not following basic cleanliness and hygiene and they charge very costly for all items on name of being oldest restaurant. The cooks doesnt even wear basic gloves at time of any preparations of juice, pab bhaji or sandwitches. They use dirty hands and clothes in cooking area. I strictly advise not to buy any stuffs for patient admitted in hospital as the quality and hygiene issues can lead to severe other health problems for patients admitted in hospital."
2,"The place is located just next to Bombay hospital. They have such a strict ""no outside food"" policy they didn't even allow a patient to have his tiffin even though the other family member ordered from the restaurant. The staff also behaved rudely."
5,"I visited this place yesterday with my family, I loved the new look and fresh menu with some exciting varieties of Juices and Milkshakes. Have been visiting this place for the last 20 Years, excellent Food and Ambience. Must visit, One of the Best Places for Juices and Fast Food in SOBO...."
4,We got ice cream.All the given options are not available in Menu.Service was good
5,Delicious Fresh Juice and Milkshake. Cool environment and fast service. Located opp Liberty Cinema.
4,"Indian and Asian restaurant have all the delicious food and the taste is very delicious and the price is suitable for everyone. We have ordered several options including chicken biryani, butter chicken, fried shrimp and Nan bread I advise you to visit him because he deserves it and its price is reasonable."
4,"Sahibaan is a popular restaurant located in Colaba. The food here is simply amazing. Although the prices are a little on the higher side, it's totally worth the taste and quantity offered. The ambience is good. They have good music playing in the background to keep up the vibe in the restaurant while eating. A place you can visit with your friends for lunch or dinner dates."
5,"One of the best places in Mumbai for Chinese food. Really good quality and their delicacies are amazing. Atmosphere is great too. Not too bright and some level of fencing between each table section to give you some comfort and separation from other guests. Service is great too. I love their chicken wings, it's spicy and tender."
3,"Certain dishes in this restaurant are certainly good like their pot rice, hoisin chicken. But the food is certainly over priced here and the restaurant is not very clean too. I found a dead cockroach outside the washroom. It's better to order in food from here rather than to visit the restaurant and sit and eat. Also their chicken momos were disapppointing. The Prasumma frozen momos are better. But the service of the staff here was good. The staff was helpful towards my mother who couldn't walk."
1,"So we recently went to this restaurant in the evening.The resturant wasn't that busy and we could peacefully enjoy our food.

Sahibaan Oriental and Indian Resturant is a restaurant located in the heart of Colaba. It is a popular one for both locals and tourists.

The food is consistently good, with dishes that are flavorful. Portion sizes are generous, and the presentation is also appealing.

I would not recommend the sizzling Ice cream brownie from here,it was rather too hot and the brownie was not up to the mark.

The service staff were attentive and professional.
If you are looking for a special occasion restaurant in Mumbai, Then this is an good option.

Note:-As the serving portion of our spring roll was large we asked the waiter to pack it up,but forgot to pick it up when paying the bill.Please do not do this mistake as we did. If anyone wishes to parcel the food they didn't finish,remind them during bill payment.

Here is the list of food we ordered:-
Chicken Spring Roll
Chicken Lollipop
Pot Noodles
Sizzling Ice Cream Brownie

Overall, I would highly recommend The Sahibaan Oriental and Indian Resturant to anyone looking for a great dining experience in Colaba. It is a bit on the expensive side, but the quality of the food, service, and atmosphere is worth it.

Second time went there on 15 August 2024 suffered from severe food poisoning. Never going back here."
4,I really loved the vibe of this place. It was jam packed. I ordered a stone oven Garden fresh veg pizza and a chicago style meat pie. The veg pizza was good with a lot of veggies and very cheesy. The meat pie was piled high with bacon and pepperoni. The pizza sauce was a bit too sweet for me otherwise it was really good. If the sauce was on point then the rating would have been 5.
5,"I'm obsessed with this spot! It's my go-to destination, and for good reason. Every time I try something new, I discover another comfort food favorite. Whenever I'm at Marine Drive, I always end up here, because their mouthwatering, delicious food is irresistible. The service is consistently amazing, and it's become a staple for me - I've lost count of how many times I've visited! Whether I'm with friends, family, or flying solo, this place always delivers. Plus, they have a great selection of games, making it the perfect spot to hang out and enjoy incredible food. Highly recommend!"
4,"What an amazing place to visit with your loved ones and create unforgettable memories! With cozy corners filled with books, fun games to enjoy, and absolutely delicious food paired with excellent service, this place truly stole my heart. Whether you're looking for a relaxing afternoon or a fun-filled evening, it has something for everyone. A perfect blend of comfort, entertainment, and great hospitality!"
5,"Went to Mockingbird Cafe Bar in Mumbai on a Saturday night for dinner and loved it! The pumpkin fenugreek soup was cozy, blending sweet and earthy flavors perfectly. The French fries were crispy and addictive, while the harvest pizza was fresh and delicious with a spot-on crust. The vibe was warm, and board games added a fun twist for hanging out. Service was friendly and attentive, though it slowed a bit as the crowd grew. At ‚Çπ1200 for two, the quality and portions felt like a steal. I‚Äôm excited to return for more tasty food and games!"
4,"Good place to dine. Happy with the food, Portions could have been better. No parking available"
3,"Wok Express, food taste and quality is not an issue but this restaurant needs serious makeover.
I visited it recently as I like their food.
It is situated on the prime location and easily noticed.
The Air conditioning was not working and it was very hot and humid inside, all people were sweating hence on request they kept main door open. Their kitchen is inside which increases heat inside.
Ambience is not good and it feels like you are sitting in basement parking.
Service is slow. It took more than 15 minutes to get my order. Drinking water was not cold.
They didn't have ice hence they were unable to serve us drinks. Can it be an excuse.....!
Food taste and quality is good.
Visit it only if you don't want air conditioning and you are ready to wait for a long time till you get an order."
4,"Space is small however the taste of food was good. It's near marine lines. The Ambience was decent with Fans on, AC wasn't on. We visited during dine out offer where we got 50% off offer"
4,"Delectable food offered to its visitors and a decent variety of Indo Chinese meals to sate your belly, it is a good experience should you visit Churchgate.

The place is well maintained and has an affluent vibe going for it, encouraging anyone to soak in what appears to be pleasant ambience. It is easy to enjoy the place with the quality of food that you would eventually end up buying. It takes roughly 500-600 rupees to get a good meal for 2-3 people, which is suitable enough.

I have rated it four stars since the delivery was rather slow and the experience wasn't costumer centric even at 3 pm on a Tuesday. Adding onto this, they used a lot more oil than they should have and to compensate for lack of chicken/soya chunks they overdid veggies."
2,"Okay so had another visit to this place yesterday.
They personally guided us, the waiting time period needs to be moderated more to attract the customers.
This time we had the same Menu once more and this was it‚ô•Ô∏è. I found it up to the point as I was expecting with Wok Express, the quality was good , including the TASTE of every particular item .
I am happy with the food as the meal had a good amount of taste as it is mentioned in the Menu , right ingredients was added on it not as my last experience.
Suggestion will be to improve Choco Lava a little
Rest I found it good and helpful."
1,"I have been there today... There is no hygienic and cleaninngness maintenance by staff they are very rude  and taste is third class and I feel it's totally waist of money. I suggest do not visit this place ever if you want to go for taste n budget friendly food , ambience."
5,"Burger King: A Quick Bite Near the Junction

Burger King is a solid choice for those needing a fast and satisfying meal, especially with its convenient location near the railway station. Here's a breakdown of what makes it a great option:

In conclusion, Burger King is a reliable spot for a quick and tasty meal, and its location near the railway station is a definite plus."
4,"‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Good Burgers, but Room for Improvement

I recently visited Burger King on Church Street, Mumbai, and had a fairly good experience. The burgers were flavorful, and the staff was friendly and courteous, which made the visit enjoyable. The ambiance was clean and comfortable, making it a decent spot for a quick meal.

However, I did notice slightly inconsistent food quality, as my fries weren‚Äôt as fresh as expected. While service was decent, it could be a bit faster, especially during peak hours. Also, pricing feels a little high for the portion sizes.

Overall, a solid option for a quick bite, but some improvements in food consistency and speed of service would make the experience even better!"
5,"Just opposite to churchgate railway station, this Burger King cafe is a hunger saviour. There is AC section and non AC section. I had the limited edition Spicy Korean Paneer Burger under Korean Spicy Fest. Burger was good in taste and the Korean sauce was very tasty and spicy. Paneer patty was crisp. Overall this outlet serves good food"
1,"I visited Burger King late at night feeling low and hoping to grab some food. However, your staff member, Vishal Sharma, refused to serve me food and told me only they are serving is beverages and unprofessionally asked me to leave the restaurant, despite other customers being seated and waiting for their takeaway orders. This incident reflects a disappointing lack of professionalism and service standards. Such behavior is unacceptable and undermines customer trust. I strongly advise others to reconsider visiting this establishment, as experiences like this can tarnish the reputation of even well-known brand like Burger King."
5,Food is good but when we order from app by entering table number they will not serve on table but other outlets do
4,"Good place to eat near museum, especially for tourists who want to enjoy hygienic food in budget. I have tries special veg thali that was really good."
4,"Quaint little place with good menu options. Ofcourse it's a canteen and is always busy and doesn't provide a premium dining experience. But food is wholesome. It's an MLA hostel connected canteen and right next to Mantralaya, the seat of power in Mumbai. If you are around and hungry then good place for a meal. üòä"
3,Staff won‚Äôt listen to anyone service is good  and food is also nice
2,"Food was not good for the rate we have paid..
Due to the crowd they serve unworthy food in spite of our on site complaint"
1,"Rates are like MLA but Food quality Like 3rd Grade Party Workers and also behaviour of waiter like Minister.
Some day ago I just order Schezwan Chicken Fried Rice with hard chilli but they give me regular order and also keep the bowls of soya dark sos, Tomato chili sos and vinegar with chill chops. üòÇüôà
Here have Just tea is good. Don't eat here food quality is worst With rates.
If you have hungry go to Air india circle and eat it there have multy options with good quality and after roam at marine drive.
Just checked bellow bill and order of Schezwan chicken fried rice.
i'm payed on table so now is my turn."
4,"Wonderful flavours, Parking Not available, Staff is Cordial. Small place... Seating capacity for 10-15 people. Well ventilated, 5-9 mins walk from churchgate station."
5,"Now the berry season is going on they have various types of flavours available now like blueberry, raspberry, strawberry, mulberry,gooseberry and black currant. Also they give you this cute little passport, theu stamp it every time you get a new flavour.The Coffee Walnut is a perfect blend of bold coffee and crunchy walnut bits‚Äîa must-try for coffee lovers. The Roasted Almond is another winner, with its nutty crunch and rich, buttery taste. The quality of ingredients shines through in every bite."
4,"Nice ..
we got coconut, mango & coffee ‚Ä¶ rich in flavour üëçüèª
Its more like a sorbet than icecream"
4,"A cosy place. There is a lot of construction going on near this place hence for a newcomer you will not be able to know from the road that Natural ice cream shop is there. The administration needs to do something about it.
The place inside is good and the ambience is very homely and calm.
Another thing that I did not like about this place is that they do not have the flavours of ice cream that I wanted the most. They did not have the custard apple flavor.
The jackfruit and tender coconut flavors are very good. You can feel the pieces of jackfruit and tender coconut in the ice cream. The taste of the ice cream is also good."
5,"I am a long-time enthusiast of Naturals' Tender Coconut ice cream, but I also enjoy exploring their seasonal flavors. Today, I had the pleasure of trying their Mango Sunday, which offered a delightful twist on their classic mango ice cream. When ordering, I forgot to specify my preference, and to my surprise, the staff generously included a scoop of Malai ice cream with mango pieces. While it was a pleasant surprise, I still opted to add my favorite Tender Coconut scoop to create the ultimate combination.

The mango ice cream was rich and creamy, with a sweetness that was balanced by the tanginess of the mango pieces. The Malai ice cream added a smooth and velvety texture, but it was the Tender Coconut scoop that truly elevated the entire experience. The subtle coconut flavor and creamy texture complemented the mango perfectly, creating a harmonious blend of flavors and textures.

I appreciate Naturals' attention to detail and willingness to customize their offerings to suit individual tastes. The Mango Sunday is a great way to enjoy the flavors of the season, and I highly recommend adding a scoop of Tender Coconut to take it to the next level. Overall, Naturals continues to impress with their commitment to quality and customer satisfaction, making them a standout in the world of ice cream."
4,"Located in front of Marine drive with sea view is advantageous for good ambience. Cover charges for open air dining is 2500 pp which is too high. Food is ok but service is good. Plenty of parking. Can be recommended only for some special occasion, anniversary, Birthday if you are ok to pay high price for food and views."
5,"I recently hosted a business lunch with a client at L&S Bistro & Pizzeria at the InterContinental Marine Drive, and it turned out to be an excellent choice. The place strikes the perfect balance between professional and relaxed, with its quirky yet elegant d√©cor and cozy vibe. We chose to sit on the alfresco terrace, and the view of Marine Drive and the Arabian Sea added a refreshing touch to our meeting‚Äîdefinitely a conversation starter.

For lunch, we ordered the charcoal base pizza with burrata and pesto‚Äîsomething unique and full of flavour. We also tried the grilled fillet mignon steak, which was cooked to perfection, and the cheese fondue, which added a fun, informal touch to the table. The food impressed not just in taste but in presentation as well. To end on a sweet note, we shared the tiramisu in a jar‚Äîlight, rich, and satisfying.

The service was smooth and professional, which really helped keep the flow of our meeting comfortable and uninterrupted. If you‚Äôre looking to combine business with a quality dining experience, I‚Äôd highly recommend L&S Bistro. It‚Äôs a great place to leave a good impression‚Äîboth with the food and the atmosphere."
5,"We were at L & S Bistro & Pizzeria for lunch. The service was great and the ambience was good too. The white wine tasted pretty ok though it was an open bottle. The Caesar Salad with chicken was excellent. The veg pizza was fresh n of large size, for the main course we ordered fish with mashed potatoes. It was a relaxed and enjoyable afternoon."
5,Good food and good vibes but the staff was exceptional. Friendly and helpful they made the experience there just amazing.
4,"Long & Short, get amused by some fun cocktails at Intercontinental

Long & short is a pretty place surrounded on the first floor of intercontinental. The decor is a classic take. It is gorgeous with warm interiors and elegant couches

We tried the waffles menu which was good. We loved our strawberry Oreo chocolate syrup drenched.

The brownie point would go for the view of the queen's necklace which is gorgeous . You should sit in the balcony and just get yourself a drink.

Long and short itself means long cocktails- the big ones priced at around 1250‚Çπ+ which is expensive and short ones around 750‚Çπ+

The only thing which could be improved is quicker service. There was only one waiter catering to all on a Friday night.

We had such a lovely time overall enjoying the breeze, indulging onto our waffles; all overlooking the pretty marine drive ."

5,Exceptional flavour... Been visiting often since 42 years... Appreciate their Maintaining the same spices and ingredients... With grace and sincerity....
5,This place has one of the best vada pav in Mumbai. The vada is very tasty and the main magic is in its red chutney. This place serves only vada pav. I would recommend you to try this once. They close around 6-7 pm depending how early they sell all their vadas. One vada pav is ‚Çπ20. It is located exactly opposite to flora fountain.
5,My & all mumbaikar's favorite vadapav place.
5,"One of the Best Vada Pav stall in Mumbai, their speciality is garma garam Vada Pav with Red Lahsun chutney with fried green chilli, unique taste, eating their Vada Pavs for more than 2 decades, whenever I go to Fort area visit to this Vada Pav stall is must in my itinerary."
4,"It's a beautiful old hall. A little under-maintained, a little unkempt, but charming. It's a unique experience - worth a shot if you can find a member to take you there... Yep! Members only (and their guests!)!"
5,"Amazing food and beautiful antiques. Nice breeze even in summers , can sit for hours without a fan."
5,"A quaint Parsis only exclusive club bang opposite Mumbai High Court and Mumbai University, the spacious and airy Club has basic furniture and century old look but the food is awesome. After a nice lunch one can take a power nap on one of the many old style easy chairs which have leg extensions to put ones legs up and rest. One needs at least a Parsi friend to take you here. Wednesdays is Dhansak for lunch and the place gets overcrowded!"
5,It's only for members. But if you have a friend who is a member definitely go on Wednesday for the dhansak. Quaint place with old antique furniture and butler service with a smile. The club takes me back in time like a time machine. Spent many a lunch with my dad here. Very pleasant memories.
4,"A time capsule of a bygone era the Ripon Cub in Bombay. It's 137 years old and nothing has changed much since then. Possibly the couches have been reupholstered, and the walls have a fresh coat of paint. Time has stood still here with an old grandfather clock that still works and the most comfortable chairs to lounge in with outstretched arms after eating a heavy meal. Here I'm surrounded by memories of my grandfather and my father lunching here. And oh yes, until very recently women were not allowed to become members. So I suppose that's one of the biggest changes to have happened to the 137 year old club.

There are old portraits of stalwart Parsi gentleman everywhere who were the founders of this gentleman's club. We probably dined on the same tables and chairs as they did. A traditional and most ecological way of dining on banana leaves. This time capsule has been preserved for now, but not sure for how much longer it will remain with the sea of change in India, and as Parsees fast disappear in the sands of time and would have been just one moment in time in India's 5000 year old history."
5,"Wide variety of Parsee type foods. Limited quantity so sells out fast at lunchtime. Their chicken farchas, chicken mayo roll and ham sandwiches are superb. And the owner is very friendly and jovial."
5,The Tarapori patio is awesome.  Mutton cutlets n farcha also good. Am looking forward to trying more.
4,The food is very good . Food is authentic Parsi Cuisine and it is delicious . I just love it . You should try chicken puff . I just love that plus other dishes are also very good
5,That's good amazing
5,"I used to go over here maybe 20 years back & have chicken mayo roll, sandwich its awsome"

5,"Naturals Ice Cream never disappoints! I recently tried their Blueberry ice cream, and it was absolutely unique and delicious‚Äîrefreshingly different from anything I‚Äôve had before. But my all-time favorites remain Sitaphal (Custard Apple) and Tender Coconut‚Äîboth are incredibly creamy, fresh, and full of natural flavor.

The quality of ingredients and the rich, authentic taste make Naturals my go-to place for ice cream. Highly recommended for anyone who loves real fruit-based flavors!"
1,"Natural Ice cream never disappoints but service and behaviour of Staff matters too. Today I visited naturals with few guests. I visited Nallasopara west branch and upon asking for menu and icream flavours .. the behaviour of Staff was very rude. One of them said "" jo dikh raha hai display me vo hi hai dekh lo"".

After that while billing , Mr. vikas one of the staff member was very rude , he did not gave me even 2 seconds to let me make my orders, he just said ""jaldi bolo kya chaiye"" .

Staff behaviour was like as in we are not customer who they value , they were considering  us like we are begger.

Worst staff I have  ever seen  in any outlets. I will never visit here and urge people to not to entertain such behaviour , instead try other outlets or other icecream centers."
4,Naturals Icecreams are best in taste. The special and best think about the naturals is the season flavours icecreams. Best service little crowded in weekend. Good offers small place but should give nice sittings and soft music and background.

1,"I‚Äôm frustrated with the service I received from Domino's, specifically from the **Nalasopara West** branch. I placed an order Order Number: 74, and not only was it delivered **late**, but the pizza I received was **smaller than what I ordered** and, to top it off, **the food was cold** by the time it arrived!

I‚Äôve already emailed them about this, and it‚Äôs been **18 hours** without a proper resolution‚Äîonly a generic ‚Äúwe're looking into it‚Äù response. I‚Äôve asked for a refund, but no progress yet.

Its a high time to shutdown this outlet"
1,"Ordered chicken pizza today and it is pathetic. We opened the package and had a bite, almost puked. Chicken is smelling so bad and pizza isnt fresh. Anyone will understand it's rotten. Dominos have started serving stale food.
Bohot time se pizza bana kar rajh diya hoga inhone phir order aaya toh wahi kharab, smelling and rotten Chicken pizza customer ko chipka diya.

Why does brand like Dominos started serving such food.  I would advise everyone to check ordered pizza in the presence of delivery guy to ensure that at least it is eatable. Today my celebration was a complete disaster all thanks to Dominos."
4,"It was a good cosy place. There was enough space to move around and children could also roam in that space freely. Pizza was delicious as it goes by the name "" Domino's"".
Areas to work on- The washroom wasn't clean and it was stinking."
1,"An extremely unprofessional..My order was placed over 2 hours ago, and it has still not been delivered.  The app wrongly shows ""Dine-In or takeaway"", while I clearly selected delivery.  Worse, the order was cancelled without my knowledge, and no one from your team informed me.  This isn‚Äôt the first time‚Äîyour delivery is consistently late, and this level of carelessness is unacceptable."
4,I celebrated my birthday with my friends there and I had a great time. The only issue I faced was that the staffs continued to ignore me after I placed my order and I had to call their names dozens of time just to gain their attention.
5,"We had 4 pizza, 2 starters (garlic bread & chicken calzone) Cold drink, everything for 750-800ish rupees only. Great place if you are looking to spend less & eat more.
Desi atmosphere. 10/10 food. Affordable range. Decent well spoken staff."
3,Taste is good but they take too much time to make it.
5,A very budget friendly place and tha test of pizza was amazing üòç
1,I ordered pizza and garlic bread. They brought it very late with no garlic bread and any sauce cheese dip. When I waited for 2 hrs and called they are like rider ne kha liya hoga bich me kuchh nahi kar sakte
5,"I have just tried pizza at pizza bite awesome taste you have to try pizza at budget friendly price and pizza quality is also good and hygienic , service is also good not better ..........."
1,Very bad service the staff doesn't know how to talk hai handle customer they talk very rudely don't purchase cake from here.
1,"Customer service was pathetic and extremely unprofessional. The bakery clerk got offended when we asked them if the pattice was fresh or not, he got extremely extremely offended, being impolite, rude and trying to insult us . When we told them the pattice wasn't good and there was barely any filling he was unable to take criticism and got into passive aggressive behaviour. Never in my life I have ever seen this kind of unprofessional behaviour in my life even in local store. He doesn't even know how to talk to customers. Do better otherwise you are ruining your brand image."
1,"No one buy cake from here they cheap show off they are brand,
Brand shirf naam ka hai inlogo ka cake to cheep quality and bakwas sell krte h staff bhi ek no uneducated logo ko rakhe h in log.

Monginis are very cheap brand....
Shem on you"
1,"This outlet is the worse... Bought pastry of 70rs i gave 100rs staff woman says chutta leke aaoo... I means seriously 30rs chutta nai h .. You guys Should look after this and the pathetic service, u lost one of ur customer"
1,"Very poor treatment to customer , I visited on 12th April 2023 and the service to me giveb was poor by there salesmen . No politeness i was waiting for 15 mins and the sales person was busy talking and quarreling with other customer .
Very Arrogant , I am regular customer"
5,"I have always loved The Maratha Darbar. You have to meet the manager, Aryan Singh. The food is really good and even better if you take Aryan's suggestions. This place also has two halls for private events. Good place overall."
3,"Ambience is 100/100 ,
Chairs don‚Äôt match the ambience,
Food is average I ordered 3/4 items I didn‚Äôt like it much
Singers are great , the sing amazing gazals"
4,"It's a lavish type of restaurant, good interior but still they have to work with their service, food was quite nice."
4,Karaoke here is best. Good place to drink & Listen songs.
1,"Today i ordered food of amt 2600
The person who took my order i have explained him the location the distance between restaurant and my house is hardly 10 to 18min and i have placed the order by 8.30pm i received order by 10.10pm and food was totally cold and really it was waste of my money i want an apology from restaurant owner for the same"
3,Recently I went there the food was delicious but the service was quite slow and I think they needed to focus more on cleanliness as I went there at night so not many people were there but they needed to focus on cleanliness and the washroom was having some bad smell. But overall the food was tasty.
1,"Terrible experience.

----------------------------Update as of 21 May 2025----------------------------
As requested by the Domino‚Äôs outlet owner, I emailed customer service. However, their repeated response has simply been to ask for my order number. I‚Äôve clarified multiple times that I wasn‚Äôt provided a bill‚Äîso how am I expected to have an order number? It feels like I‚Äôm receiving automated replies or responses from someone who isn‚Äôt even reading my emails. This has been an incredibly frustrating experience, and the customer service has been absolutely disappointing. It feels more like a cover-up than actual support.

----------------------------Update as of 11 May 2025----------------------------
Visited this Domino‚Äôs outlet on 30th April 2025 and had one of the worst service experiences ever. The place was dirty, staff were not wearing gloves or head caps, and the person making the pizza wasn't even in Domino‚Äôs uniform.

The pizza itself was awful ‚Äî it was undercooked, cold, and had very few toppings. It honestly felt like I was just eating plain maida.

To make matters worse, I never received a bill for my order. When I returned a few days later, the staff told me to message them on WhatsApp for the bill ‚Äî which never arrived. I even emailed customer care, but there was no response. Completely unprofessional and feels like a scam. Avoid this outlet."
1,"We ordered jalape√±os and pirakira medium size pizza which was soooo sour that we couldn't eat it n left the rest pizza
The store was very dirty.. the floor the door had dirts. The person making pizza was not wearing gloves n head cap and he was cutting cubes of panner in half before putting it on pizza before baking. The ketchup in bottles on tables was rotten üò©.  The pizza delivery bag was kept on dinning tables in seating area.. very badly managed.. will never ever order frm dominos.
I hv pictured too to prove all the above said id true"
1,"You guys don't even deserve the stars. Please shut down your store instead of the worst services given. Pathetic services dominos did not expect this. The order took 1 hour to deliver, 27th April 21:50 order date and time ; 27th April 22:58 delivered date and time, when checked, chat services provided a store number that was switched off, paid, panic and hunger was the situation of your customer. No idea if the order would be delivered to us, because of no contact with the store as well as customer service. Registrated a complaint received a complaint number how ever no calls from customer service. I am still waiting for an answer or a confratation. The delivery guy delivered the pizza stating the manager would handle the situation and have us a number. After the pizzas were delivered neither of them received the calls or responded back to us. The stores and customer services of dominos needs to have some kind of decency when it comes to services and customer satisfaction. Horrible."
1,"My order was placed at 14:01 on 5th May 2025. It‚Äôs 14:57 now my order isn‚Äôt delivered. On the portal is still show order confirmed no side of preparing or out for delivery. The customer service is so stupid to tell me they will get back with a solution in 24 to 48 hours.
The number they provided is switched off.
The number shown on justdail is switched off.. what kind of service is this. Still no trace of the order. After this review we will walk right into you store and see what explanation is to be given on this"
5,"The sports bar- One of the best restaurant in Virar to lit up your evening!ü•≥

If you're searching for a place to go party with your pals or just have drinks while listening to stunning music, this is the place to go.
They feature a large selection of different types of beverages, as well as food to round out the taste and flavour.

The environment is sporty, with a bar area and wooden tables and booths for seating; they even have live music and the venue changes into a dance floor on weekends, which is truly fun.

I had a lot of fun at the live music session, and the atmosphere is also really lively and appealing with the sports theme decor.
The staff and service were excellent, and they even assisted us in selecting a menu from which to choose our favourite items.ü§§

I call customer care and kfc store so many times didn't response any one

Don't Order This location kfc

Very bad experience if some people spend money for Good  food
But we get This kind of service and food

Please respect Customers Values and service we expect from This Big brand

Thank you for this much Tasty food Thank you so much not response anyone
Thank you so much for Everything
#kfc#Dontorder"
5,"KFC lived up to its reputation for serving finger-lickin' good delights. The menu featured a variety of chicken-centric options, from the iconic Original Recipe fried chicken to spicy hot wings and crispy chicken strips. The chicken was flavorful, juicy, and cooked to perfection, showcasing the brand's dedication to quality.

The service at KFC  was efficient, with orders being promptly taken and delivered. The staff was attentive and courteous, ensuring a pleasant dining experience.

It's important to note that KFC can get busy, especially during peak hours or weekends. This might lead to slightly longer wait times, both for seating and food preparation. However, the overall dining experience and quality of the food make it well worth the wait."
1,"We went all the way from virar to eat expecting better quality food as Virar serves worst quality chicken. However, we were sent back saying ONLY CASH payment is accepted. So far worst experience with KFC."
1,Order for spicy zinger burger but instead got the regular zinger burger.
1,Crispy veg burger  ordered  as it was Tuesday. For kid's demand  ordered Burger but it was not  good as before. First time not liked.   Before it was very Nice.
1,"Ah, Burger King, where the AC works, but cooling is optional. If you‚Äôre looking to get that perfect workout while you chow down, this is the place for you! The food is hot, the atmosphere is‚Ä¶ even hotter. It‚Äôs like the universe is telling you, ‚ÄòYou came here for a burger, but you‚Äôre leaving with a sweat session.

Sure, you‚Äôll burn some calories from the heat, but the only thing sizzling here is your skin, not the fries. So, if you‚Äôre looking to eat more and burn fat simultaneously, come on down! It‚Äôs the perfect spot for a post-burger detox just make sure to hydrate, because you‚Äôre basically getting a sauna experience with your Whopper. Five stars for the food, negative five stars for the climate control. You‚Äôve been warned."

1,"Subject: Complaint Regarding Staff Misbehavior

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to formally raise a concern regarding the unprofessional and disrespectful behavior I experienced at your [mention location] outlet on [mention date and approximate time].

During my visit, a staff member [mention name if known or describe them] interacted with me and other customers in a very rude and dismissive manner. The tone used was unacceptable, and instead of addressing our queries politely, the staff appeared irritated and impatient. This not only made the experience uncomfortable but also reflects poorly on the standards I expect from a reputed brand like Belgian Waffle.

I believe in giving feedback where due, and I sincerely hope this matter will be looked into with the seriousness it deserves. Good customer service is essential for retaining customer trust and satisfaction.

I request you to investigate this matter and take appropriate action to ensure such incidents do not happen again in the future.

Thank you for your time and understanding. I look forward to your response."
5,Tried their new Gourmet Waffle series. I must say it was Wow! Must tries are: Almond Fudge Brownie and Death by Choco-rush.
4,Very nice taste

2,"From the Nallasopara West branch, I ordered their Country Special pizza, Medium size. I paid Rs.330/- for it. But the quality wasn't worth the money!
The pizza base, which they claim to make by themselves, was NOT good. Very dry, chewy, and sticky. The borders of the pizza was also dry and I had to throw it away. Pizza base, big flop! üëéThe pizza base sauce, was not sufficient also was less flavourful. So pizza base Sauceüëé
The amount of cheese and vegetables added was okay. Rs.330 ke hisaab se it was less thoughüôÑüòê

But overall experience was NOT SATISFACTORY.

When I called the management, they said I am the only one who gave them a negative feedback. It is possible because Take-away customers usually don't care to give a feedback.
Overall experience, Unsatisfactory and not worth the money."
5,"Just loved it ..the fries were too good seriously we ordered tandoori fries, onion jalapenos pizza, panner tandoori pizza and peri peri fries .... The spices of the flavour were so delicious üòã in taste in near by there was dominos but we wanted to try some new location so tutu's pizza  was best ... atleast in nallasopara I believe it was too good ..so try once... I will surely recommend it"
5,Very good value for money place must visit
5,Pizza bite
1,"I want to give zero star rating, but can't do this because google need atleast 1 star, we ordered triple chicken noodle (without coluur) instead they cooked plain noodle with nothing, very bad taste , very unhygienic for drink water in glass which they are providing glass, washed glass contains detergent, I recommend don't waste your money in such places."
2,I ordered chicken fried rice parcel and the made made for a very long time thinking of me as a child
4,Small place but good food. Not very expensive with taste.

5,
1,As the name suggests it's a normal eatry so cannot expect any fancies. But the least you can expect is a pleasant face and respect. You get a feel that you may not be wanted or why have you come to eat at our place. The staff and owners are very arrogant and non-cooperative in terms of anything and everything. I've had multiple experiences with them and avoid going there unless it's a normal other option. But now I feel I may stay hungry or eat something else other than the looks and the curses.
5,"Tasty food. Veg and Non-Veg, both tasty. Rates are also reasonable. Ample dining space. Liquor is not served. No Smoking zone. Staff is courteous. I will give 10 out of 10 rating for this restaurant."
5,"Egg curry thali is my favorite, home like food. Reasonable cost."
4,One of the best home cooked food in Nallasopara west..if your family is on vacation and there is no one to cook food for few days go to this place they have nice peacefull environment to seat clean and simple thats what i would say and rates are very normal..marathi style homecooked food then this is the place ..u can eat here everyday..dont come here if you wanna party and all it is not that place ..its a home cooked food place

They gave discount for registered customer also so do register.
Overall good to have and must visit."

5,"A Hidden Gem Worth Discovering!

I stumbled upon this Chinese restaurant for the first time with a friend, and since that day, it has become my go-to spot. Unlike many fancy places that charge a bomb but serve just okay-ish food, this place truly stands out with its amazing quality, generous quantity, and reasonable prices.

It‚Äôs like a gem lost in the sand‚Äîfound it randomly on Google Maps, and now I can‚Äôt stop recommending it to everyone. The flavors are authentic, the dishes are consistently delicious, and the experience feels personal and satisfying every single time.

Since it's still a hidden gem, there's no crazy crowd‚Äîyou‚Äôll always find a peaceful seat, and the staff is warm and welcoming. Honestly, places like these deserve all the love and word-of-mouth they can get.

Must visit if you're a true food lover.

Special Thanks to the Owner for making this place affordable and offering Best Food in City."
5,"Very friendly staff very subtle atmosphere feels safe feels like home also the staff agrees to your requirements makes it accordingly to your need & want , I went there with my family we were total 8 people enjyd alot

3,"The food was very very good but the raita and curd onion had extra sugar in it .
With nonveg biryani and curry a side dish with sugar doesn't go well.
Must try caramel pudding."
4,"The food is quite delicious, spacious indoor and outdoor dining.
Staff is quite attentive.

The only issue is less variety in terms of starters , desserts, soft drinks.

Veg food was normal.
In biryani we ordered chicken tikka, mutton and prawns. Chicken biryani was the best.

Chicken tandoori lollipop is a must try.
Chicken crispy quantity was less
Prawns koliwada was just perfect .

Must visit. Just add some more dessert and drinks options."
1,"I‚Äôm extremely disappointed with my experience at BBC today. I ordered the caramel custard, and it was served without any caramel. When I questioned the waiter, they brushed it off, saying that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs supposed to be. As someone who has ordered this dessert many times, I know this isn‚Äôt true.

On top of that, the service was below average. The staff seemed uninterested and unhelpful, and the overall atmosphere felt disorganized. It‚Äôs frustrating to see such a decline in quality, especially for a loyal customer like myself. I left feeling completely let down, and I‚Äôm seriously reconsidering whether to return in the future if things don‚Äôt improve."
5,"Borivali Biryani Center (BBC) in Chikoowadi, Borivali, offers not only some of the best biryanis and Indian dishes but also an inviting atmosphere that elevates the dining experience. The open seating area creates a relaxed, airy vibe, perfect for casual gatherings with friends and family. With warm lighting, comfortable outdoor seating, and a vibrant yet laid-back ambiance, BBC combines great food with an atmosphere that feels welcoming and lively. The aromatic biryanis and flavorful Indian menu options make it a favorite spot for food lovers seeking delicious meals in a cozy, open setting."
5,"We had booked the avenue for our sangeet & engagement function in December 2024. 200 PAX. While our overall experience was amazing, please read the CONS section!

PROS -
- Amazing location, the area was more than big enough for us. The have one small space and one large space divided, as per your need & party size you can choose one or both.
- Decor was on point. They have their own vendor for the same who has monopoly, but Shweta knows her stuff, and will help you achieve the best possible decor in your budget. Totally Trustworthy, just be clear and detailed in your brief and references
- Food - Bang on. Worth every penny, all of our guests mentioned great stuff & compliments about the food, starters and welcome drinks. On request, the starters where circulated for much longer than the usual time as well. The staff service was very well executed too. Kudos to Subhash sir.

CONS -
- The DJ and lights vendor (Sanjay), who they have appointed, and who has monopoly there, was the only thing that didn't work out for us. As our timing were a little extended due to back to back functions the same day, we were asked to pay for 2 shifts for the DJ. Which we agreed on, also extra amounts where paid for stage lightings as well for Dance performances, as they weren't a part of the DJ or Decor Setup.
- Inspite of paying everything in advance to the said vendor, things werent planned properly. We made a pro active effort of providing all music files for the DJ night and performances well in advance, the DJ was totally unprepared and didn't have any files with him, inspite of everything being shared with him a week prior. By God' s Grace, we had a backup plan with backup pendrives, and yet still the DJ managed to screw things up and didnt play the tracks as per the given order or on time.
- There were 6-7 Pendrives given to the DJ by different parties for the sangeet choreographed performances. We got none of them back
- The DJ was not informed that its a double shift, hence he didn't start the soft music sessions on time. We know this because he actually said to us ""Your sangeet and function starts at 6, why do you need music from 4 PM""?. The double shift was booked from 4 PM - 10 PM.
- The vendor (Sanjay)  was very pro active with us, till the payment went to him. Post that, everything was a blunder.
- Of course in our post event feedback we mentioned all of this to the owner. A few days later the said vendor called us on our honeymoon, and had the audacity to say ""Aap mera naam kharab kar rahe ho, maine aapko apna best DJ diya tha"" :/

So overall, i would say this place is lovely, in terms of the food, venue and decor. But if your event is lights and sangeet based, please have proper meetings with the vendor and meet the DJ well in advance, because we still regret not meeting the DJ personally before our event. This is especially important for wedding related events."
3,"We had spinach cannolini which was really good, mushroom risotto which was not bad, could've been a bit more flavourful, and vegetable lasagna which was quite nice! We also ordered a Singapore sling which was good. The ambience, however, was a bit too loud for our liking and the service was really nice."
4,"This is a great place to go if you're looking for a variety of different cuisines all under one roof. The menu features dishes from North Indian,Chinese, continental so there's something for everyone.

The food is all cooked to order, and the portions are generous. I tried the Veg Biryani, which was delicious. The aroma was pleasant and flavorful, and the vegetables was cooked perfectly. I also had the manchow Soup, which was also very good. T

The service at The Avenue is excellent. The staff is friendly and attentive, and they're always happy to make recommendations. The atmosphere is casual and relaxed, making it a great place to go for a casual meal with friends or family.

Overall, I had a great experience at The Avenue. The food is delicious, the service is excellent, and the atmosphere is inviting. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good meal in Kandivali.

* The price range of the restaurant. - 1000 for 2
* The availability of parking - Ample Parking
* Value for Money : 3.5/5"
5,"One of the oldest restaurant in thakur complex. But the quality of food n the taste is same as like years back.
We went there almost after 5 to 7 years but the ambience, the taste of food was the same like before.
Little bit costlier as compared to other restaurants near by but worth it. It's an multi cuisine. Veg n non veg both options available along with hard drinks.
The Mitron pub is also located inside this restaurant on first floor.  Nice place it was .worth visiting their as well."
4,"Had organised our neice's marriage function in the lawns- 500 pax
Good food, attentive service, valet parking!
Just opposite NABARD's officers' quarters."
4,"This was my second time trying a sandwich from subway after almost 3 years. The first time I tried at Thakur Village I liked their sub and the service and so thought of having it again. First of all the time mentioned in google maps for subway is 9 am but the mall opens at 11 am and after reaching there the lady kept me waiting when I went again after 30 mins again she kept me waiting for another 5 mins though I was the only customer and while making my sub she started arranging the bread which I didn't like as she could have completed my order and then manage other things. But the sandwich was nice, though the quantity of veggies and sauce was less as compared to previous time. Giving 4 stars because the lady greeted nicely and I feel the company should train them on how to priortize things. Overall a decent experience and would visit again because they got some nice bread and use fresh veggies. Do try it out. Thank you."
3,"Subway people likes very much as you can have quick bites over here...

They use quality ingredients specially vegetables were very fresh...

They serves veg and non veg items both however there were very less varieties for veg...

They should add more vegetarian options...

We ordered Sub chicken tikka, it was good however I feels that Subway needs to work on improvisation of their menu to make it suitable for Indian taste buds...

Service was fast...

Little costly as it costs me around ‚Çπ 190...

Overall its good for quick bite...

1,"UNHYGIENIC. NOT WORTH A SINGLE PENNY.
I usually don't post reviews but I just couldn't hold myself from this one. I bought myself a sub in the morning on a weekend assuming that it'll have fresh veggies [which they should always have regardless of what time of the day it is] only to realize not only was some of it stale but also unhygienic. Halfway into it and my throat started paining which escalated to cough & cold within no time.
Paid around ‚Çπ250/-  to buy my own sickness, thanks for nothing Subway- Growel's 101."
1,"Ordered a SUB from Zomato. Got it delivered with some other bread and poor stuffing. Called Subway Guy Ajay at Growels, Kandivali East. Got a replay with the straight face stating bread got over and hence, we used another bread. Call Zomato and share photo to them for complaints!

Worst person ever met who does not care at all about the brand and the product! Sorry to know that such people are the face of the company!"
2,Pathetic..the veggies delight did not have any veggies .. they are spoiling subway franchise..subway should take action against them..
1,Mango at this outlet feels only sugar and the cone was also not fresh it not crispy.. was soggy... Would not recommend this outlet ever...
5,"I wanted to eat something sweet after dinner.  And what's better than having ice-cream as a sweet. And when you say ice-cream there's nothing better than Naturals. It was the nearest Naturals outlet near New MHB Colony. Great place and good service.  Staff was also polite and helpful. I tried their classic and best selling Tendor coconut.  And obviously it tasted so good.
Do visit this place if you live near New MHB Borivali West."
4,"Have been visiting this place since quite some time and have to say the quality of their ice creams has never disappointed. They even have nice seasonal varieties, so that one can always find something new to try out here. It has outdoor seating."
1,Delivering less weight 50 grams of scoop against 80 grams as specified. Worst customer relation even after informing the owners 4th time experienced
1,"I ordered 2 Tender Coconut, 2 Coffee Walnut, 2 Chocobite & 1 Roasted Almond & I received 2 Tender Coconut & 5 Coffee Walnut. On top of it, the scoop size was very very small. It was half a scoop & it was spilling in the parcel. If you didn't have the flavors available, why did you accept my order?  What's the solution? Not reliable, cheaters"
5,"This place is located in borivali west nearby railway station. This restaurant is basically famous for its south indian cuisine like having many types of dosa's and idli.
They also serves great punjabi dishes which are just mouth watering.
Place is pocket friendly and good place for small parties.
Staff members are also good.
Few must try dishes:-
Pav bhaji
Tawa masala
Cheese palak dosa
Masala pav
IDLI STICK this are my all time favourites out there....
MUST VISIT!!!
The pav bhaji at Sahara Sagar is so tasty. The bhaji is an example of perfect proportion of various spices and you must top it with onions and coriander! And the soft pav covered with melted butter is just irresistible! Nothing can beat the pav bhaji of Sahara Sagar!"
3,"We visited in Afternoon & order Medu wada Sambhar & Sabudana wada.
Service is good, waiters and clean service is good, just we suggest to serving food is hot, & when we said don't mix wada Sambhar please bring separate then whoever taking orders from customer please listen properly & about Sabudana wada have to cook properly  inside also..
Location is good,
Inside restaurant is good,
Corona protocol taken by owner, all over look good.
They welcome our suggestions..
I like most they served Sabudana wada in banana leaf."
1,"Ordered soup, look in the picture what they sent.
You can have better uttappa and idli, etc here, but can't say the same about north Indian dishes.
Had also ordered dal makhani, was sweet and orange in colour, cannot give it a next try."
5,"Best place for family dinner, it is our to go place if I don't want to cook.. they serve very good  rawa onion dosa, delicious uttapam and crispy sada dosa. Their pav bhaji is a complete 10 on 10. The highlight of the restaurant for us is their yummy royal falooda loaded with dryfruits. Would surely recommend it to everyone."
5,"Pure vegetarian restaurant.

Food : they have a lot of options in North Indian, Chinese and south Indian food.
Their idli vada, dosa and pav bhaji are must try.
Paneer tikka is very tasty, the paneer is very soft and fresh.
Their veg tawa, veg handi and paneer sabzi are a good to try.
Jain options available

Ambience: the place is spacious and divided into three parts, the outdoor seating area, the non a/c indside area which has less tables and the a/c section.
The interior is a little old.

Price and service: even during rush hours they provide fast service, the staff is courteous and helpful.
Menu is pocket friendly and they serve good portion size.

Attributes: there is a little parking space available outside which is usually occupied.
They provide delivery and take away service.
Ideal for family, kids and group.

4,"Nestled within the bustling Growel 101 mall, Cafe Bollywood is a haven for cinephiles. The establishment's unique approach to menu presentation, cleverly infused with witty dialogues, pairs exceptionally well with their delectable offerings, promising an experience that tantalizes both the creative senses and taste buds.

During my visit, I opted for the Kachori Plate, a delightful choice that did not disappoint. Each Kachori was a burst of flavor, perfectly complemented by the accompanying chutneys, curd, and namkeen. To my delight, Cafe Bollywood was participating in the Thoosday offer, affording a generous 40% discount on food every Tuesday and Thursday, making it not only a culinary treat but also wallet-friendly."
4,"We are visiting for last 10 years and one thing stands out is the consistent taste of items.
Their menu is spread out however the best ones are
Veg Grill Sandwich
Veg Manchow Soup
Chole Bhatura"
3,"As name says this outlet had bollywood theme interior...

They have wide varieties of dishes, specially chaat, pav bhaji, paratha, chole bhature, pizza, Chinese, cold drinks etc...

A unique thing I found while ordering...When you order anything they give you 1 gadget with LED's, when your order is ready that gadget starts vibrating and LED's starts blinking... Its easy for them to inform the customer and convenient for customer to know that their order is ready...fantastic...

I ordered below items -

Chole samosa chaat - It was delicious...chole was tasty and well cooked, samosa was good too on top of that chutneys, curd and namkeen...

Chole pattice - This was tasty too... crispy shallow fried pattice with chole, chutney and curd...

Paneer chilly - This dish was not good, it seems paneer was old, it was hard...avoid it...

Overall it was a ok...

On jain food they put onion also and say sorry to customer..
Very third call altitude and service .
Never suggest any one for CAFE BOLLYWOOD"
1,Yesterday i had ordered this triple rice and i got this in my plate a ‚Äòstone‚Äô.very disgusting never suggest this place to anyone.shut your shop as soon as beg on street.
3,If you want to try Chinese must visit here. For veg items not much good. Place is not enough hygienic. Waiter doesn't use hand gloves. If you are visiting here try chicken lollipop and Schezwan chutney definitely. Chicken tandoori is also good. Chicken biryani was ok ok. AC and Non- Ac both seating available. For birthday celebration you can book here. Price of each item is budget friendly as compared to other restaurants.
1,"I ordered chicken fried rice and see what i got.. horrible, terrible. they added egg in this only"

Food was really good.
I would recommend the murg Dil kush kebab which had stuffing of grated cheese. It was very delicious. The vodka based cocktail with orange & peach was quite refreshing too."
5,"A hidden gem.

A local bar and restaurant which I must say has the most decent crowd you‚Äôll ever find in any bars, always brimming with people and serving mouth watering food both vegetarian & non vegetarian along with alcohol.

Absolutely love their dal khichdi, it‚Äôs one of the best that they have in this region. Their egg tawa and egg lemon coriander soup is also mind blowing, didn‚Äôt expect such flavour bomb explosions. For starters they have a variety of veg & non veg snacks of which cheese chaska kebab is a must try which is ideally potato & cheese nuggets pan fried in shape of kebabs. Apart from this, the golden fingers too are worth a try, it‚Äôs a bread based starter which has veggies as toppings then crusted with seasame seeds and deep fried, a very crispy & indulgent snack that goes amazingly well with your drinks. Do try their house special chakna which is chakli with hot schezwan sauce, ab absolute childhood favourite.

As for drinks, they mostly have all the brands available, love their cocktails too, tried the mojito and boy was it amazing! The best part though is all the chakna around here that comes with the alcohol, they sure do spoil you with choices & service.

All in all, as much skeptical I was to enter this place at first, now it‚Äôs a go to place to catch up with friends on weekends when in Bombay!

P.S: they‚Äôre open until 1.30 am"
5,"La Classique has always been my favourite restaurant for local food. This place has some delicious North Indian food. Very decently price. The place is generally overcrowded. So we thought of ordering the food at home. We ordered Chand sitara and Maharani dal.
Chand Sitara - thet serve in red gravy and the koftas are made up of palak and paneer which make this sabji more delicious. This is my all time favourite sabji.
Maharani dal - In maharani dal, all the ingredients were in right proportion. It had a perfect taste. I could feel the taste of all the ingredients. I'm a fan of dal.
This is one of my favourite place."
4,"Super chill place to hang out with friends. They don‚Äôt play music so one can actually talk to the people on their table!
Mostly just had starters and they were great - quantity with quality."
5,The place has a decent ambiance. The bar options are good. The food is amazing and a variety of options for both veg and non-veg. Specially the non-veg dishes are worth trying. Food and drinks both have been rightly priced. Staff is good in their recommendations. Basically a place to catch with your friends. Must try.. :)
1,"Worst worst worst. I come to my hometown for 2 weeks in a year and love eating dhoklas and Chinese samosa. You walk in to this store of a Saturday morning, eyes fall on Chinese samosa and coconut patice. I gently asked are they fresh at 8.45am? .. Haan abhi nikala hai 5 mins pehle. You pack them take home to eat. Bang!!.. stale. Not edible at all.. after this it made me realise why a store will not give you a bill for products purchased worth 975. You are able to scan the products and see the total amount but can't print the bill... ? Naa hoga print Naa hoga proof of sale. Was it because she knew product she sold today are not fresh ? Who cares, this was my last visit.."
1,Went to buy sweets the other day.. when checking on the ladoos saw a cockroach running around them.. when i bought it to their notice the staff simply took the tray out and removed it.. did not even have the courtesy to apologise and on top asking if want to buy sweets from them.. never ever will buy after this.
1,I ordered Ghewar from this shop by Zomato after watching ratings but when it came & served to my guest there was an Rat‚Äôs sheet in it just ridiculous & insulting moment in front of guest they are not hygienic very bad & already complained them regarding same‚Ä¶
4,"One of the best places in Borivali for fafda, jalebi, and mohanthal.
They offer a variety of sweets, pre-packed snacks, and fresh snacks like samosas and dhokla."
3,Good Indian sweets. They have a very huge variety. The products are very good. The place is very clean and higeny. We always buy sweets from here.
5,Very good collection and very sweet and welcoming lady ‚ù§Ô∏è
5,Very helpful owner. Always ready to guide and amazing variety. Thank you for amazing service too
5,Very nice collection... Whatever shown was apt and perfect to buy... did not have to find a needle out of haystack... very polite and courteous behaviour.. loved the experience of shopping here...
5,Best and Latest collection of Ladies wear you can get.  My wife's favorite shopping destination. Here they actually focus on quality .
5,"Ekta is really cooperative, and Ixora legit saved my photoshoot by providing me goods at the last moment!!

Good quality, good collection....go for it !"
4,"Liked the AC section upstairs good food tasty and spicy, liked the chakna a long with the drinks. Quite pocket friendly menu. Good for fine dine and there is separate section only for family dining. comfortable sitting peaceful polite staff. Sezwan rice and egg Rice is good in quantity. Famous for chicken lollipop and pullav."
2,"The food was average, nothing very exquisite of that sort and the staff was very nonchalant. The thing that bugged me the most was they were selling packaged drinks at more than mrp. This is a really bad practice and to some extent illegal if I may. There's a reason it's called MAXIMUM RETAIL PRICE. Very disappointing."
1,Very bad restaurant in the mumbai n very high price n very bad language used to owner restaurant n staff is very rudly talk to u  n this is resturant is very bad food in mumbai n very bad language used n there is food quality is very bad n poor
4,Our family has mostly been to this resto for having nonveg.. For chicken lovers  must try chicken adraki..just awesome.We try here all time basic food chicken rara paneer mushroom butter roti. Overall they have separate space for family only 1st floor
4,"1. Goan Fish is just superb. Visited this place and ordered it at home too..Tastes great. I think this is their best dish.
2. Even the fish fry was awesome. Cooked in Mangalorian/ Maharashtrian style.
3. Prawns was not prepared properly.
4. Place is ok for dine in. Not meant for family visit.
5. Bar is good.
6. Rates are reasonable."
5,Simple joint but the food is very good. Though small this place is very hygienic. Try their simple grill sandwich or even their Bhel. They taste great. Also this place does not go as crowded as Mahavir Nagar. It‚Äôs a bit around 2 KM from the railway station but easily accessible by auto
3,Good place for snacks and fresh stuff. Sandwich and Pani Puri is best. You get proper sitting to have your snack.
3,"Bangalore Iyengar is the largest chain of pure vegetarian bakery in Mumbai. Well known for its dry cakes available in different varieties like rava cake, vine cake, plum cake etc.Their other items like pastries and cream rolls are also worth trying out. The best part about their items is freshness, quality and all veg. BIB is not an excellent one compared to the high standards of bakeries in Mumbai but still it is a good one."
5,"Best quick bites option in kandivali east near station. Affordable prices amd varity of food options. Also offers home delivery.
Please see attached menu card and contact details"
3,"A small joint on the corner of the road. We six friends decided to have food there. While I thought it's only a chat corner, the menu is quite long and has South Indian items also.
Pani puri was not good. Puris lacked the crunch. There were stale. The paani of paani puri was medium. There are better paani puris available else where.
Sandwiches were good. Sevpuri was ordinary.
The eating place is right on the flowing road. So be prepared to get some dust and smoke while you eat"
3,"Food :- The food overall is good, would give it a 6 out of 10. Good for a quick bite or a budget dinner. A number of dishes options.

Sitting :- Also the place is good but the outdoor sitting is pretty congested.

Service :- The service is not that great. Very slow service and the management is bad and unorganized.

Atmosphere :- A noisy atmosphere, not recommended for peaceful dinning, only recommended for group dinning."
5,One of my favourite restaurant best for Chinese don't miss the Manchurian helping staff n food is just mind blowing not so expensive n u will also love the quality n quantity of food n also try panner chilly n garlic bread ‚ù§Ô∏è I was so excited to eat noodles n rice so I don't click the picture but u must try it u r just gonna love it üòò
4,One of the best Chinese in the area.
5,"I know Radha Krishna is known for its chinese but guess what i tried, i tried china gate pizza. The only amazing chinese pizza which i really like it. Quite a good size and filler too. It has fried noodles with good amount of veggies. It costs 250rs. Its on zomato.
Please so try it."
4,"Perfect place for perfect Chinese food...
The restaurant is specialised in serving Chinese food. This restaurant is in Mahavir Nagar, Kandivali West. Ambience is not so good, they can improve that. I ordered triple shezwan rice. Price is also not less or not that high as compared to others. We can't complain about quality or quantity of food.
Good restaurant and food taste superb!!"
5,Great cakes ...Good service ..fresh pizza and puff...bought stuff from here multiple times. They do delivery as well with additional delivery charges
1,"This outlet is very bad,staffs are untrained,the stuffs are not good.Today I have went for takin pastries( Brownie Pastry and Red Velvet Pastry) and choco lava. What to say about taste it's horrible. Red Velvet has no cream filling and Choco Lava has damaged. It was stinking. Pastry was tasteless.You cannot be able to get pastry for your child because you cannot be assure about quality it may turn into food poisoning.Pastry display itself looks so tacky.Staffs are very rude  and shop keep stinking. This outlet has spoiled the name and goodwill of Monginis.SV Road and Borivali outlets provide good service. Tasteless food. Not worth spend a single penny over here and don't run just in the name of Monginis. In short this outlet has spoiled the name of Monginis."
5,"My favourite cake store.
I love their pastries so as pizzas and puff.
Black forest is my favourite.
I also love zebra torte.
For family birthdays we mostly order cake from mongenis.
Their Oreo cake is also nice.
Potato shells are so good to eat with cake.
Better than potato chips

Tatse:5/5

Now the backing box has handle to carry which is the best part.
Environment friendly and not to carry any bag from home"
1,"Just bought 2 pastries from this place, Stale hard like wood, no spoons given, staff behaviour was rude the pack it in monginis pastry box and hand ove to you without any bag.

Worst"
5,It's always fun to be around in the shop.. been coming here since 15 yrs and the products doesn't fail to impress.
4,Different types of Dosa are their USP. They equally have pav bhaji and Parathas. The quantity is very good and the taste is also good.
5,Good quality Dosa at best price. Nice taste
1,Very bad service plz don't come in this hotel waiter see in customer face
3,Quantity was too much but taste was ok
4,Nice food
5,"This is a place serving relishing chaat dishes in Kandivali khaki galli. We tried their Pani Puri. They had an option for Ragha or sprouts in Pani Puri.

We had it with Ragda and enjoyed it thoroughly. The Pani too seemed to be fresh. Well they also had other chaat dishes like samosa chaat, bhel puri, sev puri and different types of sandwiches.

A good place to binge on some evening snacks."
5,"Amazing place!! I had almost everything from shree ram the above pics are of Cheese Grill Sandwich which is of 135 rs and let me tell you it's best sandwich in Mahavir Nagar, also veg patties were awesome in taste. I visited lots of branches of shree ram. I loved this branch the most. Taste of the snacks of this branch is best. I also love having chaat. Sweets are awesome in taste. Staff is good. No long waiting. It's crowded but service is good. Price is little bit high but it gets reciprocate because of the taste. And the most important thing is it's very hygienic place. Everyone out here wears gloves. Has lots of variety in menu. Must visit...."
5,"Quality traditional sweets for all festivities, occasions and gifting
Flavor and hygiene levels 10/10
Great packaging
Superb chaat corner
All varieties of snacks available"
5,"10/10
CHEESE Grill Sandwich must try
Fantastic food quality
Amul butter, govardhan cheese and peanut oil .
Expensive but food is top notch . Because I don't compromise on Excellent quality food . For saving some pennis"
5,"Must-try items like Chole Samosa, Ragda Samosa, Dahi Kachori, Dahi Puri, and Somasa promise bursts of flavor with each bite. The sweets are heavenly, catering perfectly to those with a sweet tooth."
5,"Food is really good, taste as well as quantity. No extra seating charges for booze. Rates are normal not much expensive. 1000/- for 3 people including starters and main course."
1,Most worst service ever this restaurant Don't provide order food properly also I told him to deliver chicken tandoori with pahadi flavour bt he has send chicken tikka boneless with padhai flavour and not ready to replace the food . Worst service I got everything from this restaurant
4,"A good experience...Butter chicken was Good..has lot of small chicken pieces... gravy was good...

Chicken Dum Biryani was above average..it had 2 piece... quantity was good for 2 people...
Butter Nan was good..."
1,Most & most worst service ever this restaurant.. They don't even come to take food order quickly and they don't pay attention to customers... Don't go there .. worst restaurant...
4,The food is awesome here. Ambience and Service is not so good
1,"Staff is uneducated can't even make simple Cheese Franky ? He is confirming me more than 3 times, Total money waste, only cabbage sauce and potato stuffed with some of cheese. Bass itna hi hota he ? Malasa &  salt left the chat, no taste.

Please improve your taste maintain good hygiene you are damn opposite kandivali railway station, or else you close your shop you don't have any right to play with someone's health"
1,"Worst food. Stale potatoes in sev puri, samosa chutney was also stale.
People will definitely fall ill.

Should surely complain to fssai and bmc."
3,"Its a Mithai and sweet shop which server other snacks like Vada pao , bhaji pao , dabeli, and lassi as well. Food is okay although they don‚Äôt serve food with a smile . After visiting there couple of time I find their behaviour is little rude. Maybe the have lots of stress .. but who doesn‚Äôt. It wouldn‚Äôt kill them to be a little polite and ‚ÄúSweet‚Äù with the costumers."
1,"Worst experience ever. If I could I would give minus rates. The receptionist and serving guy are so rude. The receptionist was busy arguing with one of the employees that he didn't give me change also. Even the server was refusing to give chutney parcel with kachori and was so arrogant in responding.
And becoz of that I had to buy samosas..which were so pathetic, as if they had reheated them a third time or something. Even the chutney he gave with samosa felt stale...it was smelling sour and was even worse to taste as if it was days old. Ruined my mood altogether üò§"
1,"First, the service was slow and unorganized. I waited a long time for my order, and when I finally received it, the Vada Pav was lukewarm and lacked the signature flavors I expected.

The cleanliness of the place was also concerning; the tables were sticky, and the overall environment felt uninviting."
4,"Ordered takeaway through Zomato (limited stuff) Review purely based on what I'd ordered.
Ordered the chicken and tenderloin potato chops that were really good. Was expecting more meat in the goan sausage fry though.
Would love to visit the restaurant in person to sample other fare on their menu."
5,"Its a really amazing place with great view and soothing ambience. Food is also tasty, a must try for all the goan and mangalorean cuisine lovers. For the sweet dish, bebinka with icecream and chocolate sauce üíØü§åüèªüî•"
5,"Amazing food and they name stands for the service...lovely food ,staff assistance on point"
3,"I had a friend fly down for a surprise visit and I wanted to take him for a dinner of dosas and mangalorean curries and upon searching these keywords on Google,Mangoes showed up and on a whim I decided to host my guest for dinner here. I have stayed in Malad for years now and never knew a rooftop restro existed here which served mangalorean dishes so I had high expectations.
This was 9pm on a Saturday. The ambience was nice and a welcome change from the noise and hustle of Bombay,it's on the top floor of the same building which houses Sahu eye hospital.
We got seated easily,it wasn't too crowded. The first bummer:There were no dosas on the menu. Second the menu was heavy on non veg items and my friend being a vegetarian our options were limited. We wanted to start off with some veg cutlets but they didn't have it. The server suggested panner chilli which we ordered in.
The biggest sore point-the service! It took them 45m to get the starter plus there were literally no servers on the floor,one of them made an appearance when some far off seated customer whistled but he rushed back immediately in the kitchen as well. ASA the starter arrived we ordered for jeera rice and dal with some paneer gravy and the server informed us that would take 30m min to arrive. We had reached the establishment at 830 and until 1000 we waited for the main course. There was a TV playing a match and the crowd was a bunch of families.
From the ambience I had high expectations but the service was very poor and the food was average though the pricing was decent."
5,"I recently found out about this place 2 months ago. Being a malad native this is Great!! Amazing food, real attention to quality and sourcing. perfect pricing. been my lunch or dinner for the last month. Mangoes, You're killing it, stay the same. stay hard!"
5,"I ate Jumbo King Burger for the first time after years and absolutely loved it!!!

Actually I went to this outlet because I wanted to eat Jumbo King Vada Pav but than I got to know that Jumbo King no longer sells Vada Pav and that left me heart broken because I loved their Vada Pav any ways after giving it a thought for a while I decided to go and buy burgers instead and hence took a meal parceled home.

I absolutely loved their burger and fries, their patty was crispy and had good amount of vegetables and the cheese was filling as well also their french fries are Crispy.

Higly Recommend Jumbo King üíö‚ù§Ô∏èüôè"
5,"Ordered last night from here - and it was pretty neat for a 2am delivery. Absolutely loved the taste of Big Crunch burger - it had enough dressing and patty to have with pav, and the peri peri French fries were also pretty awesome - not too soggy and loaded with cheese"
1,Idk who was he the owner he is little bald and pale white skin he was soo rude like very rude some people were sitting eating there the taklu was like aap jaao na agee like seriously??? Then why the sitting arrangement is there lol I want this shop toh be close Orr the taklu toh get retire or quit his job
5,"Got burgers from my favourite college time outlet Jumboking. Love their burgers and the grilled classic JK. Tried some of their best burgers. Checkout below!

Mumbai Burger
Love this burger. The classic veggie patty with mayo and veggies is a treat to anyone. All time favourite!

Big Crunch JK
I loved it as it gives you the crunchyness, plus the use of jalepeno/chilli mayo makes it give the zingy and spicy taste with an amazing patty filling.

Classic Cheese Burst
This literally gives the cheese burst as a complete slab of cheese is fried as a patty. The cabbage and tomatoes and mayo give it some juicyness and you will love it if you love cheese.

Crispy Veg
The patty was crispy with the classy veggie filling. The mayo, tomatoes and other veggies make it a prrfect combo.

Oreo Shake
I loved it. I never knew they served one but this is definitely going to be ordered again by me. Its a must order"

The shakes were nice fresh, creamy!! delicious!! Great taste!! Yummiest drinks!!
Just one shake was not enough..
Want to try all other shakes as well..

I would recommend this place..."
5,"The ambience is nothing great but they offer great service.
Also the Nutella milkshake available here is the best I have ever tasted. Plus the orange mint is a great and a very different flavour."
5,*HAPPY SHAKES TIME* a place where you can actuallyfind a true blend of milk shakes. Just took mine Brownie shake and it was literally yummilicious !! Though it was my first experience with Happy Shakes Time but it was literally amazing!!!
5,Place is small but shakes are ultimate in taste and service is also very nice. Polite staff. I have tried Brownie shake and it was too yumm... I suggest everyone to visit
4,"I recently visited a McDonald's outlet, and honestly, it was not a great experience. The service was quite disappointing‚Äîthere was a long wait time even though it wasn‚Äôt very busy. The staff seemed disinterested and not very helpful.
Overall, I expected better, especially from a well-known brand like McDonald's. They really need to work on improving both their service and the environment."
1,"Staff was not at all help full
I requesting to them  I'm  alone I'm not stay a
@ Kandiwali I m staying in dadar unfortunately I have to wait her because off out side are people are not good that's way
There clear ly said that we don't know about this you can stand out side you go at Rellway station. I just said to them I setting only for 30mi  after that I go
Then never listen me said no you can't wait her
Outside it's too much of a dark area and I requested ankit  he said that he was the manager I literally requested them  after 30 minutes I go
Not listening at all  I'm not playing any woman card but when I said clearly to them that I'm not comfortable outside I have to come there  for my work  very very bad really not happy with this place  time is / 11:45"
1,"I visited this store in Kandivali West opp station. It took 20 minutes to only prepare an mc veggie order. Is this justified? Does that take this longer for simple regular meal. Also I expected it to be hot against the time taken to deliver, however it was moderate.  This is really disappointing"
1,"Always have ordered üçîüçüü•§üßã McVeggie Combo meals, the app has FAILED EVERYTIME for atleast 10 Meals Order since May 2024!
McD should take into account but they don't help

Go for Medium size as you get bigger Mcveggie burger, bigger Soft drink/Coke or Fanta float,
Not French Fries they are tiny pieces compared to small meal, although more in quantity Don't go if you like French fries, doesn't tastes as good as one'd expect.

the Corn and cheese burger üßÄ alongwith drinks option is not worth the hype, at all!

A least one among three kiosk machine in every McD I've been to doesn't works, including this one.

Internet and network is terrible here. Internet could not even start at all.

Service is cordial, helpful, hard working, SLOW SOME TIMES but other places they are trained the same.

Here they absolutely, by themself, Don't tell you about good offers.

Take away bag Breaks before you reach your destination and fries are not packed well.
The staff approached me to tell that the Fries are packed with tissues placed upon them.
Fries didn't taste good, bag and other products were not smudged with oil

But still Packing is such, that the Fries looses it's entire taste, bland and unsalted.

Also the bottle is so tightly closed that it did Not open until the meal was eaten and the drink wasn't cold.

This franchisee, unlike others, doesn't advices against the float/icecream bcuz here it Isn't Already melted when served.

Too much ice in drinks, tastes like water. Bottle has the option NOT TO BE CLOSED FULLY TIGHT YET THE DRINK DOESN'T LEAK.
PLEASE DON'T WAIT FOR CUSTOMER TO ASK SO, JUST DO IT!

AS WHEN THE BOTTLE IS FULLY CLOSED,
IT'S SO TIGHT THAT IT WON'T OPEN UNTIL IT BECOMES WARM.

Milk üçº shake option is not worth going for.
Doesn't tastes good. COMBO MEALS WITH MILKSHAKE ü•∫

The camaraderie was special, and the memories have stuck with me. Our bill of 2000-2500 rupees for 7 of us was a bonus ‚Äì affordable and enjoyable. Looking back, I'm grateful for those moments with friends."

1,"When you go after 10.30 pm, when you order Punjabi thali, the taste of two dishes is same, like dishes like paneer and veg kolapuri have same masala and veg pulao is also of very low quality, One day when I ate Punjabi thali I had parceled the food from my thali. I had parceled Daal and Veg Pulao rice in the parcel. When I took the Pulao home and opened the parcel, it had a foul smell. Next time I told them about the hotel but they denied it."
3,"‚Ä¢ Ordered ""Gadbad"" Icecream (Three scoops of icecream with fruits, jelly & dry fruits) & Dahi Wada.
‚Ä¢ Good taste but the service ruined our experience.
‚Ä¢ From entering the restaurant to getting our order it took half an hour for such miniscule order because:
1) The waiter was clueless on what the menu items contain,
2) No other assistance to him from other staff,
3) Assistant manager is also reluctant to take the order with some modifications."
5,"The food was absolutely delicious. The service at Kushal Restaurant was excellent! The staff was polite and attentive, going above and beyond to provide a wonderful eating experience""."
4,"As I was travelling from station and saw this place nearby decided to have something here as I was very hungry .
I went  there and I have Chicken triple rice . The ordered took very less time to come . The quantity and quality of the food was very nice.
Staff was very polite and humble.
But the hotel needs a lot of improvement and they should work on their infrastructure and all as it looks dirty . And in night it doesn't look good"
5,"It's a super Mumbai vibe local bar and restaurant with okay management and good food. As a group of friends who catch up at the same spot for almost 7 years now, the place speaks our tones. Don't expect clean things, superb service and the hospitality you're oh so used to. It's a local bar so the stakes are pretty low."
4,"I never go for drink. I loved the Butter Chicken. Its one of the best better chick they have in Mumbai Suburban.

Chinese food is not good as Tandoori They also have A/c section for Family."
4,"One of the tastiest Biryani I had in my entire life!
I was hungry and there was nothing around except for this Bar and Restaurant. I went there and asked if they serve Biryani and if it's boneless to which they said yes and I got this flavourful rice with similar flavour juicy pieces of boneless chicken and I told them that they really made my day..
There was a TV playing cricket matches, people drinking and all but no noise at all.
Waiters and attendents were nice.
They do accept card payments.
There is no wheelchair accessible entry.
Easily noticable from the main road near the railway station.
Worth your visit for Biryani!"
3,The food was ok. It wasn't spicy. The only thing that missed was proper hygiene. The taste was good compared to the price. You may find aggressive and irritating people serving you. The owner also behaves rude. Parking facility is not provided. You have to take care of it.
5,Reasonable and good food. Small place so prefer home delivery. Pav bhaji and Hakka Noodles are must try.
1,"Average
Very silent place, no visitors, no waiters, no greetings by the restaurant.
The food is average too. Not at all good for chinese."
5,Try their fried misal..! Old joint in Kandivali with options of quick bites...
5,It has yummy Jain Chinese and Pav Bhaji.
3,You get only bhel and sevpuri it's ok type...I have eaten at better places
5,It is very spicy.

5,"Discovered this mall recently, and it turned out to be one of the best with its classic and quaint infrastructure. The presence of numerous kiosks adds vibrancy and a sense of liveliness. What stands out are the beautiful pillars that replace the typical glass facades, giving the mall a more pleasant and appealing aesthetic.

Though several shops display ""coming soon"" boards, their opening should significantly boost footfall. The food court offers a decent variety of options. The best way to reach the mall is via the Poisar Metro Station. Parking is ample for both two-wheelers and four-wheelers."
4,"Today I visited the mall and had a great experience.
The ambiance was clean, spacious, and well-maintained.
There was a wide variety of stores offering great collections.
I enjoyed browsing through fashion, electronics, and lifestyle outlets.
The food court had multiple options and the food was tasty.
Staff across shops were polite and helpful.
Parking was hassle-free and well-organized.
The mall also had good entertainment options like a cinema and gaming zone.
It was a perfect place to spend quality time with friends/family."
4,"This is a great mall, conveniently located near the WE Highway in Kandivali. The architecture is elegant with a nice rounded design, and it offers a wide range of brands for shoppers. The washrooms are clean and well-maintained. There is also a spacious food court that can accommodate plenty of people, which offers all the major food joints and coffee shops. The mall has PVR multiplex for the viewing experience. Additionally, there are plenty of play areas for toddlers & kids, some good news for parents. It has an open parking area for 2 W & 4 W. Overall, it's a good mall."
4,"I recently visited Growels Mall in Kandivali, and I must say it's a great destination for shopping, dining, and entertainment.
1. Variety of stores: Growels Mall has a wide range of stores, from high-end fashion brands to affordable options. You'll find something for everyone.
2. Dining options: The mall has a great food court with a variety of cuisines, from Indian to Italian. There are also several restaurants and cafes.
3. Entertainment: The mall has a cinema hall, gaming zone, and kids' play area, making it a great destination for families.
4. Cleanliness and maintenance: The mall is well-maintained and clean.
Overall:
Growels Mall is a great destination for shopping, dining, and entertainment. While it can get crowded on weekends, the variety of stores and dining options make it a worthwhile visit. I would recommend visiting during weekdays for a more relaxed experience.

5,"Malgudi in Kandivali East is a hidden gem for South Indian food lovers, especially if you visit on a Tuesday when they have a fantastic Buy One Get One Free offer. The experience here is a treat, both in terms of flavors and value for money.

The Benne Podi Dosa was a highlight, with its crisp texture and a generous coating of podi masala that added the perfect spice kick. The Pav Bhaji Dosa was an interesting fusion, blending the buttery flavors of Mumbai‚Äôs favorite street food with the crunch of a dosa. The Appam with Malabar Curry was soft and fluffy, pairing beautifully with the mildly spiced curry. The Ghee Podi Thatte Idli was another standout‚Äîsuper soft and soaked in ghee, making it a melt-in-the-mouth delight. To top it all off, the Masala Chai was the perfect warm and aromatic end to the meal.

If you‚Äôre a fan of authentic South Indian flavors with a twist, Malgudi is a must-visit. Make sure to go on a Tuesday to make the most of their BOGO offer, which makes the meal even more satisfying!"
5,"If you craving for an authentic south indian food then ""Malgudi"" is a best place for you to dine. I have seen their outlets in almost every food court. The taste is too good and the quality what they serve is absolutely freshly prepared. The prices are also affordable and the quantity is good comparatively with the price."
5,"Love the food here, been a fan for years now. They have recently introduced benne dosa as a part of their menu and we honestly loved it We also tried their Malgudi Special Pav Bhaji and Paper Masala Dosa which they made it crisper on my request and also tried their steamed idli it‚Äôs affordable tasty and pocket friendly Ravi who was at the counter was also really sweet"

5,"Good Food. Variety of options available for vegetarians. Pizza cone, Pav Bhaji fondue, Bamboo rice etc., are some different items that are not available everywhere. Cocktail menu is great and the prices are reasonable as well. Music is good and one can watch cricket also. Good crowd and highly recommended for vegetarians."
5,"One of the rare vegetarian restrobar in Mumbai.

Pros:

The cost was moderate. It will be approx 800- 1500 for a couple based on the drinks they take. If you take alcohol it will be more.

The ambiance was very great. Light music and well lit areas.

Service was slightly slow but it was clear that their chef was making fresh preparation and garnishing was worth the wait.

Finally and importantly the taste of food was good but qty is on the higher side due to which one should be cautious about the number of people going to consume a dish.

Huge number of vegetarian options which are difficult to find in other restaurants.

Cons:

More cleanliness of the staircase  and downstairs will be more pleasant.

Over a very pleasant visit."
4,"The ambience is chill. Had exotic salad 4/5
Sizzler 4/5, Panner starter 3/5, fries are nice but thick n lil spicy 4/5.
I tried a unique soup which had coconut flavor and tasted nice after mixing all ingredients.
The place is good to visit. They have live music on the 1st floor. They have a baby chair.
Overall food was good.
Budget ‚Çπ‚Çπ‚Çπ not so reasonable place.
Ambience 4/5
Quality 5/5
Quantity 4/5
Staff are friendly."
4,"Very tasty food. The ambience is also good with sober lighting. Thete is various types of cuisines.

A point I would like to add is that the service is not so good. The service takes a lot of time ."
3,So we've been here more than twice. Initially this place was way amazing in terms of food taste and ambience and hygiene. Now i feel the taste has been compromised a little. Recently we went there and ordered Schezwan fingers which was not upto fiscos mark. Post that we ordered jackie chan sizzler which was chinese based sizzler. Tasted okaish. For beverages they have offer on tuborg silver and heniken as it's introduced new to the market 2+1. For mocktail we ordered crazy girls which tasted like kala khatta gola in juhu beach. Will not recommend at all with this mocktail. Service is above par no doubt. Mr Naitra along with his staff were quite polite and humble.
3,"Village ‚Äì the soul of India is amazing place to hang out with families & organizing birthday parties. People can eat variety of chat items, mains, drinks, desserts around more than 55 items.. nice place for foodies. Food quality is not so good like 4 star restaurants but spending 2-3 hours with families here it totally worth it!!"
5,"I really liked the concept of having an all veg Buffet which would include all cuisines from different parts of India. Plus the ambience and overall vibe over here is desi and small things such as katputli dance, small one minute flok dance, chai over cycle, etc makes the dining experience even better. I even loved the service here as the waiter was friendly and very courteous."
5,"So we had already visited the outlet of raghuleela mall, and results makes us reach here . Entrance was a typical Village theme. The ambiance is worth while and the likes and rappering makes it look very beautiful. There were variety of stalls named with the typical names. It all started with welcome drink and then we moved ahead with starters and then it all went in flow . There was variety of food to experience. The chef too is Keen to serve us. The service seems upto mark. The gujrati Garba songs , Astro , tarot card, everything and don't forget the popet show. This refreshed our minds and made it look awesome. So guys its a must visit place go enjoy with your family and friends.we would blioe to name the chefs and staff services for making our evening beautiful and served us a bariy of food.chef:- Banwari, Management:- Ashwin. The man behind best service:- Sanjay Bhai.
Worth the penny here. And experience the best indian culture theme."
3,"If you are looking for decent vegetarian Indian food buffet, you will probably like this place.  They do have few ""non indian"" cusines like noodles, one Chinese gravy, momos, mini pizzas etc in the buffet menu, but they are very passable. It's the Indian food, esp.north India food that you should focus on. The starters were good. Only a few things in main course were tasty, everything else was mediocre. Was disappointed with limited choice of beverages - only chaas (buttermilk) and jal jeera. Few other options like fresh lime soda/water would have been great. There were 5-6 dessert options - focus on fresh made desserts like kheer, halwa and avoid sweets.  They have  tried hard to give a village feeling in the ambience but clearly haven't succeeded. When you think of village decor the walls, furniture, utensils everything should reflect that.  Placing a few rural decor articles here and there doesn't do the justice. Overall the experience was fine, but I know better veg buffet places at lower costs, so I might not try this place again."
3,"Village ‚Äì The Soul Of India the place is exactly how the name is from the food till its Ambiance the place gives a vibe of an Traditional Indian Village more concentration towards the Rajasthani Style. The Place is quite Big and Enjoyable cause of the things to do over there besides eating. The have a Live puppet show on the stage overlooking the entire crowd, They also have a live Gola Stand ( ICE Stick ) along with a Tattoo Studio. They also have a different options of Seating too, like the Broken Car sitting, Tent Style sitting, A dance floor and a few more options too.

Coming to the Food section This restaurant is purely a Buffet style Restaurant where in they serve you different types of starters at your table as many time you want but for the Main course and Sweet-dish you have to go to the Self-serving counter.

Among the starters I had tried 3 different types. The first was the Tandoori Aloo, an age old dish prepared with the spicy marination cooked over a Charcoal tandoor. The dish was nice with a burnt outer layer coving the soft mini potatoes. It was a good preparation but lacked a little bit of the taste in the spiciness, Still it was a delight to have it.

Second Dish was the Dhai Chat again an old dish in the Chat industry. This was basically a Seva Puri Dish served along with Dhai mixed in it. I liked this dish a lot mostly because of the burst different flavors you get in your mouth also along with a soft and crispy bite to it too. The Main Enhancer of the Dish was the Green Chutney that went very well with the Dhai Chat. I overall liked this dish a lot and would recommend you to try it.

My last starter was the Sabudana Wade. This dish was not that appealing mostly because it was a bit oily and the taste of the dish was soaked by the oil. Even after dapping it with the tissue the dish was still oily that‚Äôs why I just had a bit of it but not that appealing.

Later on, I went for the Main course. First, I tried the Chole Kulche. This dish was very tasty and Filling Especially  the Butter on the kulche was the boots to the taste of the Entire dish. The chole was well marinated and cooked with the aroma of spices all the way. The kulche was cooked over a clay tandoor which was crispy and tender .

Then Just for the change of Taste I tried the Panner Makhai. A nice buttery dish cooked in a heavy cream along with very little spices. The Texture of the dish was very appealing which resulted in enhancing the taste of the dish. I tried this dish with Kulche and roti both.

The Last I had was the Gulab Jamun for feeding my Sweet tooth. The best part of the dish was that it was juicy and hot they way I like it. This was the best dish I had over a long time in the sweet dish section  And I recommend you to try this dish for sure."
3,"Burger, fries and coffee was good. Service was quick and staff was attentive. But the Veg wrap was not good, the bread/roti wrapped around the patty was not cooked well. Coffee quantity could have been full as entire cup was not filled up."
1,"Refrain from eating at this outlet. They serve STALE food. I had ordered from here 2days back & received a STALE burger bun. The bread was cracking, breaking & tasted weird. Its like a 4-5 day old unused bread which was served.

The KFC officials are not even bothered to address this issue on X (twitter). Its all fallen into a black hole. Iv been continuously following up with them but there is no response. All they asked was for the order & contact details & said someone will get in touch. But till now nobody has contacted me related to this for trying to resolve the issue or solve the problem.

I strongly recommend to be careful before eating from here or any KFC for that matter. These guys are serving you STALE food and there is zero accountability for it. Licence should be suspended for such outlets."
4,"I had an amazing experience here, The fries taste good soft from inside crispy from outside, the fried chicken is fresh, crispy and delicious, service is fast, love that"
4,KFC Serves the Best chicken food items. Have been a Permanent spot for me i literally love to hog on to the super chargers and the chicken popcorn with extra seasoning over here at Growels Mall 101. It's a bliss for having non veg food. The Staff at this outlet is friendly and quite fast in their service. The service is pretty quick. Overall we had amazing experience here and i'll strongly recommend to try their chicken dishes if you love non veg food! THANKS TO TEAM KFC ACROSS WORLD.
1,Pathetic service and food service is bad received  stale food and when replaced it got hair in it and it was not cleaned properly windpipe was in it
4,"Best pizza but they are using bread that is hard from all corner side..all other stuff in pizza they are using is good & this outlet is available everywhere in every mall‚Ä¶ staff is good & they have good knowledge & there service is also good..

U can use food court place to seat n eat‚Ä¶self service is there‚Ä¶Ambience is ok ok‚Ä¶

If u have any coupen for pizza hut then u can use that coupen only at store its not applicable for online order.."
4,"Pizza here is really tasty and fresh. Located on the third floor of grower mall. Dine in is on the food court, not a separate restaurant."
5,"Ebony Ivory

Perfect dish if you have a sweet tooth!!! Really unique and tastes very good. I will definitely recommend you all to try this dessert."
5,"Tasty pizza,one of the favourite place.. love the pizza üçïüçï"
2,This outlet is in Growels 101 mall at 3rd floor next to Zaffran. We ordered Supreme chiily Garlic bread that turned out to be our worst choice as it was containing Chopped raw onions and raw Chilles that was not cooked properly. And we ordered Taxeas Cheese deep that turned out to be a tangy one. I won't suggest this item to try I was fan of Pizzahuts Garlic bread but it disappointed me
4,"The donuts and eclairs were good, but service was slow. Must try the caramel eclair, KitKat Bliss, and double trouble donut."
4,"I am a big fan of MOD
The only concern here is the seating area. Customers from McDonald's were occupying the space and refused to leave even when informed that it was designated for MOD."
4,"Ordered sea salt nutella donut. The middle custard part was awful, rest of the donut and toppings were really good. Also ordered their kitkat shake, it was good."
3,"A small takeaway joint of a franchise that is known to provide a variety of delectable donuts. They have great combo offers and the options to choose from can be a bit confusing..üòã
In our case it was more of a hit or miss. Some of them were simply heavenly, but a couple were inedible because it tasted like cream mixed with melted plastic.
Maybe it was an off day, but you expect more from a popular chain such as this.."
3,A small outlet of Mad Over Donuts and the only one in Kandivali East which makes it over crowded at times. Location is accessible on ground floor of growel mall. Sadly there is no seating place around in this outlet. Visited it on World Donut Day for their special offer. The staff was quick and efficient. Signature Donuts especially chocolate ones are a must have here. I tried out Swirl It Up and Krunch Kraze alongwith Red Velvet.
5,Great place to have Pav Bhaji. Heard about this plaace and finally tried it. We had Surti Paneer Cheese Ghotala which was served with Pav. It was very tasty. Also tried the Veg Cheese Pudla which was also good. The best part was the service which was very quick. Overall had a great experience. Loved the taste. Value for money.
5,"If you're a fan of Indian street food, this place captures the essence of authentic local dining. It feels like a typical tier-two city eatery‚Äîsimple and unpretentious, yet full of charm. The Black Pav Bhaji is rich, satisfying, and perfect for those craving traditional flavors, while the Coriander Masala Pav is an excellent choice for spice lovers. Whether you're indulging in some Mumbai street food or just looking for a casual meal, this spot offers a no-frills but flavorful experience. Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates promoting Indian brands and local cuisine!"
5,"Just too good!
I tried the green+black+red pav bhaji combo which has buttermilk and roasted papad included.
Black was the best, the other two were close competition! The paav is the special feature as it is huge! Around 8-9 inches of paav!
And the roasted masala tomato onion they provide is extraordinary! That elevates the paav bhaji's taste 3x!
Loved the experience. Waiters were friendly and explained the composition patiently. Buttermilk was also superb! The roasted papad was a necessary complement after that huge dose of butter in the paav and the bhaaji!
Will visit again to try their other stuff as well. The menu is just loaded with unique specialities like bhaaji burger, kolhapuri paav bhaji, varieties of pudla etc.
Must visit!"
4,Have been to this place before and everytime u come here that black pav bhaji  makes u fall in love with that .  their masala khichiya papad is also very good. Their quantity is good n staff is friendly. They have the capability to expand m make it a brand. We tried their blsck masala pav with kothmir that was delicious .all pav bhaji lovers should come here
4,"Just dropped by Maa Anjani Pav Bhaji centre for a family dinner.

Ambiance & Vibes:
A perfect spot for a family dinner. There are AC & Non AC sections available.

Service:
Friendly staff & quick service.

The Mains - Let‚Äôs Dig In! üç¥:
Pav Bhaji ‚ù§Ô∏è:
Wow! This one was simply amazing, Smooth, Flavourful and paired best with onions and a squeeze of lemon. The portion size is generous & enough for a couple.

Cheese Pav Bhaji ‚ù§Ô∏è:
It was just like the regular pav bhaji, but with cheese. It takes away the essence of the delicious bhaji. However, if you like cheese, go for it.

Kothmir Masala Pav üòï:
OK, not everything can be a winner. It was my first time trying it, and I instantIy regretted that. The pav was way too buttery and there was no taste of the green Kothmir filling. I would suggest skipping this one.

Worth It? üçΩÔ∏è:
Overall, Maa Anjani Pav Bhaji has always been my favourite pav bhaji spot! I have always enjoyed it & this is my 5th visit here.

Final Thoughts üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è:
I recommend to avoid the butter pav as it was too overpowering and I was full quickly. Instead, go for simple pav without butter to get the most of the authentic pav bhaji taste & a better experience. Stick with the basics for the best flavours!

Cheers!"
1,"Pros - it‚Äôs a samosa shop so obviously delicious samosas are available but covered with lots of chatni.

Cons
1. Service is very poor, the guy was very lazy, rude and unethical.

2 . The guy was wearing formal clothes thinking that he is kind, but not at all professional.

If you want samosa today, go to shop 2 days before and order."
1,Taken Surti undhiyu totally  totally testeless  n worst quality for Rs700 per kg not worrth bit worst  suggestion don‚Äôt buy UNDHIYU AT ANY COST
3,One of the oldest farsan shop and most preferred in neighbourhood only thing which spoils the fun is staff and the owners are very rude with an very rough customer service !
2,"I would have given 5 stars if it weren't for the attitude of one of the bespectacled owners in the morning.

Everything is amazing here. The best fafda, kachori, and samosas, along with a variety of farsan, all made fresh daily. The fafda is truly the best you can find in this region.

His demeanor is significantly contributing to the decline of this place. He doesn't smile and acts as if he's doing you a favor by selling you food. There's a complete lack of politeness.

In this day and age, if the owner isn't humble, polite, and greeting customers with a warm smile, it can spell disaster for even the most long-standing establishments, regardless of how good the food is."
1,"Totally overhyped. Absolutely zero in taste, quality and price unnecessary high.
Samosa just has big boil potatoes and no masala,etc. even the sides along with Fafda has no taste. Fafda are not properly cooked and stick in mouth.
Shree ram Fafda were much much better."
3,"I recently visited Apsara Ice Cream Shop, and while the service was top-notch - the staff were friendly and attentive - the product itself was a letdown.

We purchased the mango family pack for ‚Çπ400, but unfortunately, it didn't meet our expectations. The ice cream was surprisingly powdery, and the fruits were over-frozen, losing their natural texture and taste.

On the positive side, the shop is conveniently located, making it a great spot to grab a quick treat.

If you do visit Apsara, I'd recommend opting for their scoop ice creams, which appear to be fresher. Alternatively, consider exploring natural ice cream options for a more authentic real taste experience."

They have nice ice creams and have some nice schemes for customers on reaching certain score they get some ice creams or other options depending on the score.
They have 5 categories of ice creams
Fruitylicious
Nuttylicious

Kulfilicious.

We had
Guava glory ( highly recommended)
Asli alphonso
Pan pasand with coconut
Cookies n cream

3,"I have visited various outlets of Apsara  Ice Creams, but this particular one doesn't quite hit the mark for me. It's on the smaller side, offers a limited selection of flavours, and seems to lack consistency in maintaining standard operating procedures, especially for one of my favourite flavours(Pani puri sorbet).

However, setting aside these concerns, I must say that as a brand, Apsara Ice Creams never fail to impress with their Pani Puri and Watermelon Sorbet. These are absolute must-tries.

Additionally, their Mango Ice Cream, served with freshly cut Alphonso mango pieces, is a dream come true for any mango lover. I had the pleasure of trying it at their kiosk outlet in Infinity Mall, Malad.  The Mahavir Nagar outlet as always didn‚Äôt have it."
4,"Simple ice cream with a lot of varities.the quantity is good.can prefer with waffle or cup .it has a rich creamy texture.it also has some rewards or points system like 1 re is equal to 1 point and can redeem in the next buy.i have tried orange apricot,coconut tender and hazelnut chocolate all tastes good.should try once"
4,"While I loved their baked potatoes with mozzarella cheese and multiple sauces. Their Shake was not up to the mark.

A nice place to sit and have a quick bite, tasty  different style food. Overall a nice experience and a pretty filling one for both of us

So you may plan a trip to this place with friends or family, kids would love the place"
5,For the first time we tried this baked jacket potato and honestly never expected this. It was so so amazing and delicious. It was loaded with mozzarella and cheddar cheese and various sauces and 1 is easily enough for 2 people. This is a must try so definitely visit this place üòç
5,"I recently tried the UFO Corn & Fries restaurant and had an amazing experience. The standout dish was their Chitpotle Cheese Burger, which had the perfect balance of spice and cheesiness, making it a flavorful delight. The Three Cheese Fries were a treat for cheese lovers, with a combination of oregano cheese, orange cheese, and grated cheese, creating a deliciously gooey and satisfying snack. To complement the meal, we chose the Peach Ice Tea, which was refreshing and complemented the flavors perfectly. Overall, every item we tried was absolutely yummy and left us craving for more. Highly recommended!"

5,"Food is awesome they are well known for Pavbhaji. I believe you should directly get a parcel rather than buying through swiggy or Zomato, they are over priced compared to directly buying from restaurant."
3,"One night, I had this terrible craving to eat khichidi, and I remembered that someone suggested trying this place out as they have great vegetarian options. I browsed their menu on Google and found a mixed vegetable khichidi to be interesting. I called and placed the order, and I was told in 30 minutes that the parcel would arrive and the bill was 170/-.

Though I found it to be expensive for a simple khichidi, I was expecting really mind-blowing with all the suggestions I received. I waited, and I waited, and I waited till I finally lost patience as the time frame crossed an hour and still no khichidi. I call, and this girl/woman/lady answers the call and gives me jazz about why the order is taking so long, cleverly done coz when a female answers the call out of traditional respect we don't scream and shout at them and with this these people get away with what they do.

All said and done, the khichidi arrived cold and tasted very basic. In the name of vegetables, it had beans, carrots, and capsicum. The portion was ok, not great, nor bad. It's definitely not worth paying 170/-, maybe what I can do is cook a khichidi one day and ask them to taste it for reference when they decide to charge you 170/- for food that tastes like it was cooked for a hospital and served cold.

This place is no longer on my try again list. Maybe the other items on the menu might be good, and people like what they serve; however, I've not seen a lot of people who actually know what food is all about."

As always excellent food, ambience n experience!"

The sitaphal Rabri is a must have."
5,"I recently dined at Garden Court Restaurant in Malad West and had a delightful experience. The ambiance was warm and inviting, creating a comfortable setting for our meal. The staff was exceptionally friendly and attentive, ensuring we felt welcomed throughout our visit.

We opted for vegetarian dishes, which were flavorful and well-prepared. The menu offers a variety of options, including popular choices like soups, dum biryani, and Hakka noodles Mr. Ramesh assisted us in selecting our dishes, and his recommendations were spot-on, enhancing our dining experience.ÓàÜ

The service was prompt and efficient, with staff members demonstrating a genuine commitment to customer satisfaction. The restaurant's sophisticated atmosphere and private dining rooms make it an excellent choice for both intimate dinners and family gatherings.

Overall, Garden Court Restaurant offers a harmonious blend of delectable cuisine, courteous service, and a pleasant environment. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a memorable dining experience in Malad West.

Chaitanya and Priyangshu (who are from Indian Idol 15 Top 5 Contestants) were with us for dinner tonight"

Infact other outlets get limited Truffles, this outlet has adequate stock available. The people over the billing  counter are  helpful to guide you about any cakes, pasty, breakfast snacks.

Great work! Keeping Going.. I give a 5 star ‚≠ê for a superb service."

1,"Owner would be not available at times, the shop would be closed during working hours, the cakes would not be fresh and owner doesn't store them properly guess he is saving his electricity bill, would never go there and wouldn't recommend going there either, try ocean's cake or ribbons and ballons or any other which is near to it..."
4,"Let me rate the dishes that i ordered

Beef roast - superb taste, the rate is around 400 rs a plate but worth trying, i give 4 star for this.

Rabbit curry - not good, maybe I tried first time, i dint like it. I give 1 star for this.

Rice, sambar, avial - No less than a proper wedding food. Awesome. I give 4 star

Payasam (kheer) - tasty, i give 3.5 star for this"
2,"A very average Kerala Restraunt in Malad near to Our Lady of Lourdes church having Veg meals(Kerala Oonu) and non veg dishes as well. The cost is bit towards the mid range, but the food is not worth the cost. Not the best Kerala Restraunts to start with. Best to visit for parishioners after the service in the church."
4,"Cherry's is a nice small place run by a cordial owner. Went for a Sunday lunch, place was overrun by mallus (good sign for a kerala restaurant) who wanted to eat kappa biryani. We had prawns, clams and beef curry with appams and Parotta. Parotta was a little chewy, everything else was perfect. Too busy eating to take photos of anything except prawns."

This place is a small fast food center consisting of tasty food
U might have tried open bread pizza bites but they have a fusion in it they use potato in replacement of bread and they put the all the pizza stuffing with some green chillies on it and they named the dish as chilli potato bites.
The cost of the dish is ‚Çπ160
And also visit the place and try different dishes."
4,I visit this place a lot. It is a small fast food joint but with some amazing dishes. There different sandwiches are worth trying. The white sauce pasta they have is like the best and the masala pav they put cheese sauce on it. It is really a treat to cheese lovers. The prices also are really reasonable.
5,Great experience ordering from here. Custom cake with unique requirements were fulfilled very well. Owner and managing people are friendly and understanding enough to cater various requirements. Personally had ordered cake for a party and it was made incredibly well.
5,"Can't recommend them enough. Thank you so much for the beautiful creation, the exquisite taste and timely delivery."
5,I have always loved the cakes that Ocean Baking Beauties bake. They are impeccable with their design without loosing the flavours. This year too for my daughter‚Äôs birthday we ordered Harry Potter cake it was simply amazing
5,"I have ordered the mix fruit cream cake for the first time from THE OCEANS, Trust me ""The best cake"" ever I had till date, it was super fresh... Thanks for the amazing taste...
PYI - 100% recommended(must try)"
5,The cake was really amazing. Taste wise and look wise both. Thank you so much
1,Very worst experience ever...we was having an important meetings and the person is on our head to order something...n it's not lyk we have not ordered anything we had ordered things but they were forced us to order per person..n their behaviour was so rude to customers and we will never suggest to come at this CCD .very disappointing behaviour.pls pls pls dnt come at this CCD
3,"Overall, CCDay's brand seems to be experiencing a decline. The service, while okay, is hindered by a lack of sufficient staff, leading to delays and a less-than-optimal experience.

The food remains acceptable, with the usual menu items still holding up, but the coffee, which is priced at a premium, doesn't quite meet the expectations for the cost.

There's room for improvement in both service and overall value to match the brand's former reputation."
5,Best cafe in Malad West area.. where I can spend time with family and friends with good coffee and food as well
5,"Nice to meet friends for brunch or some meeting. The ambience is very good.
Free wifi if you want to do work."
5,"Nice cosy clean place, quick service and comfortable seating. Had Cafe Latte which was nice to start my day and Cocoa fantasy pastry which I couldn't resist having after having one glance at it. The cafe almost empty as they had just opened half an hour ago. I would certainly recommend this place to chill and hangout with your near and dear ones."
1,"I had a deeply disappointing experience at Pizza Hut in Mahavir Nagar, Kandivali, yesterday, on February 18th. The quality of both the food and the ambience appears to be declining day by day. I have been a loyal patron of Pizza Hut since I was 16 years old, and at 40, I must regretfully say that there is little to admire about the establishment anymore.

Prices have increased significantly, while the quality of the food has diminished considerably. We were served pasta in an aluminum foil box that resembled the size of a pre-primary child‚Äôs tiffin box‚Äîbarely enough for my 10-year-old son and the taste was terrible, not sure if they were falling short of plates. In the past, the portion sizes were more generous and served directly on plates, enough to satisfy at least two adults. Now, the decline in quantity is truly alarming.

The chicken wings were disappointingly small, with little meat on them, and the drinks were served in small glasses, in stark contrast to the large ones we used to enjoy. Each visit seems to feature a new staff member who fails to take orders correctly. They seem to rely on memory rather than writing things down, leading to frequent mistakes and forgotten items. This happened during my visit yesterday where the staff completely forgot one order of chicken wings, and later it did not arrive for over 20 minutes.

The main course took over 40 minutes to arrive, despite the restaurant being relatively empty at the time. We ordered a meal for two, selecting different beverages as indicated on the menu, only to receive two of the same. When I pointed out the error, the staff member asked, ""Ye nahi chalega kya (Isn't this okay)?""‚Äîan astonishing response. Instead of acknowledging the mistake and rectifying it promptly, I was made to feel like I should accept it. They eventually corrected the order, but the initial response was frustrating. We ordered a chicken tikka pizza with barely any chicken on it. It just felt like a bread with toppings of tomatoes and other things except chicken. Stop fooling people in the name of chicken pizza.

What truly disturbed me after this experience was the state of the washroom. It fell far short of the standard I expect from Pizza Hut. Water was spilled everywhere, creating a safety hazard, and there were used tissue papers scattered about. The washbasin was unclean, with noticeable stains, and an unpleasant odor lingered in the air. Plus there were flies lingering on the opposite side table.

For the first time ever, I felt so disheartened that I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to address these issues with management. I strongly urge Pizza Hut to take steps to improve the overall experience. Your prices are steep, the food portions are inadequate, and the ambience leaves much to be desired. Furthermore, the staff needs better training in order-taking. If things do not improve, I may have to reconsider my loyalty and explore dining options with competitors. Thank you for your attention."
5,Location is good but service is not satisfied. The staff take order but take too much of time to serve food.
1,"Very slow and worst outlet of pizza hut so far
After Ordering pizza I waited for approx 55 mins with continuous followups about the pizza.
The pizza was cold when it arrived. 3 families left the place when the pizza was not delivered to them on time"
1,"Avoid eating or ordering from this pizza hut outlet. This is one of the worst Outlets that i have ever eaten at Pizza hut ... possibly the worst Pizza Hut outlet for its quality.

I had ordered 3 Pan sized pizzas in combo (2 Margarita and 1 onion capsicum) through Swiggy on 29th Oct evening. I missed to change the outlet to another one that is near by and instead ordered the pizza from the default outlet option in swiggy app.. i.e. Kandivali west Mahavir Nagar west.

The pizzas that got delivered are a SHAM in the name of Pizzas!! Check the photos shared with this review that shows the quality of cheese, the sauce texture, etc.. says it all!

Please ensure you AVOID this location when ordering from pizza Hut.

Earlier too i had faced similar issues when ordered from this location and hence I have been avoiding it till today.. where i ordered by mistake.

I also see so many other people have shared their review.. espectially burnt pizzas!

If pizza hut franchise owners are reading this.. they need to seriously audit this place again for its quality since i believe, this outlet is spoiling the brand's Name.

Please avoid this outlet at any cost!!"
5,"I want to express my gratitude to the team at Pizza Hut's Profit Centre, Mahavir Nagar outlet, especially Nikita, who handled the situation with great professionalism. After an earlier issue where I received a burnt pizza, they promptly addressed the matter by providing a replacement. I truly appreciate their customer-focused approach.

I had initially left a negative review out of disappointment, but their swift and thoughtful resolution, led by Nikita, has completely changed my perspective. The replacement pizza was excellent, and their gesture has restored my confidence in their service."
5,"Landmark is my ultimate comfort zone. Whether it's their sizzling hot sizzlers (literally 11/10), rich and cheesy lasagna, or flavorful Chinese dishes, everything hits the spot. Even their North Indian meals are packed with taste and warmth. A place where every bite feels like a hug. Highly recommend for anyone who loves variety without compromising on taste!"
4,"Easy to locate, near Liberty Garden. One of the best Vegetarian family restaurant for all kinds of cuisines. We tried paneer tikka sizzler and paneer mughlai here which was one of the best starters. Pinacolada was not worth the value. The landmark special kofta in main course was very tasty and perfect blend of spices used. I would recommend visiting this place anytime for a good food mood! Very hygienic and well maintained with fairly priced menu."
4,Over the period of time they have improved...service and taste wise ...tried their sizzler as suggested by their team ...it was really good ...they tried to maintain what allergies were told not to include in food ...good staff...
4,"Today is my first ever time in Landmarks. I am very happy to find such a good restaurant. Two dishes I tried, one in morning their stuffed paratha and another in lunch hours Landmark special noodles. Both were awesome. This is the first time ever I found Cashew nuts in noodles and strangely I liked it very much. However, I gave them a suggestion to use dry roast or little fried cashew nuts to enhance their special noodles taste."
4,Good food but they need to improve on the atmosphere and service
5,"I recently visited J-fries in Mahavir Nagar for a quick snack and was blown away by the delicious taste of their fries with Mexican and chipotle sauce. The fries were perfectly crispy, and the combination of sauces added a unique and enjoyable flavor to them.

Despite the years that have passed since J fries opened their first store in Carter Road, their quality has remained consistently high. I have been a loyal customer of theirs for a long time, and I am happy to say that they have never disappointed me.

Although their prices may be slightly higher than other places that serve fries, the taste and quality more than make up for the cost. I believe that J fries is worth every penny and I have never regretted eating there.

Overall, I highly recommend J fries to anyone looking for a tasty and satisfying snack. Their delicious fries, paired with a range of unique sauces, are sure to leave you feeling satisfied and happy."
5,"The J has some of the best options to choose from if you're looking for a place to have really awesome fries! This place is definitely one of the many sorted hangout spots for friends. They have various types of fries served i.e. Chipotle Fries, Cheezy Fries, BBQ fries, Peri peri fries etc. and also some refreshing drinks on the menu! Definitely a place one should visit especially if you're craving for fries üçü"
4,"Can be either a total hit or total miss!

This place is located near balaji party hall of mahavir Nagar which is 10-15 min away from kandivali station.

Service and staff of this place is fine not overwhelming, it can be a disaster at times. When it does the quality of the food gets affected too.

What I tried

BBQ cheese fries

A great combination of Crisp fries with BBQ sauce and jalapeno Cheese. It has never disappointed me.

Chilli cheese fries

If you prefer chilli garlic sauce then you will definitely love this. It comes with jalapeno Cheese with chilli garlic sauce.

Oreo milkshake

A must have shake üòç

I would love this place to be more consistent!

Food: 4/5

Ambiance: 3.5/5

Service 4/5"
5,"The J was an awesome experience at Mahavir Nagar very nice and cute clean place to eat fries they make it really awesome we tried Tandoori Chilli Fries and Pizza fries each ‚Çπ160
They really had lip smacking taste and they were awesome I was Curious about their milkshakes and tried Butterscotch Caramel milkshake and it really had great taste and added great value to the food it was amazing Really enjoyed it!‚ô•Ô∏è"
4,"Awesome Fries are synonymous with The J. They serve best in town fries at reasonable rates. This Kandivali outlet is vegetarian only. My all time favorite are Pizza fries & Barbecue  fries. Their shakes are also worth trying. Good ambiance, quick service & fabulous fries.. what else you need in life to enjoy it fullest? Highly recommended."
3,"Had a mixed experience. While the mojito and chicken tarts were delicious, the prawn dish had a strong fishy smell that overshadowed the flavors. The fish fingers were also a bit pricey for the quantity served.

One more thing I found odd about this place was to give order at the billing counter"
5,Excellent breakfast food  options & great quality of food... One thing you must have here is mutton keema pav.. as good as stadium & Olympia restaurant in townside.
5,"The Burrow Cafe in Orlem, Sunder Lane, is a nice place for breakfast, with a lovely spread. They also have sandwiches, burgers, small plates, and mains. We went there for breakfast and the food was nice."
4,"Had heard about this place and had seen some reviews on Insta, wanted to go and checkout for breakfast but never got a chance!!
Was around Orlem for some shopping and ended up here for lunch. Quite a nice place, with AC indoor seating and ample open seating outside, perfect for the evening.
Wanted to try the steak n cheese sandwich, but the meat was out of stock üòî, so ordered the Spaghetti Chicken Parmesan, it had a perfect crumb fried chicken breast all soft and juicy inside and crispy, covered with melted cheese with perfect flavour served with some spaghetti. I felt there could be a lil more spaghetti as it was main part of the dish, instead of serving on a bed of spaghetti it was just spread around the chicken. But taste was awesome....
Tried the Chicken Satay Cheese Sauce Sizzler, again an awesome melange of fresh crisp veggies, french fries chicken satay and caramelized onion with mexican,  rice, worth the cost. Cheese Chilli French Fries...were done to perfection..we all loved it. Ended with some Affagato, hot espresso with a scoop of vanilla ice -cream!!  Surely coming back for more...this time for breakfast üòÑ"
3,"The coffee options are great, but the quality & taste of food has been steadily going down.

Don't miss the Vietnamese Cold Coffee which is really good. We tried and liked the Affogato too.

Food sadly used to be good. The parmesan cheese toast was good, everything else we had was below average.

The service is unpredictable. Some of the staff are really nice & well trained, some have quite a lazy attitude towards work.

Overall a good place to have coffee & get some work done. Go someplace else if you're hungry though."
5,"A Long-Time Favorite That Never Disappoints
This place has been a go-to for many over the years, and for good reason. Their Chicken and Mushroom Pot Rice is a standout ‚Äì hearty, delicious, and full of flavor. The menu offers a great selection of starters, making it easy to find something for every taste. They've recently expanded by opening a new restaurant in Dubai, so fans can now enjoy their favorites in a new location as well. A must-try spot!

Would you like to add any personal touch or specific dishes from the starters section?"
5,All I can say is that Uncle's Kitchen is legendary! The food is just amazing and hits the taste buds just right. Visiting India after a while and first thing on the agenda was to come here again and the food quality and flavor is still the same. My best wishes to Uncle's Kitchen and wish you continued success:)
4,"Have always loved the food here. It's authentic Indian Chinese and the taste hasn't changed one bit. This time was a bit different though. Everything except the Dry Manchurian was good. Veg Crispy was also okayish but the manchow soup, fried rice and gravy Manchurian was simply out of the world

Service is mostly self service there so not sure why they've kept so many waiters. The least they can do is serve in plates which sometimes happens if you sit in the AC section

Overall a good experience as always and would definitely go back here for Chinese every single time I get an opportunity"
1,"Naam Bade Aur Darshan Chote.

1. Long waiting time
2. In terms of service they deliver you the food to table that‚Äôs it. Serving you have to do it on your own.
3. Food isn‚Äôt that good. The taste is worst.
4. Just by showing celebrities photos on your menu won‚Äôt get you repeat customers.
5. If anybody has tried any good Chinese food, they will surely give 1-2 stars to this restaurant.
6. The taste doesn‚Äôt justify the price."
3,"I visited this restaurant after hearing positive reviews from my friends. Starting with the ambiance and atmosphere, it was pleasant, and the service was excellent. However, the food did not meet my expectations. Price to quantity ratio is not that good.

We ordered Manchow soup, which was great‚Äîthe classic soup with the perfect taste. Next, we tried the apple chicken, which is essentially chicken lollipops tossed in Szechuan sauce. It was good, but not outstanding; the Szechuan chutney was basic, which made the overall dish average.

We also ordered Singapore rice and noodles, which were pretty good but too oily. I recommend opting for the classic noodles or rice instead of the mixed version.

Overall, it's a good place for a quick meal, as the service is fast."
1,"Worse food quality and hygiene is not maintained.
The first time, the chicken was stale and tasted like it had been double fried. On the second occasion, my cousin ordered the same dish and shockingly found a chicken feather still attached to the lollipop. This is completely unacceptable from a hygiene and food safety perspective. I‚Äôve attached a photo for reference."
5,It is a nice place to eat with your friends and family. Not spacious but it's good. Prices are reasonable chicken & chicken tandoori lollipop they both are super delicious
4,"A name which captivated us into dreaming of all the delicious food we have missed during the lockdown..üòã Their menu mainly comprises North Indian & Chinese cuisine. The food was delivered in neat packaging. We ordered the following :
Chicken Crispy - As the name goes, the chicken coating was crispy and was a great start to this hearty meal. Not too spicy, the quantity was great as well..üòÅ
Veg Manchurian Rice - Simple veg fried rice combined with scrumptious manchurian gravy. The manchurian was itself well cooked and soft..
Chicken Chilli Rice with Gravy - Chicken fried rice was delicious and good in itself, but when combined with the flavour packed chicken chilli gravy it was mouth watering to say the least. The gravy was thick and had large chunks of chicken..ü§§
Paneer Butter Masala - Soft chunks of paneer cooked in medium spicy gravy with a few veggies. It was not the best, but it was not bad either.."
1,"üõëPLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE  AS YOU WILL GET UNCOOKED Raw CHICKEN. DON'T BELIEVE IN THE GOOD REVIEWS üõë
Recently ordered butter chicken which had  UNDERCOOKED RAW CHICKEN AND WAS LIKE RUBBER.  Called the number and informed the owner who just took it lightly.  INFORMED the owner can get the butter chicken returned back to him to show the UNCOOKED RAW CHICKEN.
Owner refused to acknowledge the issue  and take ownership of the ISSUE OF THE UNCOOKED CHICKEN ...üëéüèΩ.JUST SAID THAT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN NEXT TIME. üëéüèΩüëéüèΩüëéüèΩNEXT TIME WILL NEVER HAPPEN AS WILL NEVER ORDER AGAIN üëéüèΩüëéüèΩ.. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE .

It's not about the cost it's about how you treat customers and take necessary steps to correct if there is any issue with the food preparation. Typical Banya attitude they just want your money without giving proper service."
1,"Third class recipe and services. I ordered naan, chicken kolhapuri and malai seekh biryani. Kolhapuri was tasteless and biryani was totally worst, it was like mixture of boiled rice, spices and seekh kabab only and when I complaint about it over the call they said 'hamare yaha Aisa hi Banta hai' totally disappointed answer I got. (-1 rating if available)

I have ordered few times only from this restaurant but every time got disappointed üòû
If you are looking for outing food then please find other restaurant instead of this."
5,Excellent taste and the weekend menu is amazing. Have tried the food every weekend for the last month every dish was lip smacking good. Thanks for maintaining the quality of Food. Ordering Extra portions of the desert is so tempting
5,Best catering service for any house party hands down... once u try their food you will never think twice about reordering from them for any party. Been a return customer to them for a long time and still love the authentic taste and love they put into cooking... a must try
5,"Excellent food, it's only a takeaway place that has a pre order system. Great stuff for pork, chicken and beef dishes and starters. High standard of food ingredients and good portions"
5,"The finest quality of ingredients are used,  the meats are cooked to perfection and each meal is prepared with great finesse!"
5,Very Good
4,"Tulsi is one of the busiest place in Mahavir Nagar, they are even pack on a weekday

The food here is decent and it‚Äôs has earned goodwill over the years

We took a take away and was amazed with their brilliant packaging

The quantity of food here is very good.

Paneer Crispy - 3/5  The item could have been a lot better. The paneer was although soft but we did not like it.

Alfredo Pasta - 4/5  the quantity of pasta was nice. Even it tasted amazing. But it had become sticky by the time we reached home. The place should add more sauce and pack it in a larger container

Italian Biryani - 5/5 It was simply amazing. Very well made dish and it was delicious in taste. Must order

Big Sicillian Noodles - 5/5 The quality of this is massive. It can suffice 3 people at a time. They serve 3 different types of noodles with manchurian gravy. It is definitely value for money and it was lovely

Overall a good experience here. We visit this place Atleast once in a month."
2,"We were looking for some place which can serve us quick food, thus decided to visit Tulsi.

They offer Veg. and Pure Jain food
The place is just too small, at a time max 10 people could accommodate.
Actually, they are more into delivery, so has very limited space.
The prices of dishes are quite pocket friendly

Talking about the food, we had ordered few dishes:

DRY MANCHURIAN PIZZA - It was a unique pizza, with Manchurian as a topping. It was quite good in taste. But the size was little small.

NACHOS - They were just not acceptable. The cheese sauce was very bad at taste as well as it was very thin. Nachos was a bad idea.

CHEESE BURST RICE - Another unique dish that we had. It was good at taste, but expected more. The cheese was too less, also the quantity of rice was less for the price.
Talking about the service,we thought that the service would be quick as there were no customers, but it was not.The service was slow.

Overall it was a bad experience, only the Pizza was good. If you every want to try this place then go for Chinese only, don't go for anything else."
5,"Tulsi is small & amazing outlet in Mahavir nagar which serves Italian and Chinese food. They Reopened the place.
.
What we had :-
.
1) Peri Peri Paneer - It was very tasty with all the tangy flavours of the peri peri sauce. I would totally recommend it.
.
2) Grande Mix Pasta (chefs recommended) - The pasta was the best I've ever had in my life. It includes exotic veggies, cream cheese with red & white sauce. It was mix, rich, decadent and tasted like a slice..
.
3) Triple Exotic Rice (chefs recommended) - Triple Rice was amazing. It's including veggie combination  with gravy. In gravy, the manchurian was perfectly cooked and tasty.
.
Overll Experience was Good. Staff was nice & helpful."
4,"Awesome place for cheese loversüòç

We visited this outlet yesterday & we're amazed by the taste that these people serve.

It's a small outlet with around 10-12 people ka total seating space.

Ambience is not that great but it's an ideal choice if you order at your doorstep.
There were literally 10 Zomato guys standing outside the outlet to pick their order, this makes it clear that the place is doing better on the delivery side.

What we tried -

Peri peri Paneer
Penne pasta in white sauce
Big Sicilian Rice

The food was mind blowing & full of flavour.
Peri Peri paneer was a semi gravy dish with superb taste.
Pasta was done is creamy sauce & was served with garlic bread.
Finally The Big Sicilian Rice was a combination of 3 different types of Rice served with machurian gravy, this was awesome too.

Ratings-
Food - 4/5
Service - 3/5
Ambience - 3/5

Overall experience was good & we actually enjoyed our meal.

Note - They serve unique cheesy dishes like Cheese Tower, Deep Fried Cheese, Cheese Fondue & a lot more. So now you know why I said 'Awesome place for cheese lovers'

Happy Eatingüòãüòãüòã

5,"That's our family restaurant. All the staff members of this restaurant are very humble, polite with great manners to host their customers. We ordered all the best Italian and Mexican dishes over here and honestly the taste was mind-blowing. They also give us Chocolate Brownie as a compliment. Please if you are in Mumbai then try their all food dishes. Thank you üôèüèª"
5,One of best veg family restaurant in malad locality. I personally like the taste of food and service.
5,"Great staff with good service‚Ä¶ extraordinary wider range of menu and testy food in an affordable price.
Must must must try üòã"
1,One of my worst experience ever. Ordered salad comprising only of tomato n cucumber and was charged rs 300 for it and what I received was a bitter cucumber which obviously my son didn‚Äôt eat. Ordered masala papad n they gave masala khichiya papad which I asked to be changed and what they got after 2 returns was a plain fried papad. Felt like they are taking orders from a customer first time. Horrible experience and complete waste of money. Will never come back for sure.
5,"This Jumbo King Outlet is located in Malad East, adjacent to the Malad railway station bridge. The burgers are good if you're looking to grab a quick bite of Veg Burgers. Mac n Cheese Burger, Big Crunch Burger, Macroni Burger, etc etc. Good place for a casual hangout with friends."
1,"This is the second time we are facing the same issue. Even after giving 2-3 reminders while packing burgers, they not packed ketchup according to burger count, they are totally ignoring an pack the order accordingly they want.
Jamboking, kindly check and take action on the Malad Station East store ‚Äî they are not packing our orders properly."
1,"Very high prices, foods not worth of price, poster and actual foods are really bad and different"
5,The server pooja is veryyyyy rude she doesn't even say sorry don't have any knowledge about food and drink  I'm daily customer of jumbo King and this happen to me very bad experience about because of poojaa
1,"Very bad experience, aalu tikki was not properly fried, my both son suffered to eat that tikki."
4,Visited this one of the oldest restaurants in Ballard estate after a very long time. The owner mentioned to me that this restaurant is 95+ years old Excellent service by well experienced old staff who take the pride to serve individual customers. Their dhal vada used to be excellent. Unfortunately I could not get it today. It‚Äôs a must place to visit if you are around Ballard estate area.
1,"Quantity very less compared to the price, size of the idli vada reduces every month, for parcel they send only 2 tea spoonsful samber, have a look at the container of Samber"
5,"I had first time Poha there, was delicious for 50Rs very nice ppl there üôå"
4,"A place with the Old Bombay charm to it. It certainly has preserved it's old charm and also, the food they serve is exceptional. Usually their full menu is functional from 11:30 am, but our bad luck that we could only taste the medu vadas and chai. I will certainly re visit this place for their lunch and dosas, highly recommended"
3,A retro type atmosphere. You will love it. Food is ok. A good tea. Service is quick. It will remind you a movie Lunch Box.
5,"One of my most most most favourite CCD in Mumbai. It‚Äôs opposite to CSMT station, right next to McDonald‚Äôs.
The place is extremely cozy, the food ofcourse is good but the best thing is the service which is top-notch.
I‚Äôve being greeted and served by one of their staff member Mr. Yogesh Sawant. He is very friendly and always with a big smile. His food and beverage recommendations are also too good.
If you want to do some chit-chat and be comfortable then CCD is your place.
I‚Äôve had their peach-iced tea, hazelnut hot chocolate, Iced mocha and chicken burger. The food and drinks were good!"
5,"I recently visited Cafe Coffee Day and had a wonderful experience. The ambiance of the cafe is cozy and inviting, making it a perfect place to relax and enjoy a cup of coffee. The staff members were friendly and attentive, ensuring that I had a pleasant visit.

The menu offers a wide variety of coffee options, and I was delighted by the quality and taste of the coffee I ordered. They have a good selection of both hot and cold beverages, and the presentation was impressive. The prices were reasonable, considering the quality and service provided.

The cafe also offers a decent range of snacks and pastries to complement your coffee. I tried their chocolate muffin, and it was delicious. The seating arrangements were comfortable, and I appreciated the availability of free Wi-Fi, which allowed me to catch up on work while enjoying my coffee.

I would definitely recommend Cafe Coffee Day to coffee lovers who are looking for a cozy spot to relax, have a chat, or get some work done. The combination of great coffee, pleasant ambiance, and friendly staff makes it a reliable choice for a coffee break."
1,"Pathetic staff. In fact worst staff.
They are very complicated as they make it compulsory for you to order from their mobile application. And then the order is  not processed unless they scan the app.

Also on top of it. If you want to work from cafe then they expect you to keep ordering after every 2 hours."
3,"Generally, everything is good. Note that in CCD, unlike Starbucks you can be asked to leave after 1 hour if there are people who can't get a table, even if you are willing to order more. So not suitable for working. And wifi is limited to 1GB iirc."
5,"I love Cafe Coffee Day! It's a nice, cozy place with a lot of coffee options. The one thing I would say is that the service times are pretty long and it can be quite noisy. But I don't mind as it just means more time to relax."
5,"Really good experience at the McDonald‚Äôs in Fort Branch. The staff is super friendly and helpful, which made the visit even better. Everything I ordered tasted great ‚Äì fresh, hot, and just how I like it. Plus, the place was really clean, which is always a big plus. Definitely one of the better McD‚Äôs I‚Äôve been to!"
1,"I visited the Fort, Mumbai Restaurant for a breakfast, I was getting late my office is nearby the restaurant.
The crew name Kuldeepkumar took so long to take a single order from the app, while i was placing it from App offers the crew said the QR is not working, i said OK.
Rather than attending a customer, crew was busy talking on the phone and was running for the parcel orders.

When i took my single burger, i really don‚Äôt know when it was prepared as it was not prepared freshly on the standard time.

The bread was not at all good, i was suppose to inform the same crew about it.. but i was getting late and was hungry too.. also there was a rush at order taking counter.

What I analysis their must be crews at
morning shift and the restaurant should maintain the quality of the product, according to their location.

I hope this feedback works for you.

Thank you."
4,"This place is in an excellent location and offers a pleasant overall experience. The ambiance is nice, and the service is up to the mark. The staff are friendly, welcoming, and always ready to help, which definitely adds to the comfort of the visit.

The only issue I faced was the strong smell of handwash that seems to linger throughout the place. It can be a bit overwhelming at times. I believe a little attention to improving the fragrance or ventilation would make the environment even better. Apart from that, everything was great!"
5,"My first time in Mumbai with my friend. We tried McDonald's @ Empire Building. It was a pleasant experience with a cozy atmosphere, clean surroundings and friendly staff.."
5,The place is quite good and like the food is also very nice ! The place is peaceful.
1,"Accepted and confirmed an order to deliver for 12 people on my train starting from CSMT. Even asked for and confirmed Rs. 200 delivery charges. On the given date and time, did not deliver and refused to even take the phone call. Cannot be relied on."
5,Delicious food.  I am a non vegetarian and I love the Veg Menu here. . Thanks.  You make my lunch a happy lunch. .
1,We called them up for Corporate order discussion. The Owner was very rude and upfrontly denied any business quoting high rates.
1,Please Don‚Äôt do any business or don‚Äôt order any food items with this person. He don‚Äôt know mean of commitment. Don‚Äôt answer also on phone.
5,Good for lunch but restaurant name is something else
5,"This isn't just a restaurant- it's a portal to Goa, in the midst of Mumbaiü•∞

The owner, Mr Jude, is a delight every time- not only a food connoisseur but also the most hospitable host!

The entrance and the seating area themselves announce the Goa-ness of the treat one is about to indulge in. And then the introduction of every dish , inclusive of discussion of elements of goan cuisine, by Mr Jude is just the experience  that completes the teleportation to goa. üòé

The top dishes for me so far will be chorizo- fries, chicken cafreal  (not included in pics), barbecue pork (not included in pics).

This time we gave Mutton a try despite my fears; and got delightfully surprised by succulent Mutton pieces. Plus Mutton cutlets are a must try- minced Mutton with potato fried with mild spices, no egg... Very nicely doneüëå

We tried a Goan bread called poee- very interesting,,,, crispy on outside and soft inside. Coated with wheat bran on the outside i think

Although not left for space, complimentary plum cake is still welcomedü§§

And we got luckier this time, we got a flan insteadü§© Creamy and mildly sweet üòç

Still so many dishes left for trying. Will go there many more times for sure!"
5,"It was a good decision to bring my Goan mother for an authentic delicacy. I truly appreciated the way the owner interacted with us. The single staff member was also effective in understanding and conveying our needs.

The dishes we tried, including the ross omelet, sauguti, and chicken cafreal, were truly delightful. We genuinely enjoyed our weekend lunch"
5,"Authentic Goan food, homemade flavours, cozy ambience . Very kindly hosted by Jude."
5,"Amazing place‚Ä¶ although we were late they welcomed us and didn‚Äôt let us leave without some food. We had the Chicken Xacuti, Mutton curry, Rice and Pav and for desserts Blueberry & Strawberry tarts. The food is well cooked and the hospitality is 10/0. They close at 7.30 pm so if you want to have a taste of Goa in the heart of Mumbai you definitely need to come here"
5,"Great restaurant I found in Google maps and wandered over for lunch.

The pork vindaloo was excellent and the owner was very friendly. We chatted while the food was being prepared and I really enjoyed the meal. Highly recommended."
4,Was good while it was open. Now has closed.

2,"I visited Sbarro recently, and while the pizza was good, the overall experience was incredibly disappointing due to the rude and unwelcoming staff. It felt like they were not bothered about the customers at all. The lack of courtesy and hospitality left me feeling uncomfortable and unwelcome. I won‚Äôt be returning to a place where customer service is clearly not a priority."
1,"Really this was one of my worst experiences with Sbarro. This has never happened before with this pizza chain, however this time when we ordered A Chicken Stuffed Pizza for takeaway the Pizza had only 90% bread and 10% filling which made the pizza very dry and made us feel like we were chewing on a piece of bread. I really Expected Better from one of my favourite chains. It was completely not worth the Price.

The ambience is a Food Court on the Ground Floor of the Cinema.

The Service was decent as well."
4,"This outlet is in the sterling theater so the sitting is not of Sbarro but the sitting is shared with other outlets there.
I tried the calzone, cheezy and regular garlic bread and BBQ veg stromboli. Prices are 100,  140, 100 and 190 plus tax respectively.
Both the garlic bread are great and reasonable for the price compared to other chains. It has a burnt garlic taste which is amazing.
The calzone is just a 8inch pizza folded in half, but it's enough to fill up at the prize. It's stuffed with corn onion and capsicum. It's mad with the same dough as the pizzas.
Strombolis are great but little expensive, try Mexican stromboli instead of bbq since bbq is a little sweet.
Staff is friendly and service is quick"
1,"Burnt base. Undercooked base in parts. Bad taste. Both pizza's had no taste. Paneer pizza had no topping and no taste of makhni. No cheese in both pizza's. Waste of money, had to order food again from another outlet."
4,Hi I ordered Tomato Basil & cheese from Sbarro. Well the taste is very good..I personally loved it. You should definitely try it.i will order other pizzas to try.i definitely liked it better than smokin Joe's.. sharing a picture check it..
3,"Visited this place on a weekday, and it was surprisingly empty. The interiors are decent, and the washrooms were clean, which was a plus.

I ordered the chicken biryani, which came with complimentary onions and pickles. However, the biryani was a huge disappointment‚Äîit was just chicken gravy mixed with rice, lacking the authentic aroma and flavor of a proper biryani. The taste was far from what I expected, making the dish quite underwhelming.

Given the high prices, I expected much better quality. Unfortunately, the food did not live up to the mark, and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place. There are definitely better options available for the same price! üëéüèº"
4,"The restaurant serves North Indian dishes having good taste.  Dal Makhani and Lachha  Parantha were too good which can be said truly Punjabi. We also ordered other vegetarian dishes like the starters, veg Manchon soup, mix veg,  paneer dishes etc which were all average in taste. The Coffee was liked by all of us. The service was good and the ambiance soothing. Overall the food was good but not to come with the expectation of getting the taste served in Punjab/ Delhi."
5,"A no frills authentic punjabi restaurant in Ballard estate. It is a very old, iconic Punjabi restaurant in South Mumbai. Food taste is really good. I loved the Rabri.

Ambiance is just wow, very basic but fascinating at the same time. It really gives a vintage feel due to its sheer simplicity."
5,Dilkhush kebab was nice but heavy because of the cheese filling. Masala romali roti was amazing and Amritsari kulcha was also nice but portion size was less
4,"The food was really well prepared. The restaurant has a good vibe and ambience. The crockery and cutlery were also well cleaned. The prices are a bit on the upper side though considering it is almost inching towards the ‚ÄúFine dine‚Äù category. Speaking from the ‚Äúfine dining‚Äù experience, it isn‚Äôt quite there yet, but we all really loved the food."
1,"I place order after giving him my full address i asked how much for pizza on a call he din even reply for price and directly disconnected my call
After that I order the same thing from swiggy, when swiggy person reached there for my dilivery jai ganesh person just turned off the dilivery"
5,Amazing breakfast and uncle is very kind hearted. Must visit!
4,Good and tasty food in budget and value for money.
1,My shop mint road  53  jaiganesh pizza corner
5,Too good and very reasonable
4,"If you‚Äôre craving authentic North Indian flavors in a cozy setting, Farhang Restaurant is a fantastic choice! The food here is rich, flavorful, and cooked to perfection, making it a must-try for anyone in the mood for a hearty meal.

What we tried:
üßÄ Cheese Garlic Naan ‚Äì Soft, fluffy, and bursting with cheesy goodness and a hint of garlic ‚Äì absolutely delicious!
üçó Chicken Seekh Kebab ‚Äì Juicy, tender, and perfectly spiced, these kebabs were a real treat!
üçõ Butter Chicken ‚Äì Rich, creamy, and packed with flavor ‚Äì this is definitely a classic done right!

The service is quick and attentive, and the ambiance is perfect for a relaxed dining experience. The flavors are bold and comforting, making it a great spot for a satisfying meal.

For anyone who loves North Indian cuisine, Farhang Restaurant is a must-visit!

1,Very Oily food. The Oil is floating above the Gravy we had to separate all the oil before eating. We found Chicken piece in Paneer Tikka sabzi. Pathetic service by this Restaurent. Think twice before Ordering or having a dine in here.
1,"I recently visited this restaurant for dinner with my friends, and while the ambience was quite pleasant, the overall experience was disappointing.

Firstly, the staff were incredibly unprofessional and unhelpful. We were expecting at least a basic level of service, but they fell short in every way. Adding to the frustration, the restaurant doesn‚Äôt provide regular water; you have to buy bottled water, and they don't even offer glasses to drink from.

We ordered three chicken dishes, and the portions were surprisingly small. Despite the high prices, the quantity of food left much to be desired. To top it off, several items listed on the menu were unavailable, which was frustrating.

Overall, it has a lot of potential with its nice ambience, but the poor service, lack of basic amenities, and inadequate portions make it hard to recommend. I hope they improve these aspects in the future."
4,The atmosphere is good but the taste is ok.. Service is the worst.. we are here for team lunch.. we like the atmosphere but we don't like service..very poor service..
3,"Well the place is quiet good and specially good with ambience & service part. As I ordered chicken chilly gravy one, there was so much oil in that which I don‚Äôt like that at all. They just only remove that oil from that and did not change it ."
3,"I recently ordered from this pizza shop and was quite disappointed. The pizza lacked flavor and was almost tasteless. The garlic bread was also subpar, with a dry and bland taste. For the price, I expected much better quality. While I can't speak for the non-veg pizzas, the overall experience was underwhelming. Given the cost, I was expecting a much more satisfying meal. Sadly, I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon."
3,"I tried the pizza with chicken.  Even though it was a hot summer day, the air conditioning was on when I placed my purchase.

Smoking Joe was never one of my favourites.  Although there are undoubtedly better options available, if you prefer to try this modest business, it was decent for Change.

I only tried it to modify the flavour on my palate.

I spent about 400 rs on it. It is good, in my opinion.If my memory is accurate, they did not provide the opportunity to pay with a credit card. We are really grateful for the upi payment option."
4,"This outlet is the first outlet I specially visited coz I normally used to order from them. The ambiance is friendly and nice. The menu were bit greasy but hygiene was maintained well.
I had cheese garlic bread which was good in taste 4/5
And the pizza we ordered was sweet n spicy chicken pizza but i was a bit disappointed because i was not served the exact pizza i order. I usually always used to have that same pizza whenever I ordered but today the pizza or the sauces were different and wasn‚Äôt tasting like normal sweet n spicy pizza. But apart from than pizza was delicious too! Had a great time and this place is recommended for hangouts with friends or having family pizza time. Great experience overall."
1,"So, I would like to direct suggest. There is another pizza shop next to this outlet. Visit there.
Cz smokin Joe's are dishonest chain. No reply on reported issues on mail. It present them careless and unvaluable service, They serve bacha kucha item or whatever they prepared already. Rather coustomrs order.
I had many time order from smoking Joe's bt this outlet has crossed limits."
5,"Wondering to have some delicious pizza. This is the place where u can have those. They have variety of pizza and garlic bread.

The ambience of the place is quiet good and silent. The staff of the place is polite and helpfull. I spend 3 hrs at the place with my friend dint feel bored at all.

I have tried garlic bread and bbq pizza. They were delicious in the taste. The topping done on the pizza was good. Size of the pizza was also good.

Will suggest to visit this place with family and friends as the place is quiet good and silent.

Staff- üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü

Food - üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü"
5,The food I tasted here is awesome and pocket friendly means if ur are hungry and u want to eat healthy food so visit Anand paratha house.
4,"The parathas are tasty and of good quality. Quite cheap in price and good enough in quantity. The atmosphere of the place might not that be good but it is favorable option if you want to have fulfilling parathas in good price. Service is quite moderate. It took around 10 minutes to come. I've ordered Aloo Paneer Paratha.
Their Paneer Bhurji sabzi is average. Consider going for Parathas. They are good."
5,"Over all really good place to have parathas, they really have varieties of paratha, chesse parathas also have sufficient cheese and not so cheesy to over power the taste. Really good food."
5,"Recently, I had the pleasure of visiting Anand Pratha House, and it was a fantastic experience! The food was absolutely delicious, with each dish prepared to perfection. The flavors were authentic, and the service was top-notch, making the overall dining experience truly memorable. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great meal and a wonderful ambiance."
5,"These parathas ü´ì were so good‚Äîcomforting and flavorful, just like home-cooked food. And the price üí∞ was super affordable. Highly recommend."
2,"The only cake I have seen over and over again is the black forest. The shop is loaded with black forest cake. Hardly seen any kind of variety in this shop. The other stuffs like puff and cutlets not fresh, taste like leftover.
This is the only cake shop in our area that must be the reason people have no other choice but to take cake from here.
Disappointing"
1,"The shop is mostly closed, the old man is kinda rude, no variety, and cake taste like leftovers.
That's why I always go to sector 15 Monginis to get some service"
1,This Cake shop has been permanently closed now. You can find monginis cake shop in Sector 15 belapur
4,Great place to buy cakes savouries and stuff for birthday parties location is Prabhat centre opp best bus depot
3,Quality is not up to the mark as expected from bran like monginis.
1,I went to this outlet of dominos around 2-3 weeks ago and I realised it has worsened alot than before as the service was worst I experienced server down on 9/10 visits whether be takeaway or dine in and had to order online and the main experience I wanted to share is that this time I went to get the chicken meat balls take away and again I had to order them online as usual they reasoned that server is down and after on 3mins later other 2 customers arrived and the girl making pizza came and took their order normally and I was surprised and I asked her why did she made me do it online ? She started rudely speaking about it's not my concern the server sometimes work n sometimes not and for my order she didn't even try and when I conveyed this to her then she reasoned that they were less on staff but they were having 2 people making pizza and 4 people around the counter so they started to control the situation when I was asking about my order being online nd the other customers normally. Okay it didn't end over here but I had to wait around 25 mins just for the chicken meat balls and once I asked her about how much time it'll take them the girl who was rude earlier and also making pizza came and rudely answered can't you wait lil bit we are busy and this was about waiting for 20 min then asking and after 5 mins I received the order. This outlet of Domino's has really worsened.
1,"Review 2 years ago : Quality Dropped. Bad Customer Service.
Update after 2 years : Not sure how they managed to get even worse. Ordered 2 pizzas, 1 wrong item delivered and both pizzas received are burnt. Store is unresponsive. No accountability!"
3,This Domino's has been there for very very long in Belapur. Situated just next to Cafe Coffee Day. The interiors have gone shabby because it is already 8-9 years old. Other than that during the pandemic they haven't been accepting orders over the counter. All the orders have been placed via their website. Wont say that the staff are friendly. But they arent rude either. Given the way they make their pizza it is inconsistent at best. On somedays it is soft moist and tasty. On some days it is like I'm biting a stale hard and dry pizza.i
5,Nice place topping and cheese was so fresh and pizza was also hot and tasty
3,"Fast delivery, but their garlic breads and pizzas seem to be hitting the bottom rock. But nevertheless.. Good rescue for the late night hungry stomachs."
3,"Last Sunday 9th feb,2025, we visited Navratna Hotel in Seawoods. It's a premium hotel that feels like a South Indian place but also has options for Gujarati food, attracting a Gujarati crowd. We ordered a cheese dosa, a veg grill sandwich, and masala buttermilk. Surprisingly, the cheese dosa had whole cheese cubes Inside that weren't melted or grated, so I asked them to replace it with plain dosa instead and didn't charge for it, only for the cheese dosa. The sandwich was just okay, and the masala buttermilk was so spicy that I couldn't drink it. The service was slow; we had to repeatedly ask them to refill our water glasses and clean the table. The hotel was quite empty when we arrived. Despite these issues, the ambiance was good and it's a decent option in the area."
1,"The restaurant looks good from the outside. It is spacious but the food quality was awful. We ordered two dishes which had similar gravy and the taste wasn't good. Felt like they added too much salt in the dishes.

The atmosphere was terrible. It was noisy and loud. Too much disturbance. It wasn't a pleasant experience for me and my Family"
5,"Navaratna restaurant offers a delightful dining experience with authentic flavors, excellent service, and a warm ambiance. The food is consistently delicious and well-presented‚Äîperfect for both casual meals and special occasions. Highly recommended!"
4,"The food we opted was south Indian. The servers was not aware of details of the food and he had to go and get the captain for any details.
Food quality is good. All served on time and parking is also availble.
They have a good menu and both an ac and non-ac section."
5,"Quick service, clean washrooms,
South Indian food is always fresh during day or night or noon session. Have been visiting this restaurant often I pass by Mumbai and every time the food remains good in taste , oil free and colour free!"
4,Food test really good its a street food so hygiene is not upto mark its serves best chole bhature in seawood üòãüòã
5,Have eaten chole bhature at brijwasi as well but surprisingly this was better & 4x cheaper as well.
5,"Amazing food boletho JHAKAAS! You have to try the chole bature here!!! üòçüòç‚ú®‚ú®

In 45rs you get 2 Bature and good amount of Chole!"
5,"A moving Thela...
Very neat and clean.. of course Chole & Bhature are very tasty..."
5,TOO Good
1,"Ordered for Mother's day Celebration.The Mother's day Cake had hair inside it.
Called the outlet. They said they can't replace as they are very busy.
Our Mother's day celebration was ruined.They asked to send pics. Sent them pics and Video.
Next day Customer care called and apologized and said the money would be refunded via Zomato, the delivery company.
Since then Contacting Store, Customer Care and Zomato. Net Result is Zero.
Wouldn't have posted here if at least the complaint resolution had been good."
5,The pastry is very tasty that's too under rs100 chocolate pastry is also good
5,"Same perfect cakes since past 15 yeats.
Perfect ambience and friendly staff"
4,"Had ordered a birthday cake in a football shape. Shape and colour combinations were great, however taste could jave been better.
Anyways, since my son was happy so paisa wasool!!"
5,Cake are best at every type nd snack also less money nd good tasty snack I just like this place to have quick snacks
5,The food range and variety was excellent for a cafe. The only issue was with this mushroom crepe that we ordered. I would suggest increasing the stuffing to crepe ratio but apart from that it was amazing. The beverages were also well prepared. Staff service was top notch and very welcoming. Would definitely visit again :)
4,"Have been to this place multiple times, and never been dissapointed. Food is always as per my palate. Since I am more of an instant coffee guy, I cant really comment on the coffee served. But my friends have always rated it highly. My wife tried a Cafe Mocha, which she liked a lot."
5,"We found a cosy cafe for you in Seawoods - Olde Baileys

It‚Äôs the perfect place for a coffee break or a hearty meal

You‚Äôll get a variety of food options here like salads, starters, sandwiches, pastas, spaghettis and more

And for beverages you can try their coffees, milkshakes, ice teas, mocktails

We loved their zesty nut hot chocolate which has been recently launched along with other flavours

The ambience here is aesthetic and they have an indoor & outdoor seating

They‚Äôll be completing 10 years in January so watch out for some special 10th anniversary offers

Every moment spent here is going to be memorable!"
5,"Well Olde Bailey's is one of the oldest caffe in Navimumbai,The coffe here is amazing specially mocha and Irish coffe, This place sometimes turns into workstation for their regular customer,As they have very specific menu on the list but all are topnotch try their Fried chicken, Grilled chicken with garlic pepper sauce,sicillian pizza, spinach corn cheese balls,chicken patte on toast ,It is my go to place highly recommend is their mud cake you will fall on it"
5,Really good chicken club sandwich and Mango slushy. Must try.
1,"I had purchased 3 butterscotch pastries. But, the pastries were all stale. The bread was too hard and taste was bad. NOT RECOMMENDED.

Also, never ever going to this shop again."
5,The most old and trusted brand Monginis there will be a lot of cake shops nowadays but no one comes close to this. A great cake shop tƒ±ll yet
1,"Purchased plum cake, tooo much cinnamon powder, and dry no any plum pieces in that..
Same day purchased chocolate cake and chocolate chips cake too, after 2 day's got fungus in that......I think no any quality and test likes first we found theirüòèüëéüëévery disappointedüëé"
1,"OMG! The worst experience ever!!!!!!!  First of all they gave us an expired cake and the cream inside was so sour I just can't express it with my words. And when we confronted them the ego of the guy was greater than his height. Guys NEVER EVER GO HERE, GO TO SOME OTHER BRANCH OR SOMETHING.  Wasted my money for this."
1,"The worst place with the worst staff, i brought a cake for my mom , and the cake turned out to be expired , and when we confronted them then man was so rude to us even talked politely to him he was showing unnecessary attitude to us , please don't visit these specific branch guys, I'm their regular customer and they treated me like this imagine how will they treat others . I would like to give them rating in minus infinity. I literally spend my savings on this ."
1,"Kindly check the Order and Amount with the GST Invoice and they cheat with Order Qty and Amount.
Charged 650 instead of Invoice 648.48 without our knowledge.
It's not matter for INR 1.5 but they fooling us, Dominos,
No clean, no hygiene maintained

Just give a check, the lady preparing Pizza her hand is not clean. She prepares with a bare uncleaned hand..."
1,"I recently visited Domino‚Äôs and had a Veg Extravaganza Cheese Burst pizza. The taste was okay, but the overall experience was quite disappointing. The ambience was not good at all‚Äîhygiene was a major issue. The place didn‚Äôt feel clean, and the washroom was in terrible condition.

The service was equally bad. The staff, especially the lady at the counter, seemed least interested in taking orders or assisting customers.

With such poor hygiene and unprofessional service, I would not recommend dining in here. In fact, I wouldn't suggest eating here at all due to these serious cleanliness and customer service issues. Definitely not worth it!"
4,"They serve your favorite Dominos pizzas .
The place is decent to spend time with your family.
You have a view of the kitchen and you can actually see your pizza being made.
There is a parking space as well.
You should definitely try their cheese burst pizza if you love cheese
I personally love their thin crust pizzas as they aren't too heavy.
You should also try their zingy parcels and Tacos.
I won't recommend any of their deserts.
Choco lava cake is a popular one though"
1,"i had a very terrible experience with this particular dominos outlet.  i ordered pizza and it literally takes 35 min to get my food. the pouch of oregano and chilli was missing, no print copy of bill was given. and the worst part is attitude of employee and the way they treated humans after asking any query.. the order was soggy and in very bad condition. toppings mentioned on menu was also missing, there was only lot of corn topping.. they serve garlic bread as a bread only. no taste. as per the policy , no single employee was seems to follow hygiene rules . no hand gloves use nothing.. it takes 15 min to clean the table, no words for washroom mess.. i wont be visiting or ordering food from here again. very bad experience"
1,"I had a terrible experience with the Domino's Pizza in Kharegaon, Kalwa. I ordered a pizza, and the manager informed me it would take one and a half hours for the food to arrive. This is already an unacceptable waiting time, but what made it worse was the manager's extremely rude behavior. His language was unprofessional and disrespectful, which is not what I expect from a well-known brand like Domino's.

To make matters worse, the food arrived cold and soggy, clearly showing that it had been sitting out for a while before being delivered. The whole experience was highly disappointing. I've attached a picture of the manager to ensure this issue is addressed. Domino's needs to seriously reconsider their staff training and improve their service standards. I won't be ordering from this outlet again, and I advise others to avoid it as well."
4,Test is good and any  one dish of rice is enough for two persons. Fry noodles are yumm..
5,"Good in taste and quality, Perfect in quantity, you can customize ur order like no onions or garlic and they accept it. Good packing too. Must go place/order food from Noodle Box"
3,This place is pretty average. The food is not great but the prices are abit high. Not worth the price.
5,"awesome chinese ....
dont expect old normal chinese, he has something different n delicious for us ....
completely delighted ....."
5,Absolutely nice place to try a really good chinese food
5,"The most beautiful Modaks i've ever seenüòç High quality sweets, i absolutely love this place. The moment you walk in, you get lost & mesmerized by the variety of mithais & various snacks.
Their Motichur Ladoo & Boondi Ladoos are simply the best!
Pricey but great taste, it's worth itüòãüòã"
5,One of the reputed sweet and confectionery shops in Thane serving wide range ofquality products.
5,"It is the best Chain for sweets in Thane.
The sweets here do not taste too sugary.
They serve a range of sweets.
You should try their kalakand and mango barfi.
The Bengali sweets are very good as well.
The Chat they have here is great their Chole Tikki and Dahi Wada are highly recommended
Their savouries are decent as well.
The cost of course will be higher than all the places around."
4,"It is a seafood restaurant, wonderful for people looking for konkani/malvani cuisines. Ambience is inspired by typical konkan houses. Best starter to go with is fish fingers. Chinese and other dishes are quite average. Staff is kind but yet a professionalism would be appreciated. Service can be faster. Overall had a great experience. Best pick for family time. Visit the place for dinner for a pleasing environment."
2,"Highly overpriced... Average taste
Nothing special in chat items.
Tastes very average."
4,Ribbons & balloon cakes are best compared to all other brands. I have purchased cake several times from this store. People working here are polite and eager to help. Do try their hot brownie which just melts in the mouth. Chocolate pastries are just love. They have a variety of cakes and they keep launching new flavours every 2-3 months.
1,"Third class shop, they sold the expire pastry to me, I have checked that after reaching home I live in dombiwali"
1,Worst experience....dont buy cake from ribbons & ballons ...we found a big hair in cake...
1,"Bought a premium birthday cake and after cutting(at home) it tasted as if it was rotten. Immediately it was brought to the attention of local store in kalwa(during shop closing hours), with the remaining cake of it for them to taste.

The shopkeeper said the cake was handed over to me in good condition during purchase and rotting took place at the customer's end due to lack of necessary care. However, informed the cake was only 30 mints out of the fridge(10 mints travelling and 20 mints before cutting) and was in well packed condition.

I informed store not to provide me a refund nor I asked for another cake, I just wanted to highlight this to the RB team to avoid recurrence that could create unnecessary health issues.

Unfortunately, the shopkeeper hesitated to raise the complaint form and started criticizing blaming me  which was most unexpected and saddening part, maybe he was in a hurry to close the store and leave for his home.

Later, I had no choice but to leave the cake at store with the incomplete complaint form(left incomplete due to the rude & arrogant behaviour of the store keeper). However, during the discussion with the store - observed that they switched-off their fridge at Night hours, may be to control electricity bills and eventually leading to rotting of these cakes.

With no support from the store I had to put a review on the internet for people to see and understand that, maybe RB(kalwa) does not care about its customer health. Therefore, suggest all dear customers to check product quality at such shops(if feasible) itself before purchasing to avoid any serious health issues. Secondly, suggest RB(kalwa) staff/owner to check their staff behaviour and quality of products before selling them, as you may jeopardize your valued customers health.
Rest I prefer leaving to people decision."
5,I‚Äôve tried this for the first time. There‚Äôs many types of cakes shown on display at any time of the day here. Amazing taste. Quality was so good ! Absolutely loved it. Easily the best baker in the area. Cake was very fluffy and soft. The pastries are a delicacy for real. Amazing variety. Absolutely lovely taste. I shop from here for every occasion in my house. And everyone loves cake whether there‚Äôs an occasion or not.
3,The restaurant is on good location. Having good varieties of South Indian food. Staff is nice and supportive. Fast order and fast delivery. There are some things which I don't like. The food was okay not so great as I expected. Prices are okay because it's inside the mall.
4,"R-mall is located on the ever busy Ghodbunder road, near Manpada area. Being away from the densely populated residential localities results in less footfalls at the mall. One may find the place deserted most of the time. So many of shops are closed. But this gloomy ambience should not spoil your shopping experience. As many good options for shopping are available in the mall. In the basement is the paid parking lot. On the top floor is the food court and amusement centre for kids. Evening onwards it's difficult to reach to the Mall due to increased traffic..."
3,"There are few good stores, but still not the best. Architectural design of the mall is not good, after entering the mall you not feel waoo..
It feels like it's was made for some commercial complex than converted into mall.
And now few stores also closed..."

4,"Nice place to visit for shopping, eating and studying (Crossword). This place has everything from small shops having decorative items to large shopping centres such as More Megastore, Croma , Brand Factory and much more. It has KFC, MCD and it's own food court."
5,"Best place for big family dinner or lunch. Very nice place. veri big. very nice atmosphere. Live music. Very old hotel. Best place for family and friends. Very nice quality in quantity. Very nice test. Must try kabab, tandoori and mutton handi. Superb test. Play area for kids. Visit once with your family. Very helpful and supportive staff."
3,"We visited for a birthday celebration and had an okay experience, but it could have been better. We ordered a couple of starters, including Chicken Pahadi Kabab and Chicken Lollipop, but both were drier than usual, and the meat was quite chewy. The ambiance was decent, but the table and chairs were not in the best condition‚Äîthey even had to add support to the table.

There was live singing, which added to the atmosphere, but it was a bit too loud at times. However, the artist was kind enough to dedicate a birthday song for our friend, which was a nice touch.

Overall, the experience was average. Given the name and the reviews, we expected a bit more.

3,I order dilkhush kebab bombil fry and mutton biryani which was ok in taste I think this could be more better according to the price sitting are was good I think they should improve their food quality
3,"Food is good, but it's very very noisy.
They have some fountains in there, they make soooooo much noise.
Also I think they don't have any AC sitting."
4,"Good place for visit and making parties, it's a simple type place and open garden view and having marriage hall."
5,"Nice place inside Rustumjee' A,B,C wings complex. Their placement is such that it doesn't get easily noticed. They should put their nameplate at a better place which will make them more visible..an easel stand with their branding put outside might help. Inside they have 4-5 chairs for seating. Great choices of icecream flavors."
1,"Just visited their outlet. All Ice cream was in a melted state. They were scooping out ice cream from their tins in the most unhygienic way. Literally using their unwashed hands. As the tin ice cream was hard, it slipped out and fell on a dirty tray. They put it back on the cone and offered us. When we objected - plainly said sorry. A so called premium ice cream outlet with the most unhygienic staff. Sad!"
4,A very tiny ice cream shop at A wing of Azziano Block at Rustomjee Urbania.  There is seating just enough for a few people.  So it is better to buy ice creams and head out of this parlour. They have all of their flavours stocked and also provide family packs that are value for money.  They do make and serve milk shakes they are known for.  Their speciality is their hand churned ice cream that is more creamy. Their fruit ice cream is sold based on season as they use fresh fruit.  They supply salt and chilly mix that goes well with their guava ice cream.  That one is a must try.
5,I ate Panipuri & guava flavour. One of the best ice cream parlour. Now this will come always first in my list. Paisa-vasool + innovation of ice creams. Must Must try. Definitely you will not disappoint.
4,"A good place to enjoy ice-creams. This chain of ice-cream parlor has come up everywhere in Mumbai and Thane. The variety are similar to Naturals. Kids like the oreo flavor. Adults like vanilla and tender coconut. There are lot of other options. Small scoop is ‚Çπ60, Medium ‚Çπ85 large ‚Çπ110. The place is clean. Staff helpful. It's open till 12 midnight."
3,"Monginis is a well-known brand in cakes and pastries segment. This franchise located in Vitawa (Thane Belapur Rd) They are having huge range of cakes. You can find here typical bakery products like cakes, pastries, muffins, sweet rolls, veg- nonveg stuffed patis etc. We have ordered cakes so many times from here. Good taste and quality. They deliver orders at home. Staff is so customer friendly. I guess they all are family members thats the secret may be behind successful cake shop. Place is little small. You can't seat and eat things inside or outside there. They accept cash-card payments."
1,"Worst experience. We had taken half kg cake for my birthday from this shop. At the time of purchasing the cake they told us that this is fresh cake came from bakery today only. We invited some friends and relatives for my birthday. And aftercutting the cake we realized that cake was not fresh. It felts spongy and taste was salty and not sweet. My all celebration mood was gone because of this cake. After that we just throw that cake and gone in cake shop with a peace of cake and show them that cake was not fresh. They also realize that cake was not fresh but still keep on saying that cake is fresh u are not understanding the taste. After so much argument they give us small cake as a compensation. But it was useless because all of my friends and other guest gone without eating cake on that birthday.
Really my that birthday becomes worst because of the cake from this monginous shop.

Reply came after 3 years. It shows what kind of service and priority you are giving to your valuable customers"
1,"Worst cake. They forced to buy rasmalai cake when asked for pineapple cake . Cake had chocolate base inside while rasmalai always has vanilla base, the rasmalai on top was stinking and there were little insects inside. The cake was hard as rock and it was too old. When called for complain they said it was fresh and can‚Äôt help u without the return of the cake. We took the cake to a party and it was such a bad experience. Monginis being a good brand we decided to stop by for a cake but the experience was worst. Don‚Äôt  buy from here‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt serve fresh cakes."

1,"I go to this McDonald's branch a lot. Although the personnel is kind and responsive to your order, I am disappointed with the quality of the meal. Overall, I am satisfied with the service. One of the two Mac chicken burgers I bought had rotting lettuce in it. I have to discard it since the taste and smell are so horrible that I nearly puked. I'm not criticizing any of the employees; rather, I'm saying that the food ought to be of the highest caliber because when we order from Mac Donald's, people come expecting high standards of quality and hygiene."
5,"Best what they offer.
Staff was courteous, food was standard so does coffee.

Dont like fast food now but had some work near by hence need to have something quick."

5,"Since last 2.5 years this place is satisfying my hunger 100%.
Every time I visit this place I feel nice and grateful. The food they serve is truly 'Satwik' .
The Nair family operating this is also very welcoming. It's not just food, it's a homely experience :) .
One of the reasons why I love my stay in Vrindavn Society."
5,"One of the most underrated breakfast joint in the neighborhood. Are you looking for lip smacking Idli sambar or vada sambar along with nice coffee? Head to Satvik poli Bhaji kendra.

We love the Tandoori Chicken leg piece. It is good ONLY if freshly made the same day. Try not to get old stock.
Best time is during Ramadan, as food gets depleted, so stock is fresh.
Kheeri is also lovely.
Mutton roll is good if fried well and crisp.
I prefer this place to Delhi Zaika which is opposite as service is much better. This is my personal choice."

3,Great Vegeterian cakes. Also have a lot of snack variety.
5,"This store is one of the best places to buy bakery items , specially cakes in this area. They have lots of flavours and designs to offer. They also make photo and customized cakes as per customer needs. The staff is polite.The entrance is ‚ôø accessible. You get cakes , pastries, cupcakes , wafers and pastry puffs here. They also take birthday cake and party orders. The service is quick and prices are moderate. The quality of cake is good. The shop is small and clean. They do home delivery too via delivery partners."
1,Sell Cream cake by saying as soft chocolate
5,Have been visiting this shop since I wasa child. And it's always been a delight since then. The staff too hasn't changed and are as warm and welcoming as they were 20 years ago! Simply love this place

2,Ordered A Cheese volcano paradise and this was the condition of the pizza when it was delivered. Soo disappointing. Can't even complain on the app or call the store as the store's cell is switched off. We don't accept this from dominos pizza. The delivery agent kept declining our call. Very dissatisfied. Would rate the delivery in negative if possible.
4,"Domino's Pizza offers a convenient and satisfying experience for pizza lovers. Their menu features a wide variety of pizzas, from classic options to innovative specialty pies. The crust is typically well-balanced, and the toppings are fresh and generously applied. The online ordering system is user-friendly, and delivery is generally quick and efficient. While it may not be gourmet, Domino's provides a reliable and tasty option for a casual meal."
1,"Very bad condition of the store ,no air conditioning working ! Staff is not behaving properly with the customers"
4,"Whenever I have cravings for pizza, I land on Dominos. Pizzas are so great here. The crispy crust, the cheesy layer and the yummy toppings! The cheese burst is my all time favourite.
The Burger Pizza, Garlic bread and Choco Lava cake is delicious as well.

Overall I love Dominos and will always do."
1,"Lot of toppings for a change. Very hot pizzas delivered ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Zero pizza sauce for Rs 549 pizza. Unbelievable.
And these feedbacks don't count for dominos. They keep increasing prices and not deliver what they market."
3,"I recently visited this restaurant and ordered the Pamplet Thali, which cost me ‚Çπ610. The taste was good, but considering the price, it felt a bit expensive, and the quantity was also on the smaller side. However, it's worth trying for authentic Malvani flavors.

We also tried a Chinese combination of rice and noodles, which was decent, but I would recommend sticking to their Malvani dishes for the best experience.

The seating arrangement is nice and cozy, making it an ideal spot for families. Overall, it's worth trying this place at least once for its Malvani cuisine"
5,"Had an amazing experience at Sai Vijaydurg last weekend with my office friends. The ambience created a perfect setting, and the service was exceptional. A must-visit for a delightful culinary and dining experience! The place is located at Gokul Nagar, Majiwada which is at epicentre lf Thane.

The non-veg thali was an absolute delight, bursting with flavors.
I tried Surmai thali (5/5) which just exceeded my expectations. The perfectly cooked Surmai fish, accompanied by a variety of flavorful sides, showcased culinary excellence. The freshness and quality of ingredients were evident, making it a delightful seafood dining experience. Highly recommended for seafood enthusiasts!

Chicken Malvani Thali (5/5) is a true delight for chicken lovers. The assortment of well-spiced chicken dishes, paired with flavorful sides, creates a satisfying and authentic dining experience. The generous portions and diverse flavors make it a top choice for those craving a hearty and delicious chicken feast.

Veg65 (5/5)- Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, each bite is bursting with flavorful spices. The perfect balance of textures and the enticing blend of spices make it a must-try.

The staff were well trained and provided exceptional service. Their attentiveness and friendliness elevated the overall dining experience. From prompt assistance to genuine smiles, the service was impeccable. Kudos to the staff for making our visit memorable with their outstanding hospitality.

PS: You can directly order at your home or office from the hotel itself with free delivery."
5,"The Best authentic Malvani restaurant in Thane.¬†the interior is very pleasant and best for family and friends. We tried mocktails,¬†Thali is best and must try.we tried Promfret Thali and Surmai Thali, i like Masala papad , Prawns koli wada is okay because it's very oily. Test is good,  Service is good üëçTHANK YOU üôè"
5,"Malvani food has been always my favorite and I always look out for authentic seafood.
This place has ben revamped and reopened after 6 months and now it turned out into such an amazing pace for delicious Malvani delicacies.

What I triedüëá
Pomfret Thali
Bhangda Thali

Easy to go with thalis as you get everything in one.Not as many varities in a thali as the other places serve but I just loved the taste more than anywhere else.Too good especially the fish curry tastes the best..Fish fry is another best thing one must try.
They also chinese and other varities so I wanted to try Chicken Hot Garlic.
The presentation was impressive.
By the way so many varities even in each Tgali like they have even chicken and mutton Liver Thali which is rare in other outlets.
.
.
Service is quick and the staff is always on their toes to serve you.
.
.
Unique thing was their modern technology of transferring the food from the first floor kitchen to the ground floor seating through a lift that saves the staff from going up and down 100 times a day.Impressed to see this.
.
.
A staff also expressed about the relief to me.Soooo good.
.
.
Must visit if you a Malvani or non veg food lover."
5,It's quite a good place for malwani seafood. It's more tasty than other coastal seafood hotels I tried.
5,"Absolutely loved my experience at Preeti Sandwich Center!

The staff was incredibly polite and helpful, making the visit even more pleasant. We ordered a chili cheese sandwich, rose falooda, and peach iced tea all of which were absolutely delicious.

The flavors were spot-on and truly exceeded our expectations.

The seating area, though a bit small, had a cute and cozy vibe, adding to the charm of the place. It‚Äôs definitely a local gem worth visiting.

Amazing food, great service, and a lovely atmosphere‚Äîhighly recommended!"
1,"Today, on 1st May '25,we ordered 4 normal veg sandwich + 3 Sev Puri to Waghbil outlet.
It took 2.15hours to delivery this order just 150 metres away to Cosmos Park.
Such pathetic service is highly unacceptable.
If u see the order log receipt the order placed on 8.43pm on whatsapp but was logged at 10.08pm in system.
We understand that on holidays there is huge rush but at such times orders should not be accepted at all.
This is my 2nd experience with Waghbil outlet of Preeti Sandwich.
I will never ever order from Preeti Sandwich in future."
4,"Famous place in Thane for Mumbai style masala toast and sandwiches. My friend Meet introduced me to the masala toast, and it was lovely! The smearing of green and red chutney on top took it to another level. Apparently, this shop has multiple outlets, rightfully so since more ppl need this goodness in their lives."
5,"This is the outlet of Famous Preeti sandwich near talao pali. The food and juice served here is awesome. They take care of hygeine , service is also fast. But the only thing which needs to be taken care is that they keep the dustbin for garbage just in front of the place where people sit for eating which is not a pleasant experience. Other than that this is a place to visit anytime when you crave something to eat or drink. The chili mili toast sandwich is a must try with the mango milk shake with ice cream and mango pieces in the summer season."
3,"Reason for 3 star ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê ordered Paneer Cheese Lehsuni sandwich which is one of the recommended sandwich,but you have to pay Rs 200 which is on higher side..."
4,"This restaurant is usually packed with all the college goers and youngsters. You will find literally everyone sitting here to eat Franky. Other than that it serves chinese, Indian. Chinese is good here with minimal quantity but decent quality. I mostly have chicken & mayonnaise franky from here and sometimes chinese food. Affordable prices for everything."
1,Food might be good here but the attitude of the guys might result in a early closure of this place. Placed a order from zomato online ordering at 12:20pm and waited till 2:20pm and I kept calling the mobile number given on the site but the person at the other end kept disconnecting it
4,Good place for quick chinese/non veg food
3,Not good not bad place. Food taste is average.

5,"It's the best restaurant in market. Reasonable rates. They also keep fasting food on their specific days like sankshti and other. Their menu have extreme varities of food. It's a veg hotel but food tastes amazing. If you're out for shopping and felt hungry in the middle then visit this place once. We have tried cheese pav bhaji, sabudana wada, misal pav and a grilled sandwich. Thalipith is also their speciality."

4,"Great food , slow service, smoking allowed. Chicken lolipop not recommended as it smelled .. chicken maratha is good. AC section is stuffy due to smoking and roof section is noisy due to traffic as it's next to the highway. Easy on pockets"
3,"Shady bar. They allow ppl to smoke in AC section, so it becomes a hot box and you tend to inhale a lot of passive smoke. So much that even your clothes start stinking of smoke"

They also have good range of bakery products and also their in house brand's potato wafers are amongst the best one can get in terms of quality. Coming to the cakes off late they have introduced a lot of varieties in their line up but personally my favourite has always been almond dutch cake/ pastery."
1,"Disappointed with the quality**
I just bought two Devil‚Äôs Delight pastries, and the taste and quality were terrible‚Äîcompletely deteriorated. I even asked the staff if they were fresh, but they turned out to be dry and nowhere near as good as other cake shops. Definitely not worth the money. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying from here unless you want to waste yours on bad-quality cakes."
5,"Bought Dutch Chocolate Cake, it was good. But the sponge was dry. Chocolate lovers will definitely love it. The outlet offers cakes in different sizes. Besides usual cakes, the outlet also offers variety of items like  pastries, savoury items like Samosa, Pattice, Pizza, Rolls, Burgers, etc, snack items like wafers, toast, khari, etc and miscellaneous items like fruit/vanilla cake, pizza base, burger buns, etc. The owner & the staff is very helpful & courteous."

Today i ordered Chicken Manchow Soup from this hotel, and to my shock, I found a fungus-like substance in the noodles. This was absolutely disgusting and unacceptable. Due to the lack of hygiene, I decided to return the entire order.

Food quality and cleanliness are essential for any restaurant, but it's clear that this place does not care about either. I informed the staff immediately, but their response was careless and lacked any sense of responsibility.

Such negligence can seriously endanger customers' health. I will never visit this place again and strongly advise others to stay away from it as well."
5,"Place is particularly good for quantity and quality of food. Good service and also great delivery . They take the orders as told and also take care of the customisations asked for.

We tried chicken dum kebab which i personally like it which was juicy as opposed to other kebabs which may be dry at times. The preparation is very similar to a dum biryani.

Also we tried chicken nawabi in gravy which was also good."
1,"Worst restaurant experience ever. There are two sections ‚Äî one for bachelors and another for families. But the bachelor section is in terrible condition, more like a shady local bar than a proper dining area. Shockingly, a waiter admitted that the same food served in the family section upstairs is also served here. To make things worse, I saw cockroaches and even rats. So please, be cautious! The family section may look fancy, but it‚Äôs all just for show."

3,Food is nice in terms of quality and quantity. The taste has changed drastically over the period of time.The owner should work on the ambience and ventilation as its very suffocating inside seating area and the fans are installed randomly anywhere but not above the tables. Orders are taken promptly and food is served hot on the tables which is appreciated. Prices are very high as compared to the ambience and seating arrangements. Chicken Lollypop were fried crispy and tasted delicious but only 6 pieces available in a full plate which is highly overpriced. Chicken chilly's quantity was generous and tasted yummy. Triple rice portion was served generously in a huge bowl more than sufficient for 2 persons but the gravy was bland and watery. The major plus point is that no or very less artificial food colour is used in some preparations. Schezwan sauce and fry noodles are chargeable @‚Çπ30. A highly overpriced place with respect to ambience and üí∫ arrangements.
5,"Best Chinese restaurant in kalwa
Best quality Chinese food and quantity as well.
Staff was so humble and sweet.
Neat and Clean floor and ambiance.
Ambience is also good.
Affordable rates.
Thankyou"
5,"Awesome food...
Authentic Chinese...
No one can beat there's lolypop...."
4,"Good typical chinese place, it's a very old place in the area and holds loyal consumers, good food, quality is not top-notch but hey it's chinese. Overall good ambience too, for those days when u need cheap chinese with that glass bottle sodas."
5,Delicious Food. Quality and Quantity is also amazing. Affordable price of each item. Must try dish is all the menu.ü§§üòãüòÄ
4,The starters and soups are very tasty both veg and non veg but the fried rice is a hit or miss. Sometimes it tastes very good but sometimes the rice is meh.
1,I have ordered paneer chilli and noodles the paneer is duplicate paneer it taste like Maida or corn flour don't order from this restaurant ordered first time very pathetic experience
4,"Taste is authentic and hygiene is taken care of Everything.
Unique Flavors in every dish they have.
Should Visit for every craving but only for vegetarians"
1,"I tried chicken hongkong roll which costed me 60/- INR
They took almost 20+ minutes to prepare my order ( it was 10:30PM & there were hardly 2 customers apart of me)
Roll was pathetic..
1)they didn‚Äôt fried or warm the base/roti at all
2) cabbage they add was too thick
3) chicken was not adequately hot

Overall,
it‚Äôs not worth it at all"
4,
2,Ordered chicken white tikka (parcel) for ‚Çπ190. Taste and flavour was good but the chickens outer layer was pretty hard and chewy. Hygiene is a very big concern as the area near tandoor was dirty. Finding a parking place could be a major task as the restaurant is situated on the main road in a busy market place.
4,"Service could get improved.
The quality and quantity are good.
Gravy is also superb.
Must try if you are nearby"
1,Those who want to take sick leave on Monday can have chinese on Sundays from this chinese corner‚Ä¶You will definitely 1000% get sick after eating there 1year fermented chicken (taste like leather and can‚Äôt swallow after chewing more than 36 times).You will personally experience this after eating there chicken.  Doctors of Kalwa and Kharigaon should thank This kind of Chinese corner who help them in increasing patient line. Thank you ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è Hope this remarks stays there who want to taste ancient chicken leather üôèüèºüéâ
3,"Delicious Indian Chinese food but very unhygienic and unhealthy. So choice is yours :)

If you like healthy food then this is not the place for you. They have very tasty Indian Chinese dhabha style but very unhygienic and dirty kitchen, so you can imagine how healthy the food here is going to be. I love the taste of food from Nandu Chinese so it's one of my go to place when I want to have Chinese food. I have been having Chinese here since 10-15 years. The time taken from order to delivery is very high so I would advise to place your orders early or you will end up having dinner super late. I will reiterate not healthy food at all and very oily too."
4,Nonveg starters are delicious
5,The experience was very good of kalwa Subway Store. The morning leady is very helpful for me.she is suggested the new product of hot and chesey. The leady is very beautiful smile in face and Store also is maintain the cleanliness..
1,"The service is very bad. They told us to wait 5mins for our order, Previous customer was taking her order so we waited for that, then more new customers come to take their orders. The Subway staff started taking their orders and we were still sitting there that will we get our food, we just ordered a wrap but they didn't gave, they served the other customers first who came after us and we waited for half and hour. Really very poor service, please don't go. Never going back to the Parsik Subway which is newly opened. üò°üò§"
5,"I recently visited the newly opened Subway in Kharegaon, Kalwa, and it was a delightful experience overall.

The outlet is clean and well-organized, with friendly staff who ensure quick service. The food lives up to Subway‚Äôs standards‚Äîfresh, tasty, and customizable. I highly recommend trying their wraps(palak or multigrain); they are perfectly flavorful, and make a great meal option.

However, the one downside is that the seating area is quite limited, making it difficult to sit and enjoy your meal comfortably during peak hours.

Despite this, It‚Äôs a great addition to the neighborhood and a perfect place for a quick, healthy bite."
1,"These outlet don't deserve even a single star.
Recently visited this Subway outlet, expecting the usual quality and service. However, my experience was far from satisfactory

1. Order Issues: I placed an order for two Cheesy Chicken Tikka burgers priced at ‚Çπ299 each. Surprisingly, the staff informed me that they didn‚Äôt have buns available and instead used wraps without any prior consultation

2. Overcharged Bill: To make matters worse, they added cheese as an add-on and charged me ‚Çπ799 for the entire order. This is significantly higher than the expected total, even accounting for the substitution.

3. Incorrect Add-ons: The final bill included charges for four extra cheese add-ons (‚Çπ30 each, totaling ‚Çπ120). However, only two cheese slices were actually included in the wraps.

This combination of poor communication, incorrect billing, and substitution without consent left a bad impression. Subway is known for its transparency and customer-centric approach, but this experience didn‚Äôt align with those values.

I hope Subway addresses such issues promptly to maintain its reputation."
1,"If you want to wait for 25 mins to get the wrong bread with 2 pieces of tomato, cucumber, olives and jalapenos each then this is the Outlet to go. Only after pointing out that this is not the Subway standard, I was told the sub maker was a newbie while the newbie tells me this is the quantity his manager has told him to put in the sandwich. Clearly cheating the customers while killing the brand name. Not eating at this outlet ever again!"
1,"Very arrogant person , they doesn‚Äôt have spoon for eating butter garlic sticks momos . Very unhinged , they put momos all stuff by hand without washing. I don‚Äôt prefer to go their"

The chicken Bao Is really good and chicken dim sums are amazing .
Veg Bao and Veg dimsums were very good as well
They also have very good momos especially their Chicken tikka momos.
They also have decent burgers
U can also get these in combo offers
I liked their subs as well almost as good as the premium ones
Final word : good momos and burgers
But the Dimsums and Bao are highly recommended."
5,"I can say they have the best Fries I had this particular Area. Their Peri peri fries are just amazing didn‚Äôt expect this, must try their momos. They have 2 shops now 1 is on Van and one is near Kharegaon talao."

4,We started Our Dinner With Starter Bombil Fry Which Was Excellent Later the surmai Kari also was very Testy. The chicken Masala rice was Ok Ok... The service was very Fast.. I would like To Recommend to visit..
3,"A nice new place in the neighbourhood. Went there for dinner. The ambience is nothing to write about, jst simple. For starter I ordered chicken tawa, which had fried chicken pieces coated in masala. For main course we ordered chicken masala, mutton masala n tandlachi bhakri. Liked the food. If you stay near by and wanna eat something simple, earthy n good food then you should give this place a try."
4,"I  have visited this place  I have good experience

3,"We had visited here late during late night & opted for AC section.
Ambience was nicely decorated & small place where they have tried to adjust sofas & tables as much as they can.
Prices are very affordable in which you can see premium mughlai recipes are rated reasonably.
FOOD-
MASALA PAPAD [2/5]
It was too much salty topped with chopped tomatoes & onions.
Namkeen was missing.
CHICKEN TANDOORI MASALA KEPSA RICE [3/5]
Before this place whenever I had Kepsa rice we usually get semi gravy at bottom of rice but here scene was different. Dry gravy topped on rice along with salad & boiled eggs. Taste of bite with mixing gravy was good but after 4-5 bites it start feels tasteless.
Chicken pieces cooked in masala very well & goes with it. It was half portion we had order it which is quite sufficient for 3 people.
I wanted to try their Chicken Malai Seekh Biryani but we ordered this as per demand of my friends. You must try it let us know hows it.
Do follow my Instagram page as well for more updates. Thank you !"
1,"Worst place to eat...white coloured hit and sour soup, no taste at all and not worth the money, service is bad at its worst and the waiters have a different level of attitude, I left my soup after having just 2 spoons.Not recommended at all."
1,Quantity of food is very less. They provide half quantity and said it's full.
1,"One of the worst restuarant in Vikhroli.
We ordered chicken pakoda . The tastes was very bad . Unhygienic food.
In main we ordered chicken kolhapuri . But it's also disappointed us. Roti was not properly cooked.
Because of this we didn't go for any further dish.
This restuarant need to change the chef .
Waste of money.
Staff was ok.
Seating arrangements also ok."
1,"Poor quality of food. Order of butter chicken had chicken pieces with bones in it and the waiter said ""Full boneless nai hota"". Epic experience. Also waited 15 mins for the menu and a basic glass of water. Better eat from a better restaurant nearby."
5,"One of the oldest in the area. They sell Vada pav, Daal vada, two types of veg samosas, pakoda (bhajiya)
The items are reasonably priced, taste has been consistent over the years"
5,"Should try Chilli Pakoda, Famously known as Nani Ki Bhajiya"
5,Very old and one the best snacks centre
5,72 years old experience this work
5,Cruncy vada pav. must visit üòã
4,"Nice place with all the meals available and a bidget friendly cost. From Breakfast to lunch to snacks, its a treat to go here. Ample sitting area with aesthetic interiors and indoor games. They have a projector screen for live matches. You can bring in your home lunch and sit here too."
4,"Located on the first floor of Plant 13A, this place is very clean and has a great ambiance. There is a section for food as well as another section for coffee and drinks. The Hazelnut Coffee and Samosa Chaat here is great."
4,"Good facility, reasonable price with variety of food options. During peak lunch hours, waiting period is more."
3,Another in-house cafeteria for godrej one building. Only veg food available. Most of the time the credit card machine is not working and you have to go to remote other counter. Lunch rice plates are usually ample to have. The setting of the corporate restaurant is really great.
5,"Amazing place to be ... Live screen .. table tennis, carrom, restroom, eat fun, explore, work... Anything can be done here.. good Ambience.. organises various exhibitions and sales at many times.. good furniture by Godrej Interio.. staff is good, a bit expensive .. and needs to add variety in food.. as same repetitive food served with time interval..."
4,"McDonald's has been such an amazing place. Avoid visiting on weekends, as it is very crowded and you may have to wait a while for a table. The service was quite slow during our visit, maybe due to the high volume of customers. I would definitely recommend this outlet. This outlet is located on the ground floor of R City Mall. I tried their mc cafe and let me tell you It is so delicious. Nice ambience, nice place.üòä"
5,I‚Äôve been experiencing out of the box service here with the best and happiest employees. Every single person here looks too joy to believe. I‚Äôm lovin it
5,Tried their Korean spicy chicken premium burger - it was exceptionally well made. The chicken patty was juicy and succulent. The sauces were abundant making the experience of eating the burger as fun as it could be.
3,"I've stopped eating burgers and other fast food items from McDonald's due to hygiene concerns, but I still can't resist their Oreo Frapp√© or Chocolate Frapp√©. It's creamy, chocolatey and delicious, just as I like it. It costs Rs. 250, but it's worth it for the taste. They also serve Corn Chaat, which isn't on the menu, but if you ask for it, they'll serve it to you for just Rs. 75."
3,"Avoid visiting on weekends, as it tends to get very crowded and you may have to wait a while for a table. The service was quite slow during our visit, likely due to the high volume of customers."
5,Another cafe in great ambience in rcity . Ambience is cozy and comfy . Good coffee and some nice food to choose from . We had pasta and pizza along with latte. Decent portion and amazing taste.
5,"Cool cafe to visit
With good food & great ambience.
With light music & chilled atmosphere.
So we had :
1)Iced caramel cappuccino.
2)Creamy pesto chicken pasta
This fusion chicken pasta was a great hitüî•
Chunks of chicken pieces added so much taste to the pasta.
3) Chicken supreme pizza
Like the name says
Supreme so does the taste.Give it a try for sure.
4) Vanilla icecream cookie sandwich
Another fusion dessert.
Icecream infused in between cookies
Making the Crunchy n creamy texture.
A great combination.
Do try out once you visit here.

Overall ambience was too cool & we loved visiting this place.
Highly recommended one üíóüíó"
4,"A very small yet ambient space located at a close proximity to ikea. I loved the indie and quaint atmosphere with an invading aroma of fries and good coffee. I ordered a pepper mint tea along with a hazelnut mousse, both were absolute delicacies and my new comfort beverage and dessert. The barista was sweet and amiable. Would love to re-visit."
5,"It's morden it clean it comfortable to siten any away to enjoy time fridaly staff amazin aviation I had a great time spent in this cafe the here commute to gred service and her very friendly

5,"If you are a regular coffee drinker, you must be aware that
Love latte is a popular brand offering plenty of coffee variants that can suit all your moods and taste preferences. This filter coffee by the brand is available in both pouch and tin packaging variants allowing you to buy as per your convenience.When it comes to coffee, you cannot miss out Coffee Day as a go-to cafe or as a premium brand to make amazing coffee at home.  love this filter coffe"
4,"The taste of the pizzas was fantastic. Each slice was with cheesy goodness and had the perfect blend of toppings. I especially loved their signature crust, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Pizza hut ambience is always stunning. Do visit. Good outlet."
1,"Horrible. 45 minutes overall to get 1 fries, 1 garlic bread and 1 cake - 20 minutes at cash counter with Shivani who took average 5-10 minutes per customer! 25 minutes to serve the food by Ayan. Horribly mismanaged and confused team. The worst I had at any Pizza Hut"
4,"I visited Pizza Hut on a Saturday evening, hoping to enjoy some mouthwatering pizzas with my friends. The taste of the pizzas was undeniably fantastic! Each slice was oozing with cheesy goodness and had the perfect blend of toppings. I especially loved their signature crust, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.
However, I have to admit that the store was running quite rush that day. It was bustling with customers, and the staff seemed a little overwhelmed. Despite that, they managed to handle the crowd fairly well, but the wait time was a bit longer than usual. Nevertheless, the friendly staff tried their best to keep up with the orders, and their positive attitude added to the experience.
It was indeed a happier experience, despite the busy atmosphere. The lively chatter of families and friends enjoying their meals created a vibrant ambiance. Moreover, the aroma of freshly baked pizzas made the wait worth it."
1,"I had visited the outlet during lunch time and ordered for meal which included regular corn & cheese pizza, garlic bread and coke. The taste was very blunt and garlic bread was given like just a toasted bread.
Up on that very bad service, the attendant was not at all interested in taking order and no manners to talk with customer. This outlet is not recommended at all there are other outlets in the food court which you can try."
1,"Ordered the meal for two. The pizza was tasty and fresh. The drinks were refreshing. The service was very horrible. The meal was supposed to have 1 pizza, 1 appetizer, 2 drinks and 1 dessert. The appetizer and pizza came at our table. Had to remind them for the drinks. The drinks came after we had finished the pizza and the dessert never came. Very bad experience."
4,"Good donuts available. NO place available to sit and eat the donuts, they couldn't invest in space. So one will have to buy one and eat on the go."
5,"üç© The Brownie Crumble donut is a chocolatey delight, rich and satisfying with every bite üç´.

But the real star is the Blisscoff Bloom‚Äîan absolute must-try! üåü The special edition donut is perfectly crafted, with a delicious blend of flavors that will leave you wanting more.

Highly recommended for anyone with a sweet tooth!"
5,I ordered it online at night but the taste was stale and bad. Giving good reviews because i really liked it from other branches. But it tasted just fine or maybe kept out for too long so the taste differs.
2,"The person on duty in the r city Mall branch seemed very uninterested in servicing us. Firstly it was around 12.15pm and they were still making the display donuts. There were just a handful on display which my kids usually don't eat. I asked the attendant if the one with sprinkles will take time to which very rudely she responded it will take 20 minutes. I ordered other donuts which the kids didn't want. Two minutes later she decorated the sprinkles and gems donuts and put it on display. It was so heartbreaking for the kids and for me as they were also confused how come the ones they wanted magically appeared within minutes.

That too on a happy day of dhanteras when there was festive celebrations everywhere. Usually I love love mod, but this experience was so bad, I just had to highlight this."
5,"We visited here today evening really it's amazing experience, we eats six donuts üç©, all are very delicious,. Specially a Nutella flavour"
4,They will make you wait and food was average. The Sambar and chutney are very watery and taste less. Dosa is vegetable filled and lacks crispiness. The Kesar Falooda is good but they give it early.
3,"Located in the food court of RCity Mall in Ghatkopar West, this place offers a vide variety of veg and Jain options. Tried their Jain pav bhaji and jain bhel. Both in terms of quantity were plentiful. The bhel was a little too tangy - could have been more spicy. Pav bhaji was good."
2,"Chole bhature is average in taste , if you choose a 2 amritsari bature remaining one you have to eat without chole , chole quantity is not sufficient enough for two bathures. Can try with single bature option ."
1,Worst veg thali which I had till date. Not at all price worthy. Taste does not match the price at all. Kindly dont waste money here. Except Gulab Jamun nothing was good.
1,"I have ordered coffee today and totally waste of money üí∞, worst taste no coffee and total water..

Be conscious while buying coffee, hope after this review they will definitely improve the quality."
5,Loved this place

4,Tried the Wednesday bucket. The chicken strips and hot wings were delicious and served piping hot. The leg pieces were too oily and lacked taste. Service was quick and efficient.
5,"We ordered chicken zinger burger and chicken popcorn....... Zinger was f'ing delicious & service was lightning quick.
Staff was well groomed and very helpful throughout my experience......."
1,Pick up service is bad i ordered sausy popcorn we waited more than half an hour they showed us order is ready but while asking they are saying 10mins more order is not ready they are giving the big meals and for one popcorn taking so much time after saying multiple times they gave the order.
1,"chicken was rotten, bone was black. taste was bad. and also the bill i got was half (no survey code part). they are openly doint this fraud, they dont give survey code part to customers. later i asked them for it and gave my feedback."
3,"It's a small outlet in the food court of the mall.
I was a bit disappointed as the fried chicken had a weird crispy layer and the zinger burger's patty wasn't as fresh as I would've liked. It gets crowded on weekends."
5,The place is very wonderful. We had so many options available for jain without compromising taste. Chef prepared delicious pastry for making my birthday more special.

4,"This a great place to eat.

I been here before (when we're in India) and was in on Sunday evening as the Mrs was at her mum & sisters.

Loved the food after having waited almost 15 mins for a table (which was fine) but what spoilt it for me was the adding the ""optional service charge"" to the bill without asking if I was happy to accept ü§î

Perhaps some staff training wouldn't go a miss!"
5,"Great place , continuing the Cream Centre legacy as they should! Sanjay and his team did a great job at serving us! Loved the food and quick service."
3,"Our first order was Ragda Pattice and it was extremely well executed. The flavours textures, temperature for the patty, the ragda, the freshness of the chutney n the fried chilli was really impressive. Unfortunately, from there onwards everything was a steep downhill. We asked for peach ice tea without added ice. It was very syrupy. A solid ""F"".
I love sizzlers, and I absolutely love mushrooms, so I was super happy to see ""Three Mushroom Sizzlers"". It turned out to be a thorough disappointment when they got be a huge portion of overcooked chipchipa noodles with an unsalted sauce. 4 whole tandoori mushrooms, 7-8 tiny pieces of mushroom pakoda and 8 pieces of equally tiny pieces of mushrooms in not more than a spoonful of white sauce. Potato wedges with least amount of effort to get them properly cooked or salted. Tandoori potato which barely touched it's cooking point, again unsalted. It felt like their sizzlers had missed Gandhiji salt satyagraha. It was such a shabby attempt at a Sizzler that it killed all the appetite. I didn't have the courage to order anything else. We had ordered a Sev Puri which was half decent with a serious overload of Sev. I honestly thought ke kisi ke haath se sev ka packet shayad gir gaya hoga. The fact that Cream Centre has not yet discovered Nylon Sev made me a little sad.

Because we were really hungry and didn't want start our lunch at a new restaurant, we ordered a couple of more of the Ragda Pattice and relished this absolutely perfect dish.

My honest advice to Cream Centre, when you say MUSHROOM Sizzler. The hero of the dish MUST be mushrooms. If, for whatever reason, you do not wish to include three different kinds of mushrooms at least give me a sizeable qty of the button mushrooms itself. 35/- ka ek poora packet aata hai and you are charging me 900/- for a Three Mushroom Sizzler. Utna to banta hai. And please, please don't do mushroom pakoda. The besan just overpowers the delicate flavour of mushroom. The white sauce on the other hand was quite nice.

This is an honest feedback of an absolute foodie. The idea is not to degrade or insult you. I am sincerely hoping, the next time I step into a Cream Centre & order a sizzler I will be as impressed as I was today with the Ragda Pattice.

4,Could have been better as mine past experience was good. Display dishes was looking good in quantity and quality but served dishes were lacking same thing
1,"Waste of hared earned money.Display dish items look nice, so tried the pav bhaji . But it was really disappointing. Its priced 250/- INR, but there is absence of taste.
Please dont waste your money."
5,"Good oulet in every mall for veg food..almost in every mall u will find this outlet here u will get Chat like pani puri, Dahi puri ,Kachori etc..

Also u will get chole bathure,Paratha ,Dahi wada etc..staff is good & there service is also good‚Ä¶

U have to wait for 5 to 10 minutes to get your Order..self service is there"
4,"Was not very hungry when ordered the sev puri but ended up ordering one more when finished the first one!
Haven‚Äôt tried much though but loved the quality of food!"
1,Worst food and service. Thy display the food in good plates and serve in cheap paper plate.  Ragda was very very soar and sharp taste. Pathetic. Never try here. I left he food.
1,"Subway Rcity ghatkopar. Pebbles found in corn and peas sub.
Food Quality: The food quality is poor no quality checks are maintain at the store. Local sandwiches are far more better.
Finding a foreign object like a small stone in your food is a serious matter"
5,"More than the food, the service offered at this particular outlet is really commendable. A big  word of appreciation for Siddharth, Pratik, Ayan & Aniket. I come to this particular outlet quite often and as we enter, the staff just reconfirms our order before and they know if before hand!"
1,"Extreme bad behaviour by the cashier and staff. The cleaner man was making the sub with no idea of any patty name and sauce name. The cashier was guiding him while the sub making staff was having a little tea party.

There was no paneer left in their patty boxes and when I told them to refill and make my sub they denied and told it is more than enough to make more than 2 subs.

When I cancelled  the order then too they didn't care.

Very rude staff."
5,"Subways are always my favorite. I see no reason to rate any Subway below 5.

Subways are the best way to fill tummy and stay healthy. Normally in R city mall whenever we visit we eat at Food court. But last time when we had been for movie at Inox and show was about to start subway was best thing to grab and have dinner.

Usually always crowded. Less crowded on week days. It has seating of 6/8 tables. On weekdays one can sit and eat.

I usually prefer all veggie sub. My all time favorite."
5,Really Great Experience I have Visit Last Time And They're Very Friendly And Respectfully Staff And Also Food Quality Best We Love That in staff. Siddharth and pratik the way they're respect there customer and very nice and respectfully behaviour with customer I like that thank you
2,"Well, it is sad to give a 2 star review to this restaurant. Well, I visited Balaji after a very long time. All my previous experiences at this restaurant have been amazing.

But this time found the place pretty average as compared to the prices they have in their menu. The service no doubt is prompt and fast, but the food was average.

We had Paneer Makhanwala, Schezwan noodles and Cheese grilled sandwich which were average in taste. I expected a proper mumbai grilled sandwich with more veggies in it.

Overall, the experience was ok. They can do better and improve the dining experience."
5,"Great, really tasty, very good service and pleasant simple people. Uttapam was nicely done and the Sambar  is fantastic. Will definitely come back again. Well done to all the team there."
4,Good vegetarian food and staff is well trained. Ac was not functioning well it seems due to which it wasn't pleasant sitting there. It might be probably due to the full capacity of the restaurant. We had lunch full of South Indian delicacies ending with filter coffee. Lemon soda wasn't cold as it's supposed to be. Overall food was the main reason for the good rating.
4,"Recently visited Balaji Pure veg hotel in Rcity and the experience was good. I enjoyed having lunch here, the food was great and the quantity was as expected.
We had ordered Veg Crispy for starters, Paneer chatpata which comes with a medium spicy gravy, Dal tadka and with that we tried Butter Kulcha, Butter naan, Butter tandoori roti and Tandoori Roti. All the breads were soft and buttery.

Summary :
Ambience - 4/5
Service - 4/5
Food - 4/5
Cost - 400-500/- each"
3,"Balaji Restaurant is located on the 3rd floor of RCity Mall, Ghatkopar.
On weekend, the whole mall was overcrowded so we end up visiting this restaurant with less waiting.

It is a Pure Vegetarian Restaurant with comfortable seating but the room temperature was hot and humid. I asked the manager then he mentioned that they have given a complaint regarding it.
We ordered Hakka Noodles and Rava Masala Dosa.

Rava Masala Dosa was served cold with coconut chutney and sambhar. The taste was not satisfactory.

Hakka Noodles were palatable. So you can try Noodles here.

They took time in serving but overall service was okay.

They can improve ambience( room temperature), food taste and hospitality skills."
5,"This place is open in the rcity mall

The chicken and veg tikka roll are great. Try their lemon shikanji drink!

Inexpensive!"
4,Great frankies. I always loved there chicken frankies. If you are in Rcity there are many options for you to choose from in the food mall but very few would be reasonable and tasty at the same time. 1 chicken frankie costs 120 bucks. I have given 4 star only because it accepts only cash payment which is off putting in today‚Äôs day and age. Their packaging ensures it‚Äôs not messy
1,THIRD class experience in this tibbs frankie waste of money and waste of time ... And up of that selling some local brand 1 litre bottle at the of 60 rs and it's not even bisleri or some good quality brand water very pathetic kind of arrangements  .. whole food court in ghatkopar R CITY is selling a bottle of water for 20 /- rs and that too bisleri but tibbs frankie it's a very cheap way of selling local things in posh area
1,"Would have given a zero star , this place is so badly managed the manager has absolutely no sense of treating children who go to buy stuff here .

My son loves tibbs frankie (Shivaji park)and I know it doesn‚Äôt take more than 10 mins to get your order but this manager kept my son waiting for 20mins for one chicken tikka frankie .

The cost on their menu card is excluding the GST so be careful.
Best is don‚Äôt go !"
4,Quite a wide range of Frankie's at this joint. Big menu both on veg and non veg side. Fast service.
4,"Sbarro at R City Mall is a solid pick for no-fuss, satisfying pizza. Their slices are generously sized, loaded with toppings, and the crust strikes a nice balance between crispy and chewy. The value for money stands out‚Äîopt for a giant slice or a whole pie, and you‚Äôll leave stuffed without emptying your wallet.

‚úÖ Huge portions ‚Äì Perfect for sharing (or not!).
‚úÖ Quick & convenient ‚Äì Ample seating in the food court makes it easy to refuel during a mall marathon.
‚úÖ Budget-friendly ‚Äì Great for families or groups.

The ambience is standard food court vibes (bright, buzzy, no frills), but that‚Äôs part of the charm. While it‚Äôs a global chain, Sbarro nails the basics here: cheesy, greasy comfort food that hits the spot."
4,"This is one of the best option if you really crave for pizza. Mainly they allows us to choose different styles for each ü•ß piece.

Place was little unclean when I visited. And also their inside AC was not working so fan was not that enough to beat heat of this summer. They just need to work on their interior part to make it 100% perfect.

They were quick to their service and overall options were really good in both veg as well as non-veg.

We tried following:
#Chicken peri peri: Crust was perfect in width and topped with  amazing flavors.

#Chicken supreme: Just wow. I liked this a lot. Even chicken pieces were so well marinated and perfectly Cooked.

#Cheese garlic bread: Regular yet nicely made here and tasted well."
4,"The food was good. Tried Garlic Bread and NY Cheese Pizza 8"". Garlic Bread wasn't as good as the pizza. The Cheese Pizza was what a cheese pizza should be perfectly cheesed and perfectly saucy. Overall Good."
4,"The place is small and nice. Good options when it comes to pizza, varieties of pizza. Love the options. Pizza is also pocket friendly. Service is quite and good. There is not a lot of tables to accommodate, and o wouldn't recommend it for people who want to hang out and relax, as it is next to food court. You will always find people coming in and out. Offers are alot. I recommend this one.
PS: be careful with your first bite. You might burn your tounge as I did...."
2,"So we tried Sbarro at a mall, we ordered chicken pepperoni and tangy paneer with cheesy garlic bread, the whole pizza felt like I am having only the dough. The toppings and the pizza sauce was average with a very thick base, which I didn't like it. So didn't met my expectations. All I can say is it's a one time visit place as there are other pretty outlets for pizza üçï"
5,If you have cravings for tacos this is the place to visit. They serve best tacos. You can also try their rice owls it tastes good
1,"I ordered from zomato and since 50 min the restaurant was showing order preparing and didn't even received call when I wanted to confirm the status. At last they cancelled without any explanation. Do you people value time of others? Nothing was done either from zomato or restaurant for my waste of time, not even a reason was given."
3,First time trying taco bell in India ‚Ä¶ ordered naked chicken taco (good idea to have chicken replacing tortilla) i would like to eat it hot‚Ä¶ and ordered fried chicken strips ‚Ä¶ i loved it so muchüòç .. had churros for first time and m not a fan üòÖ‚Ä¶ need to try other original tacos available.. maybe next time
5,"I'm sad that the outlets at Oberoi Malad mall and Viviana Thane mall no longer exist. But it is here at R-city and they've opened  one at Hiranandani Estate, The Walk. Very similar in flavours to the American original, but with a slight Indian twist on the veggie choices. Impeccable service, a welcome gesture, timing, food quality. Even if you don't like Mexican , you would start liking it after a visit here.
Overall had a great experience would love to visit and recommend other to visit this food joint in future. Thank You Taco Bell"
5,"Taco Bell was good. Had heard a lot about them through American speakers and comedians on YouTube. The place lived up to its expectations. We tried their Nachos and their Tacos. Loved it. The food was nice and quickly delivered. Since this is inside the R-Mall, all other facilities like seating space, clean washrooms, ample parking are taken care of. What remains is the food quality and timely delivery. That's taken care by Taco Bell. Recommended."
4,"Again usually I order online like from Zomato
I ordered few dishes like chicken triple Sean rice and chicken chilly and Sezwan fried rice and it was like awesome was but spicy but trust me it was mouthwatering. And let me tell u they have good quantity for half rice as well full rice . So order accordingly to ur need . I was very happy with the taste like it was but spicy but it‚Äôs ok and the quantity and quality of chicken and rice was great so I wld suggest u all this chinese wok they are amazing. Kudos to there chef and packaging is superb i love the packaging."
1,"At Ghatkopar R City Mall, food court, I had ordered veg- manchow soup, chicken triple Schezwan rice with chicken gravy... Honestly, in the name of soup it's just Knorr manchow soup which includes some veggies inside the packet and the rice was quite salty with lot of ajino moto... I had told to avoid ajino moto as it's not good for health... And the spoon for soup is of no use as the spoon is flat, how can one drink soup... I didn't like it... For me, it's a scam... People please choose your food accordingly and stay alert"
5,The best Veg Chilli Garlic noodles I have had in recent times. So far I have had Chinese Wok food from different outlets and the taste have been always great.
1,"Pathetic service. Very rude staff.
How can customer eat soup with this type of spoon. No scoop. Zero value for money."
1,"Chinese wok one of the good Chinese place but on Sunday when there was rush in the mall, they served the food quality very low. They make me waited for more than 30 min and still not served full combo I paid for at one time. Manchurian gravy was like manchow soup and momos were uncooked.
A lot of disappointment!"
1,"Today, I visited Rajdhani, and the food was absolutely disappointing. None of the dishes tasted good; in fact, it was so bad that we could hardly eat anything. What made it worse was the staff‚Äôs behavior‚Äîthey were serving food forcefully, even when we clearly refused. After just a few bites, I started feeling uneasy, and unfortunately, my family members are also experiencing discomfort. The entire day felt wasted due to this terrible experience. I strongly advise considering this review before spending your hard-earned money here."
5,"Visited Rajdhani on Priya day. Staff was very welcoming and kind , the food includes almost all special dishes of Rajasthan.. Amazing and very hygienic food. Good hospitality,  must visit."
5,Enjoyed the meal the food was tasty and unlimited... A best place to enjoy your dinner or lunch with your family and friends
1,"The Aamras they served was not even close to what Aamras tastes. It tasted like artificial colouring added to mangoes with water. The quality of food is also deteriorating by the day, the service isn‚Äôt great either other than pushing the customers to eat more! Everything is oily, too sweet and unreal. Highly disappointing!"
5,"A pure Rajasthani and Marwadi culture food full of love and taste. It is a well known chain of restaurants who serves pure vegetarian Indian cousins. I visited here on Saturday. They have different menu combinations on different day and care for their customers as anything.
Quality food, ambient lighting, attractive entrance, welcoming approach, comfortable sittings and serving concern makes this place something unique and gives you an attachment feel. Just one suggestion, try to take a control on over serving otherwise it could lead in trouble in finishing, because they have variety of menu items.
All together in my opinion, its a occasional visit place and best for family time."
3,"liked it as a regular coffee, but I didn't find it special as expected."
5,Happy meal with milk shake and fries
4,"All good, but is just a little bit loud the background music. Perfect spot before or after a movie (BmX cineplex around the corner)"
2,Cinnamon flavour...just ignore it. Don't know which Cinnamon they invented!!!
3,The Chocolate chip muffin and Hot Fudge with Walnut brownie are a good pick!
5,"Really love the food that is served here . The gravy is in the dishes is really yummy . They have a huge variety of wraps and rice with Chole which is really delicious and tasty . Had ordered the food and was really happy with the service and the delivery it‚Äôs was fresh and still hot and the food is yummy . Had tried the in the wraps and rice .
The cheesy corn salsa wrap maida paratha - this wrap is served with corn , onions , salsa sauce , with lots of melted cheese it‚Äôs really tasty and tangy . It‚Äôs really saucy the melted cheese in the wrap is just the best.
Masala panner tikka wrap maida paratha - the masala panner tikka wrap is really nice the Panner piece in the dish is really tasty and they are really soft and juicy . The it‚Äôs stuffing is really tasty and it‚Äôs also filled with lots of melted cheese .
Then had tried the jumbo veg rice feast chole jumbo - the rice is really delicious as it‚Äôs served with chole and the Chole is really yummy and tasty . The chole gravy really goes well with the rice and it enhances the taste of the rice .
Really one should really visit this place as the food that is served here is really tasty and great and the presentation is really well and it‚Äôs worth visiting and trying . I am going to surely visit this place and one Should also and the service is also really nice .
Over all 10/10 ."
3,"Faasos has come up with this new Navratri Special Meal for those who fasts in these nine days, so they dont have to worry about their meal anymore!

They have added some really good options in this menu. I tried the ALOO PARATHA WITH PANEER MAKHANWALA. It came with two Sabudana Vada, couple of Aloo Parathas with Paneer Makhanwala, Allo Sabji, Sabudana Kheer and Curd. The food was really good, I liked the sabudana vadas and kheer and the Paneer makhanwala was delicious too! The packing was good, all the items were intact when delivered.

Only thing is the service i.e. the delivery time has to be improved."
5,"And when you are out and come home no mood to make dinner just order right.... And here I ordered Faasos....

Super fast delivery...

Yum taste...

Corn cheesy wrap... It was delicious

Cheesy Paneer wrap... It was Yummlicious with super stuffing...

And jumbo fest veg rice with chole gravy... Yum rice...

All the food was with great taste and quantity was fine. .. They give you seasoning also along with this and that also gives extra taste to your food."
4,"This place makes awesome wraps and decent tasting Indian food. The delivery is also prompt except during peak hours. Also, this place delivers till 1am which is a great option for those late night food cravings. Loved the cheesy aloo wrap, mexican salsa wrap and paneer tikka rice. However, sometimes the staff isn't courteous while talking over the call while they call to confirm the address or the order."
5,"Heard alot about this place from friend.. So we decided to order this at our office during our lunch time..
.

We decided to order for
Masala Paneer Tikka Wrap : It was a perfect in taste not to spicy.. Taste was amazing..

Service was amazing..
Delivery was on time.."
3,"We visited the Hiranandani Powai Business Park outlet. The food was neither exceptionally good nor particularly bad ‚Äî average at best. It‚Äôs a decent option if you‚Äôre nearby, but not worth a special trip.

The outlet has open seating with a few tables and chairs, making it inconvenient during the rainy season. Also, despite being listed on the menu, none of the iced teas were available ‚Äî a basic offering that was missing.

Food Ordered:
1.	Korean Spicy Maggi ‚Äì We were expecting something unique, but it turned out to be very basic, similar to what one can easily prepare at home.
2.	Peri Peri and Cheese Fries ‚Äì The Peri Peri fries were decent. However, the cheese fries were quite disappointing ‚Äî the cheese sauce tasted like generic white pasta sauce, lacking flavour.
3.	Aglio Olio Blooming Bread ‚Äì Tasted good but was overly spicy.
4.	Cold Coffee ‚Äì This was the only item that stood out and tasted genuinely good.

Service Experience:
The service was subpar. There is no table service ‚Äî customers must collect their food from the counter. While this in itself isn‚Äôt a problem, the execution was poor. The staff member at the counter called out each order only once, without any effort to identify the customer or ensure the food reached the right person. If you aren‚Äôt paying close attention, your food might sit at the counter and go cold before you even realize it‚Äôs ready.

Overall, this outlet is fine for a quick bite if you‚Äôre already nearby, but it doesn‚Äôt offer enough in terms of food or service to warrant a special visit."
5,"My experience at Hungry Head Restaurant in Powai was nothing short of fantastic. The outer sitting space was inviting, the service was impeccable, and the food was absolutely delicious. I particularly enjoyed the innovative Maggi creations, such as the Exotic Cheese Magizza and the Shaslik Maggie Sizzler, which were bursting with flavor and creativity. The Berry Smoothie and Peach Mojito were the perfect refreshments to accompany the meal.

Furthermore, the staff were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu, making helpful recommendations and accommodating any special requests. The Sizzling Brownie dessert was the perfect indulgence to end the evening.

Overall, I highly recommend Hungry Head Restaurant to anyone looking for delicious food, great service, and a cozy ambiance. It's a dining destination that consistently exceeds expectations and leaves you craving for more."
5,"Innovative concept and delicious food. Ambiance is good.

Kids love the Maggi products. And the drinks too are amazing.

Service is fast and believe me you would go back with fully filled stomach.

They also help you select from the menu options based on your likings. Recommend food that you might like accordingly to your past choices.

Even the tables have a unique touch.

When you are hungry, head to hungry head at Powai. You have lot of activities for the entire family near by. Lot of games and swings for children. Lots of other shops nearby if you still have space left in the stomach.

A good place to hand out with entire family."
4,"A destination for Maggi lovers. Almost all the options in their menu has something to do with Maggi in it and they all seem worth trying.
It has an outside seating area that can be a bit uncomfortable. This is a self service place as well, but the food is ready to be eaten pretty quickly.
Apart from the usual variations of Maggi, Blooming Bread is recommended for something different.
We also tried Mayhem Fries, which is probably one of the very few dishes at this joint that doesn't have Maggi. It was loaded with cheese and tasted great as well. Took us a while to finish it though..üòã"
2,"Tried their Moburg, costed me 126 but must say I missed Wow momos Moburg of some 50+ on which they used to have 1 on 1. Lol. I felt these guys are overhyped. It's an okayish burger, nothing special about it. Atleast I thought that since their whole brand is about maggi they will put Maggi in burger but naah same old tikki. Presentation is good, they serve it with wafers. But presentation ka kya karega insaan. Also, the place is full, hard to find a chair to sit. And, since burger isn't that big or something, you definitely need 2 or more burgers to have it as lunch/dinner. For brunch 1 may be okay."
3,"Went for a late lunch so had access to south indian snacks from their menu

Ordered the following
Medu vada 3/5
Masala dosa 3/5
Onion tomato uthappa 3/5

All dishes were decent but nothing spectacular for the pricing.

Seating is well spaced and comfortable.
Service was relatively fast.
Ambience was that if a lunch/dining hall.
Overall the experience was average keeping the price in mind."
5,"Best , rates are moderate, staff are Good , food extra ordinary,

Misal pav , best test
Batata Vada ....

With two types of chutney

Deep fried fresh Green chiili

Enjoyed

All other items extra ordinary

Parking space available

Positive environment"
1,Food quality is good but the service is very very pathetic... Too slow took one hour just for a masala dosa!! Not recommended!!
5,Excellent food for vegetarians. South Indian varieties are quite good. Ambience is traditional.
4,Nice hotel we went there a family get-together we were 10 members  there is ac room and good and fast service and nice space good environment. Good food also. Good family restaurant. I like veg Manchurian soup. And dal fry also good. Other disesh also fine. 10 people and from starter to meal and dessert our bill was around 4000 RS. So price wise good restaurant.
1,"Disappointing Experience with Monginis Food

I'm still trying to process the awful experience I had with Monginis. I ordered a Chicken Burger and Chicken Pizza, excited for a quick and delicious meal. But what I got was a food safety nightmare.

The staff reheated my food in a microwave oven that was clearly on its last legs. When I complained about the uneven heating, I was shocked that they insisted the oven was working fine. It was like they weren't taking my concerns seriously.

The next day, I paid the price for their negligence. I spent the entire day in bed, battling severe diarrhea and vomiting. It was a miserable experience that left me feeling drained and frustrated.

As someone who's always been a fan of Monginis, this experience was a huge letdown. I expect more from a reputable brand, especially when it comes to food safety and customer well-being."
4,I ordered the rainbow fruit pastry and the red velvet pastry. 5 stars for the red velvet pastry for its taste and freshness. The rainbow cake was not too fresh and I may not buy it again. The shop is a little space located at a prime location. They have good variety of savoury snacks and slice cakes too.
4,Monginis is the brand which got cakes into our lives since so long. Now with so much competition still they are managing well with lots of variety and that too at reasonable rates. My recent favorite is Hazelnut cake and Strawberry cream cake. The best of this franchise branch of Monginis is it's location. Close of railway station and bus stop makes it easily accessible.
3,"I had ordered a Dutch chocolate cake, the cake was just amazing but, the chocolate sponge could've been much better i mean it was a little hard. The frosting was too goodüòã also the overall cake was lovely!"
1,We bought anonginis cake from here few days before. Say 19th.black forest was the cake. The cake had perfect appatence. But when we are at home it had a stable taste. We were shocked. Monginis cake so bad. Never expected the dame
3,Place is nice atmosphere is also good but I doesn't like the taste of the food quantity is also less price is very high
5,The food was good and the service was adequate. We were group of 25 people and the only issue was two tables were being missed. Atmosphere of the hotel is good and it is clean place to dine in.
2,"Amantran Restaurant is not as good as it was previously. The food tasted very average. Nothing great about visiting here.  Food ingredients & quality wise also okay. Prices they are charging are very high if we see the food quality.
Ambience is good & cozy, huge seating space as well along with parking facility."
3,"Restaurant was good at dining, seating environment etc. Service was really good. Parking area is there's own. So no need to park on road. But what we ordered I didn't liked much. It was ok ok type taste. If they have to increase more customers they have to give in the taste best."
3,"So we visited this restaurant yesterday and the food was justt Amazing. We had ordered...
Chicken Manchurian Soup - One of the best soups I have ever tasted. The quantity was also good. 5/5
Chicken lollypop - The taste was superb but a little oily but worth it. 4/5
Veg. schezuan bakka noodles - One of the best I have had. The noodles were properly cooked with perfect amount of spices and sauces and veggies as well. 5/5
...
The ambience was good. There was Live screening of cricket on and music as well. The service was also good.
...
The only 1 issue was the plates weren't as clean as they should be.
Other than that amazing experience."
4,"Hey there, fellow food enthusiasts!

I recently had the pleasure of visiting Love & Latte in Mulund, and let me tell you, the cozy atmosphere of this place is an instant mood-lifter. As soon as you step inside, you're enveloped in a vibe that feels like a warm hug.

Now, I'll be honest ‚Äì the service was a tad slow, but trust me, the wait was absolutely worth it. The Camel Frappe and the Hot Chocolate were the shining stars of the menu. An extraordinary blend of flavors, Oh, and let's not forget about the Cottage Cheese Puff! This delectable treat was truly the cherry on top of my visit.

Do give it a whirl and treat yourself to a gastronomic delight that'll leave you craving for more.

Until next time, happy indulging!"
3,"A Cozy Cafe with a Heart!

I stopped by Love N Latte early in the morning, and I was pleased to find it open at 8:30 am. The staff were courteous and welcoming, setting a positive tone for my visit.

The cafe was clean and well-maintained, which is always a plus.

For food, I opted for the English Breakfast, which consisted of saut√©ed mushrooms, chicken sausage, 2 eggs, 2 bread toasts, and baked beans. While the dish was moderately filling, I felt the quantity could have been better, especially considering the price of INR 300. Other cafes often include hash browns, salads, or fruits, which were missing here.

The Smoothie Bowl was a highlight, and I appreciated the option to choose almond milk. It tasted really good, and I'm glad they offer vegan options.

The coffee was average, but the real star of the show was the cafe's compassion and inclusivity. A stray dog wandered in, and the staff allowed me to bring it inside. The dog sat quietly in the corner, and it was heartwarming to see the cafe's kindness. ( He is a regular there)

Those seeking a cozy atmosphere, and anyone looking for vegan options. Bowl was a highlight, and I appreciated the option to choose almond milk. It tasted really good, and I'm glad they offer vegan options.

While the food and drinks may not have been exceptional, the cafe's warm atmosphere and commitment to inclusivity and compassion towards the voiceless shows the intention of the people running the cafe."
5,"A great place for chilling with friends and perfect for office work.

Excellent choice of Coffees and Snacks."
3,"The best part about this cafe is its ambience. Calm, cosy and quite relaxing. The staff is discrete and quick in service and it's the best place to sit and catch up on your work or you hangout with your friends after a long day at work.

Coffee - 3/5
Ambience - 5/5

4,"Visited this place for a good breakfast with my friends. This place is quite spacious and they have outdoor seating too. The decor is pretty good with all the coffee related art on the walls.

The ambience is relaxing and peaceful. Perfect place to chill, relax and sip good coffee.

‚Ä¢Bronze Frost Cold Coffee
‚Ä¢Red Chilli Chicken Sandwich
‚Ä¢Chicken Supreme Pizza

4,"Kirti Mahal, a pure veg restaurant in Mulund West is one of the preferred places to dine in. Following a recent renovation, the ambiance is now more inviting, with outdoor, AC and non-AC sections, as well as flexible seating arrangements for groups of all sizes. The diverse menu showcases a range of delectable North Indian, South Indian, and Chinese dishes. While the food is delicious, some waiters can be a bit assertive. Nevertheless, this restaurant remains a top choice in the area."

5,"Kirti Mahal at Paachrasta, Mulund, is a delightful pure veg restaurant that offers an exceptional dining experience. The restaurant's ambiance is cozy, with separate sections for both AC and non-AC dining. The AC section boasts comfortable lounge seating that ensures a pleasant meal.

The staff is a real asset, providing valuable insights to help customers select the best dishes from the extensive menu. We started with the iconic Wada Sambar, a Kirti Mahal specialty. The sambar is authentic and bursting with flavor, invoking childhood memories of craving this classic dish.

One of the highlights of our visit was the Cheese Pav Bhaji, a true taste extravaganza. It's generously loaded with cheese, creating a mouthwatering delight. Don't forget to order extra pav if you're not a fan of waiting, as this dish is immensely popular.

We also tried the Alu Mutter with Butter Roti, and it didn't disappoint. The gravy was expertly prepared, catering to our taste buds perfectly. Overall, our experience at Kirti Mahal was nothing short of awesome. I would give hygiene 4 as there was water dripping from the roof or else would have rated hygiene 5‚≠êÔ∏è. If you're in Mulund and seeking a fantastic veg dining experience, a visit to Kirti Mahal is a must. It promises to be a magnificent culinary journey you won't forget.

3,"The food was average, also we called for Chi Maharaja and butter roti for main course on their recommendation but the taste was quite bland, but the kitchen staff was kind enough to replace it."
1,"I ordered yesterday for my guests‚Äî5 butter tandoori rotis and a normal spicy chicken handi. The order arrived on time, but the chicken was undercooked and not properly cooked at all! ü§¢ The butter tandoori rotis were also not good; they gave me something that looked like wheat rotis instead. üò†

The food quality was very bad, and on top of that, their customer service was even worse. I immediately called Caf Maz (Bhandup Sonapur) to complain. They asked me to WhatsApp the pictures, which I did. üì∏ But after that, they only replied about the tandoori roti and completely ignored my other messages. No proper response, no call back‚Äîjust terrible service! üö´üìû

‚ö†Ô∏è Bad experience with food quality and even worse customer support. They don‚Äôt care about customer complaints. Think twice before ordering from here! ‚ùåüëéüò§"
1,"Worst food. The ratings are paid ratings. Chicken is always undercooked, have tried 2-3 times, but NEVER AGAIN now. Taste is pathetic, just overuse of chilly and oil. Not at all worth it even if they are giving food for free. So many know people had got severe diarrhoea after eating the food."

A common man‚Äôs go to place.
Would highly recommend to have the biryani here.

Loved it.
One suggestion the lights could be brighter at this place.

Additionally, the seating arrangements varied and were appropriate."
4,"The Great Shalimar is a hidden restaurant in the hustle-bustle of MG Link Road. They have this special seating arrangement section called Dastaarkhwan, where you can enjoy a hearty meal with your family & friends.
We had ordered: Chicken Manchow Soup, Chicken Crispy, Chicken Banjara Kebab,
Veg Kolhapuri, Butter Roti, Chicken Triple Schezwan Rice, Dal Khichdi & Masala Papad.
What I liked the most was the Manchow soup & Chicken crispy. The rest was also good. The management is very courteous and the food was also served on time. Good quality and budget friendly restaurant. The Dastaarkhwan easily seats 8-9 people and it has a door so gives you complete privacy for your get together or party."
5,"The food, the variety was absolutely amazing since the new management has joined recently and ofcourse Dastarkhan was the Highlight of this restaurant!
Few of my favorite dishes were Chicken lollipop üçó  Chicken tikka masala ü•ò Chicken biryani üçö
It‚Äôs the best place to hangout with a group of friends as the food is delicious and pocket friendly too!"
4,"The hotel has an amazing ambience and the food is just next level in taste.
Capacity is somewhat less compared to other competitive hotels nearby, but overall it's a great experience to have food there.
I tried chicken afghani, mutton kolhapuri and chicken tandoori, everything was amazing in taste.
The staff is too good and serves you on time.
Both A/C and Non A/C sittings are available."
1,Worst food ever tasted in my life chicken lollipop is worst and not fresh even Schwan's rice without salt  order no 6412. Going to file complaint food safety department
5,"Visited this place few days back and had a really great  time they have recently renovated this place and gave a new look and its under new management now so they have also changed many other things.

CHICKEN LOLIPOP
VEG MANCHURIAN DRY
CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA

Quality and quantity is very good and plus its very cheap. We had a really great experience here definitely visiting again. Totally recommended üëç"
1,"This sunny ka dabha is providing stale food, i ordered veg triple noodles recieved very badly rotten stale noodles. Restaurant owner  do you serve same to your child? Guys please avoid this restaurant else you will end up with serious health issues. I wish i could take legal action and cancel idiots license."
1,"I've visited this hotel multiple times, hoping the food quality would improve, but it's always been pathetic and overpriced. The food is stale every time."
1,"Lollypop is too much worst and chutney not inside in this order, faltu dhaba, close this dhaba"
1,"Pathetic service. Seating arrangements are not comfortable. Almost after 40 mins person came to take our order. We had to serve ourselves as waiters were so confused where to serve what. Manager and waiters doesn't have any manners how to treat thier
guests/ customers. Food was good but over pricey. It is Dhaba for a name sake."
1,"I ordered chiken thali, tandoori chicken & Roomali roti.
Chiken thali had a half filled gravy box and plain rice( Thali is something which has all basic items in indian meal like chapati / bhakri/ roti  , one or two gravys, salad, pickles, papad and rice). Tandoori chicken was not cooked properly. Roomali roti was good.
I have been to this restaurant to dine is as well and my experience at that time was superb.

Online order from uber eats was a disaster."
3,"This is a very busy and popular bar in Nahur area. Food is decent, provided one sticks to regular stuff and doesn't get too adventurous. Like the Surmai Tawa Fry we ordered was a waste of money and the Veg Manchurian Dry was decent. Service is inconsistent - sometimes quick, slow sometimes. It's like countless other bars, easy to forget if something slightly better comes around."
4,"This is an afordable/budgted bar, good quality is good specially non veg dishes. Service is fast and ambience is okay. They have two screens and plays live matches. Good for people wants to Njoy live sports while drinking. They have car parking."
5,"Amazing non vegetarian food. Went there based on a strong recommendation by a friend. And it didn't disappoint.
Ordered Prawns Goan curry and Rawas tawa fry
Prawns Goan curry: 4/5
Rawas tawa fry: 4.5/5 (great quality)

Service was too good, very prompt."
4,"They are located near the highway. They have ground + 1st floor seating arrangements. During weekends it's obviously crowded and its better to reserve prior to visiting. The seating in the 1st floor is really awesome compare to the ground one. Food is indeed delicious be it any cuisine. The staff are really polite and helpful. The owner is very good, he will ensure everything is managed properly. Mr. Alam was the manager and indeed he was catering to our requirement. They do serve alcohol as well.

Must visit this hotel once."
3,"We visited Family section.
Ambience is bit old and sad.
Food is moderate, we ordered Prawns Koliwada, Chicken Clear Soup, Chicken Tikka & Sweet Lime Soda.

Clear Soup was like boiled chicken in water, very sad and tasteless.

Out of all these Prawns Koliwada was good.

Service is good.
Need to improve the ambience."
5,"We rented the hall for my husband's 50th birthday and it was perfect!
Great space, helpful staff, and awsome food, everything went smoothly. Even my guest loved this hall .
Highly recommend for any celebration!"
5,"Shera 2.0 is a vibrant North Indian restaurant that offers an exceptional dining experience with three unique dining areas. The live ghazals and music on weekends add a soulful touch to the ambiance. The food is outstanding‚Äîdon‚Äôt miss their flavorful Chicken Karachi Dry and rich Kofta Curry. A perfect spot for great food, lively vibes, and memorable evenings. Highly recommended!"
5,"Recently visited Shera 2.0, and it turned out to be a great experience. The ambiance is warm and inviting, with options for rooftop, open seating, and a cozy indoor restaurant.

The menu offers a wide variety of Indian and Oriental dishes. The staff was attentive and helpful throughout our visit.

We tried the blue lagoon and green lagoon mocktails, which were refreshing. For starters, the paneer corn cheese sheekh kebab and crispy corn chilli pepper were packed with flavor. In the main course, the subzi handi paired with garlic naan and butter roti was delicious, and the dal khichdi added a comforting touch. We ended the meal on a sweet note with some ice cream.

Shera 2.0 is a place I‚Äôd recommend for its delicious food, relaxing ambiance, and excellent service."
5,"We tried all the Chef‚Äôs specialties and newly introduced dishes.
I loved the Chicken Kofta curry which has those tender minced chicken balls.
Chicken Basil Chilly Gravy with Burnt Garlic rice ( Veg ) is a match made in heaven.
Chicken Pasanda kebab was juicy and tender
Orange margarita was perfect.
At Shera 2.0 they have lifted the game for vegetarians with their signature Dum ka Paneer ( starter ) tandoor dish which is later mildly cooked it dum.
The subzi handi is scrumptious for those who want a change from their Paneer tikka masala.
To end we finished off with butterscotch ice cream.

Service was really nice . The portion size was apt and the seating area is quite spacious. They have a great rooftop,AC seating and ghazal nights on Tuesday, Thursday and weekends."
4,"Visited Gopalas after almost decade! Here‚Äôs what my experience was.

- The service is top-notch! A well trained staff and courteous. From the time you enter, you are greeted & treated well.
- Food is great, all the food we ordered was freshly made

Suggestions:
- It is always a challenge for waiter in any restaurant to explain vegetarian dishes. Hence, to avoid any confusion for the visitors the restaurant should briefly mention about the dishes in the menu.
- The paintings/posters of Krsna were a dirty, when seen from an angle. Please maintain them well."
1,"THINK BEFORE YOU GO ....They serve small bowl of food like shabudana khichadi at 197Rs, taste worse than 40rs road side khichadi isn't it looting custumers....
When five-star hotels dies that people critise but such hotels when charge premium for smallest portion of food is really not acceptable.

My genuine concern is for customer it's fine I made a mistake by going here but review is for think before you go here"
1,"We had a very disappointing experience. The table and seating were dirty, and the water glass was unhygienic ‚Äî it had to be replaced twice. The waiter was visibly irritated when we pointed this out. Our appetiser was served late, and the main course kept getting delayed despite repeated follow-ups. After waiting 30 minutes, we asked if the order was ready; instead of helping, the staff rudely told us to cancel and leave. The service was extremely poor and lacked basic hospitality. This place was once known for its polite staff and spiritual vibe, but sadly, it's no longer up to the mark."
5,"The dining experience here was truly exceptional. From the moment we stepped in, we were enveloped in an aura of tranquility and spirituality. The ambiance, though understated, was incredibly calming, making the entire dining experience a truly memorable one.

The food itself was a masterpiece. Every dish was a symphony of flavors, a delicate balance of spices and textures that tantalized the taste buds. The chef clearly possesses an artistic flair, transforming simple ingredients into culinary delights. While the prices might seem a tad steep initially, the quality and the unique ambiance undeniably justify the cost.

Beyond the delectable food, it was evident that the establishment infused a sense of spirituality into every aspect of the dining experience. This subtle yet profound touch added an extra layer of depth, making the meal more than just a culinary indulgence. It was a journey for the senses, a harmonious blend of taste, sight, and spirit.

I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking a unique and unforgettable dining experience. Be prepared to indulge in a culinary masterpiece while immersing yourself in a serene and spiritually uplifting atmosphere."
1,"I‚Äôve been a regular at Gopala's Next for a long time because of their consistent taste and reliable service. However, my recent experiences have been very disappointing. The quality of food especially north Indian has noticeably declined, and the service has become sluggish and disorganized. It‚Äôs disheartening to see a place that once maintained such high standards now falling short.May give it one more shot, hope they can get back to the level of quality they were once known for."
5,"One of the great places to spend time with your family and friends. The drinks rates are also reasonable. Must try burnt garlic chicken in the starter. You can also have chicken dum biryani, not many options available in biriyani but the taste is good. The quantity of all the dishes is pretty good.
And the staff is also very supportive and provides nice service."
1,Manager vivek said that it is mandatory to pay service charges to pay the bill from swiggy dineout. Service charges were almost equal to discount from swiggy. Very rude manager. Chicken in the soup/shorba was over cooked. I literally left the chicken as it is. Dal tadka and rice was the only good food that I had.
5,"‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Highly Recommended!

Food Studio has been my go-to place for an amazing dining experience, and every visit has been nothing short of fantastic! The food is always delicious, with a wide variety of options for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. The flavors, presentation, and quality are consistently top-notch.

I have cherished every meal here and enjoyed wonderful dinner evenings with my loved ones. The service is excellent, and the ambiance adds to the overall experience. Keep up the great work in maintaining such high standards."
4,"I‚Äôve been dining and ordering from this place for a long time, and it‚Äôs one of the gems in the Mulund area. I‚Äôve tried many of their items, and they‚Äôre consistently great. The Nawabi Murg, chicken stuffed with cheese, is absolutely melt-in-the-mouth delicious.

The only downside was their chicken lollipop, which was undercooked‚Äîhopefully just a one-off. But everything else has been fantastic! Their Chicken Tangdi Kebab is a personal favorite‚Äîtwo large, perfectly cooked pieces that are just the best.

Their chicken biryani is amazing, but the mutton biryani takes it to the next level. And don‚Äôt even get me started on their Kheema Pizza‚Äîit‚Äôs to die for, simply mouth-watering.

I love this place for its great ambiance, although the service can be a little slow due to the crowds. That‚Äôs why I usually opt for food delivery, but it‚Äôs still an awesome place to visit or order from. Definitely a must-try!"
5,"We had a gala time with a group of 11 of us. Service was great and they kept sending Virgin mohitos coming. Starters were excellent. Chicken salad was am issue, but I guess happens once in a while. Treated well, ambience was nice."
5,Very popular vegetarian place in Mulund..Lively place with huge menu options to choose from. We have been to this place for quite a few times and experience has always been amazing. Food tastes good . Tried multiple cuisine available from Indian to Chinese Thai and it had been overall a good experience.
2,"The food is very average. Music is too loud with fast beats, trying to make you dance, but there is no space to dance! So loud that you can neither talk amongst yourselves nor you can converse with the staff to place orders. Overpriced considering the experience.
Surgical strike starter was average, nothing special.
Pot rice was decent. Spicy Guava mocktail was good.
Greek goodness pizza üçï was good, but can be better.
Nachos were very soggy, kindly Avoid!"
5,"""Tiger Tiger Lounge is a fantastic pure veg restaurant with a great ambiance and delicious food. The flavors are rich, the presentation is excellent, and the service is warm and friendly. A perfect spot for vegetarians looking for a delightful dining experience!"""
5,"If you‚Äôre in Mulund and craving some irresistible vegetarian delicacies, Tiger Tiger Lounge is the place to be! This restaurant serves an impressive variety of dishes that are not only flavorful but also presented beautifully.

I had the pleasure of trying a few of their specialties. The Basil Garlic Noodles had a wonderful garlicky kick, making every bite super enjoyable. The Cheese Cigar Roll was a crispy delight with its creamy, cheesy core. The Hara Bhara Tikki was soft, packed with fresh greens, and tasted amazing with their chutneys. The Paneer Kurkure stood out with its crunchy texture and spicy, tangy flavors. The Tiranga Paneer, with its three different marinades, was both a visual and a culinary treat.

With a great ambiance, top-notch service, and scrumptious food, Tiger Tiger Lounge is a must-visit for all food lovers!"

1,It's too loud as mostly local people visit here and make too much noise and sometimes even quarrels turn into fights. The service is very poor and the menu is costly going by the service provided.
3,Order in this restaurant they will bring from other restaurants and they don't have most food on the menu......if you are looking for a cheap bar without good food it's better for you...they give you completely chana and etc
1,"One of the worst bar and restaurant, staff don‚Äôt have proper way to talk with their customer they are so rude.

I suggest all of you not to go in that restaurant.

I wanted to enjoy the day with my friend but they spoiled it and I don‚Äôt wanted to spoil my entire day so I left the restaurant without having any thing."
1,"Pathetic Experience....
Do not buy any alcohol from here, coz they will sale expire alcohol and also refuse to take again, and the staff is also aarogent, they don't have manners to how to talk with the customers, the owner is also ignoring the customer concerns.
Be aware, please check date 100 times before buying the alcohol in lockdown or any time.
Or check the other near by options to buy alcohol. üôè"

Stay away from this brand as it‚Äôs not made with real milk
It‚Äôs just made with palm oil
Kindly read the ingredients before consuming from kwality walls brand !!

Beware from Palm oil frozen dessert"
4,"This place serves end number of options for ice creams, not only kwality but also other brands are available here. I tried dinshwa's choco chip and butterscotch cornetto, it was quite creamy and not too sweet which was the best part about it.
I loved it!üòã"

5,Get all type of Icecream and owner is very good person
5,Best place to get ice-cream close by for me
1,"Food was very very blant. Chef may be on ""BP free Bharat"". Very tasteless food. No salt no spice at any dises. Chicken crispy came with bone which is very hard one.
We ordered normal water he gave only first round after that not listing so we ordered bislery. Bislery always on time. 1 rating also not deserved."
3,"A/C flow was very bad, i changed my seat two times even when no one was their in restaurant but still didn't got flow so had to manage without that. Taste was normal not great. Tried chinese cuisine but it was more like Indian spices mixed so did not liked much. I tried Chinese dish ""Paneer chatpata"" & Masala papad. I forgot to click it's picture. Also in masala papad it was more salty. Rate was little bit costly not much."

4,"A good store to get a variety of items both veg & non veg. I visit here regularly and find items both branded and local which i generally don't find at other places. Owners are very warm and welcoming as well. Also, provide items from Pune which is great!"
1,I ordered TNT Rice the gravy was very unpleasant a kind of bitter in taste. Also the chicken was not tasting fresh. It was a complete waste of money and a bad experience. The ambience was good but food was not. The taste of the food doesn't met the standard.
1,"I ordered Veg Handi and what I got was really some vegetable tossed in oil with tomato purey masalas were not cooked properly and this Veg Handi costed me 303RS which was not worth at all.
Won't recommend ordering the same."
4,We ordered their Chinese sapo rice and chicken appetizer and the taste was simply amazing. Just what you need after a long day
4,"All in all a very amazing experience whenever you visit this place, full of cozyness and PUNJABI VIBES...Tandoor items are crazy. Very very good food. I have stopped visiting other eatery in mulund. Taste is even better then some good restaurants in mulund. I am talking about Punjabi cuisine..

Highly recommended.."
5,Try this restaurant for chinese cuisines...also kebabs are awesome and chicken triple rice is awesome....I have had food from various chinese joints in Mulund but this is the best....don't forget to try there flavoured goti soda during your meal...
5,"I have ordered from this restaurant after seeing all the positive reviews
I ordered chicken fried rice and veg noodles.
Both tasted good.
My best pick here is chicken fried rice you will never regret it. For every spoon ful of rice you may get atleast one chicken piece.
Prices are little high but I don't know whether these are true restaurant prices or not because I ordered from Zomato"
5,"A very decent restaurant that serves a delightful mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian cuisine in a warm and welcoming environment. The ambiance is inviting, with tasteful decor that blends modern elegance with cozy seating, perfect for family outings or casual dining with friends"
1,They have reduced the size of wadas given in wada pav. Not worth the money. Better eat wada pav from somewhere else.
4,Excellent interiors with the capacity of 200-250 people
3,It's located in Mulund West. The locality is descent and you may see more Gujarati communities in here. The place is good for small functions with 100 people capacity. If has monopoly in terms of food caterers & those serve good quality food. Food hygiene is little weak compared to the aesthetics of the banquet hall.
5,Recently I visited a jumboking dine-in outlet near mulund railway station at a walking distance of 5 minutes. The seating area is air conditioned and it has comfortable chairs and sofas. The staff is also friendly and welcoming. Great place to enjoy the burgers with comfortable seating.
1,On 12.03 am combo offer not given and charge for extra chese but chese not available. Also order sprit but given Cock.
1,"I really wish i could give negative stars for ambience and service. Average burgers. We were completely sweating inside, asked twice to turn on the ac but nobody did.
Also, individual burger menu is completely hidden on fridays when there is BOGO Offer tu upsell their meal combo. UNETHICAL AND BAD. Never go!"
4,"Very nice business turnaround by Jumboking ..
Now the Vadapav can compete & taste like burgers üî•üòõ
& They also have the Desi touch
You have Prompt service in this outlet üíØ....
Ordered a combo and would like to mention that all the combos here are pocket friendly and worthy of price"
5,This outlet is near by station... it serves the same Indian burger for which they are famous for... there are varieties in burger from which I tired plain cheese burger... it was upto the mark... taste was good... service is also good...
5,Good quality food each and every stuff available even Sukha bhel chutney also available.
4,"Nice quality products to eat like pav, variety of farsan, variety of murukku, everything that you can eat for light crunchy breakfast."
5,"Good place for Namkin, sweets and dry fruits"
5,Best place for all kind of snacks 5*
4,Good variety...but a crampy outlet
4,"This isn't a restaurant rather it's a small stall with few stools to sit on and eat. The hygiene may be questionable to some people.
I had ordered Paneer Malai Blast which was very filling by quantity and the taste was also good."
3,"We tried Matki dosa - taste wise it was good...
We also tried Mexican panini - which was full of sauces.. and if you like tangy sauces you could give it a try..

But I didn't like this much tangy sauce which was overshadowing the taste of bread or veggies everything..  i will give 1 star for this issue.."
5,"Worth trying food here . Which was very very yummy.

Must try balti Dosa & port dosa which for Ra.250/-.

This street is very busy street where there is no parking . As well as just few chairs r available.

Make sure u reach before 7.00pm or after 9.30pm"
5,"So it is one of the oldest Joint for Dosa, Sandwiches and panini that actually started concept of fusion Dosa in Mulund.
Located at 100 metra distance from Mulund station in west, is surrounded by various eatery options.
However, if you are looking for really great Dosa, panini, pizza, sandwiches then this is the place.

Please ignore photos, as same were captured late night in low light.
Otherwise food quality, quantity and owners response all are just great.
We had Italian panini, lays cheese mayo dosa and cheese blast sandwich"

5,"Really good ice cream!

I really loveddd Belgian Bites. Coconut icecream was good and it had real coconut pieces.

22nd of every month they provide ice cream at half price. We got lucky when we were visiting by chance and ate at 50% off!

Really loved apsara ice cream. I had heard the hype post it's story on social media and wanted to check it out. You should go too."
5,Apsara icecreams has one of the best and amazing varities of icecreams made from real milk and lovely fresh fruits. Guava icecream feels like literally you are having a fruit. Hygiene is maintained and I will surely recommend this superb place for having lovely icecreams.
4,"Recently visited Apsara ice creams after dinner for some dessert. We ordered two small Guava Glory for Rs 65 each.
Guava Glory consisted of Guava ice cream topped with red chilli masala.
Ice cream really tasted like Guava & masala on top just enhanced it's natural flavours.

Ordered scrumptious sitafal ice cream family pack from Apsara
Delivery was quick & pack was frozen.
Ice cream was in proper form.
love the flavours of Sitafal ice cream."
5,"Apsara Ice-cream üíö

5,"Apoorva Bar Restro in Mulund has quickly become one of my favorite spots in the area. I visited with a group of friends last weekend, and we were all impressed. The atmosphere is cozy and elegant, with just the right lighting to set a relaxed mood.

Blindly order anything veg or non veg ‚Äîevery bite is packed with flavor and I can assure you will be pleased. They also have great varieties of cocktails & mocktails ü§å

What really stood out was the service. The staff was attentive without being intrusive, and they made sure we had everything we needed. We even got some great recommendations on what to order, which made our experience even better.

If you‚Äôre in Mulund and looking for a place with delicious food, a great drink selection, and a welcoming vibe, Apoorva Fine Dine Bar Restro is the place to be. And the best part is it‚Äôs right outside the station!

We‚Äôll definitely be back!"
4,"Close to foot over bridge at mulund east. Best part open to sky space to sit and sip. Food & service is also good. Best place to drink eat and relax.

Most say a local bar however an elite in its competition.

I assure you visit and nothing to complain on food service and ambience.

Please do not complain for parking it's located next to the railway station. Common sense how can you expect it in Mumbai."
5,The ambience of this place is too good. Quite affordable price. Quality of the food is amazing. One must definitely try out this restaurant. Highly recommended.
1,"I bought dhokla from here, he was taking out the dhokla like mashing it with his hands and the taste of that dhokla was stale and chippy."
5,"Jalaram snacks is located at 5 rasta Mulund. This snacks center is great for the favourite food of Mumbaikars such as Dabeli, bhel, kachori, Sandwich, pani puri, dahi puri etc.

5,I like kachhi daveli very much n way serve also good
1,just don't go that place by eating their food I got high fever bcoz lack of cleanliness flies keep coming on your food
5,"Yesterday I ordered their new launch hazelnut cake. Very yummy and awesome taste. No cream and less sugary perfect for all ages.
We loved and enjoyed it."
1,Pineapple cake was very dry and cream wasn't good
1,"Dear All, I have got a worst experience with this shop. They swiped my credit card twice when I visited their shop on 28th April for buying a cake for my daughter on her birthday. Although I received the SMS confirmation for both the swipes, the shopkeeper said the second transaction will be refunded to you as the swipe machine has not printed slip. Actually the problem was their swipe machine was out of paper roll. He further told me that of you still get a debit charge by credit card, we will refund you which he never did even after my 10 follow ups. They later said that they revived only one payment but never showed their bank statement. I lost Rs 910 because of this. Such a cheater - my advise is to be careful in dealing with this shop."
5,Quality of cakes has improved. Good quality at affordable prices
1,Bad service.  They do not give a complements knife on an order of 1200.  Others in competition can go ahead due such attitude towards coustmers
4,Had an amazing time at Shiv Sagar! The ambiance was great and the food was delicious. Tried the pav bhaji fondue and it was absolutely amazing! Highly recommend it for a unique dining experience.
5,"I recently visited Shiv Sagar Restaurant in Mulund West and had an enjoyable dining experience. The evening began with crispy paneer and spring rolls, both of which were perfectly cooked and deliciously seasoned. The crispy paneer had a delightful crunch while remaining soft inside, and the spring rolls were fresh and flavorful, setting a high bar for the rest of the meal.

For the main course, I opted for the Chinese sizzler. The sizzler was a feast for the senses, arriving at the table with a dramatic sizzle and aromatic steam. The combination of noodles, vegetables, and sauces was well-balanced, making each bite a satisfying mix of textures and flavors.

To end the meal on a sweet note, I chose the sizzling brownie. The rich, warm brownie served with ice cream and topped with hot chocolate sauce was the perfect indulgence. The contrast between the hot brownie and the cold ice cream created a delightful harmony, making it a memorable dessert.

Overall, Shiv Sagar Restaurant offers a delightful culinary journey with its diverse menu and well-prepared dishes. The attentive service and vibrant ambiance add to the positive dining experience. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to enjoy a satisfying meal in Mulund West."
5,"Great place for family/corporate lunch/dinner. Two storey place with ample seating, they have very beautiful interiors on the top floor with AC seating. Food is good and quantity is good too. We ordered their Chinese items, like Paneer Chilly, mushroom Manchurian and fried rice with gravy - all in all a good place üíõ"
5,"A Legendary Shiv Sagar is a chain of Multi-Cuisine, Veg restaurants. Beautiful, insta worthy ambience, spacious seatings. Each corners are beautiful decorated. We went here for dinner, we tried their famous
‚ÄúCheese Pav Bhaji‚Äù Hot & Fresh. Bhaji was bit spicy & delicious in taste. Served with buttery Pavs! Highly Recommended.
Also had, ‚ÄúExotic Veg Sizzler‚Äù Love at first bite! Paneer, exotic veggies, baby corn, broccoli, rice/ noodles topped with sauces. It was delicious! Quantity served is enough for 2!
Some the recommended Mocktails,
‚ÄúBoo Boo Special‚Äù mix based drinks. Mix fruits. Highly Recommended!
‚ÄúWatermelon Mojito‚Äù mix of mint, lemon & watermelon. Delicious & Refreshing!

Overall a wonderful dinner experience. Staff was very helpful. A perfect place for family dining.
Visiting again soon!

Thankyou!"
5,"Shiv Sagar stands out as an exceptional dining destination, perfect for gatherings with friends or family. My culinary adventure at this establishment left me thoroughly impressed, especially with their delectable Jain cuisine. The Cheese Grill Sandwich, Manchurian, Sizzlers, Shakes, and Pav Bhaji, a renowned favorite, were all standout dishes that delighted my taste buds. While the fruit shakes and soup were Okieshh (Could be better) , but other dish on the menu showcased excellence in flavor and presentation. Shiv Sagar undoubtedly earns my recommendation for its consistently delightful dining experience."
1,"Had a black forest pastry here about a week back. It tasted really weird kind of like stale. It had a runny consistency and definitely didn't taste fresh. I finished the whole pastry , fortunately it didn't impact my health negatively but I could tell from the taste that it was definitely stale. Beware of this outlet and especially their black forest pastries. You may get sick if you eat stale cakes."
1,"I took black forest pastry from veena nagar outlet which had a foul smell .
Very bad quality"
1,I recently visited monginies cake shop at (vina nagar mulund west) and was very disappointed with quality of their cake. The cake did not appear fresh which impacted both test and overall experience I would recommend please dont buy it from this shop
4,"Most oldest and known place for cake lover's ‚ù£Ô∏è I was craving for some delicious chocolate from long time so visited Monginis for some tasty pastries.

Thought of trying something new so bought their chocolate bomb and it was lit, chocolaty enough, good smooth texture and cravings were satisfied üòç Staff was supportive and good service.

Swish delight pastry was for Rs.45/-
Chocolate Bomb : Rs.35/-

Worth try they had other flavours too üôÇ
Thank You ‚ú®"
4,"Was craving for a Red velvet pastry...
Monginis has got delightful red velvet pastry!! The moment I took a bite of it literally started melting in my mouthüòã the sponge was super moist and overall it was an amazing experience !!"
4,"The service was wonderful, with the servers informing about the happy hours offers, the food equally delicious. They have a physical menu (multiple actually). The reason for reducing one star is Ms. Purva at the entrance who was extremely rude, mannerless, and unwelcoming."
5,"Good Food, ambiance was good. Food was tastewise perfect. Manjeet was our server n he was humble n helpful. Staff was  professional n we enjoyed our dinner here. Ordered paneer malai tikka which was delicious. The portion was enough for 4 people. The main course was mouthwatering. N yes starters u must try. They have Two menus one is urben tadka North Indian n other is pop tates American n Italian. Wide variety of options to choose. So must visit for weekend dinner."
4,This outlet has been in business for almost 20 years and I believe there has been a change in management. The service levels have definitely compared to what it was earlier but it is still good. The theme earlier was more around Family-based with mainly Punjabi cuisine. Now they have removed the partition between Pop Tates and Urban Tadka which has made it a nosier place making it difficult to have conversations. The service staff was excellent earlier and although that too has seen a bit of a drop but is still very good. The menu has a lot of options for veg as well as non-veg. They have more than one big screen tv sets to screen sports matches. There is ample parking in the mall.
3,Urban tadka's seating space is merged with Pop Tates restaurant though the food is served as per the menu of respective restaurants. The ambience of Urban tadka was different & had a good vibe which was lost. Pop taste has a different vibe & people come there for that culture. The food is good though pricing is little on the higher side.
1,"I am frequent visitor of urban tadka rmall in mulund.. and they have degraded allot.. before the taste amd the quantity and quality were the best so i preferred it..but now on my recent visit the taste has changed .. the quality has degraded also the quantity has been decreased allot . We ordered chicken briyani (most preferred dish) and this time i m allot disappointed by the briyani which was served .. did not expect this from urban tadka... üëéüëé
Then we ordered from pop tates .. that briyani was much much better than urban tadka's briyani..
The below picture is of roasted chicken briyani from poptates"
5,"One of the best in Mulund west very authentic style dhoklas since 1976, i call them Dr.dhoklas because they are the ogs and the experts and specialist in dhoklas, i personally like nylon dhoklas so tasty it is that you cant stop eating them, also they have kept a stall of chaas outside there store for free, for the people who are suffering in heat summers. God bless them"
5,Superb quality on all the varieties of dhokla and Khaman and value for money
5,"I am the third generation in my family to eat Jalaram Khaman Mart‚Äôs Dhokla . My father still brings dhokla from their shop every sunday and my whole family enjoys it . Every special occasion, holiday and sometimes without even any special day their dhokla‚Äôs is a must ‚ú®üëå. We have tasted almost every single item of their and that authentic gujarati taste never makes us disappointed. Owner is very polite and graceful . He always welcome‚Äôs us with a smile üòä."
4,Best Khaman in Mumbai for any family function.
5,Very old  and authentic dhokla and  khaman place in mulund and have a great taste
4,"This is one of the oldest dabeli centers of Mulund, one thing I love about this place is its hygienic environment.
Also, the taste it too good to resist... I absolutely enjoy eating their dabeli!ü§§‚ù§"
5,Can't thank my stars enough that since more than 20 yrs out Dabeli Uncle is serving us non stop üéäüòáüòä
5,Very very tasty Dabeli üòã in Mulund East.......
3,One of the oldest street vendors in mulund selling dabeli. It is located near Hanuman chowk in mulund East. The taste is just superb. Prices are reasonable. Quality is very good. Also the vendor is very humble.
5,This is best Dabeli joint ever! We have tried many places but keep coming back to Joshi Dabeli House. The taste has been consistent over the years! It‚Äôs a nice clean place - very hygienic! Service is quick and very good! It‚Äôs a must try if you are around Mulund East!
1,"Literally the worst experience ordering from dominos. My order number was 303 and i had ordered it on 17 feb. I had ordered 700 worth ruppees order. Something which i don't normally order. I ordered medium size cheese and corn, 2 stuffed garlic bread, 2 cheese dips, and one chocolava cake. Now the pizza was soo small  like so small, and it looked like it was sitting for a day, it was not hot, and literally no cheese, I had ordered a medium size pizza, that pizza was so worst that even a 100 rs pizza would have been better. After that the stuffed garlic bread,  it had literally zero cheese inside, like some were there, but mostly didn't. It was a 700 ruppees meal payed for. When I reached them for a refund, there is no response from them. I felt like I have been cheated, they said they will call within 24 hours, but today's it's 19th. I request don't ever order from here, literally the worse service till date. Dominoz if you are reading this, my order number is 303 and I had ordered from mulund east. But I guess I don't even think there  is any use  writing here."
1,"had a really disappointing experience with Domino‚Äôs. The pizza arrived late and was barely warm. The crust was soggy, and the toppings were sparse and unevenly spread. To make things worse, the customer service was helpful when I called to complain but the staff was rude Definitely not worth the money‚Äîwon‚Äôt be ordering again from this branch."
4,Domino's Mulund is 10 minute walking Mulund station. The place is a bit small. The service is good. The staff is polite. It is very crowded on weekends. I always prefer home deliveries. My personal favorite are chicken sausage and chicken tikka. Even the pizza is good. Sometimes some pizzas are not available.
5,"Amazing place to visit after shift n if u r cheese lover the here you go, these is the place were you u will get melted cheese in and out of the pizza. The crust is called cheese burst crust. Seriously guys it will take you heaven. Also order for choco lava cake. Perfect end of food or I would say perfect end of the day am sure once have it will u forget other desserts."
1,"I had an extremely disappointing experience with this particular Domino's branch, especially with the branch manager. I placed an order through Swiggy, and the total amount shown was Rs 181, which included packaging charges, taxes, and delivery fees. However, when the order arrived, Domino's handed me a bill for Rs 244. Despite explaining the discrepancy, the manager (on phone) was unyielding and refused to listen. They insisted I pay Rs 244 and were very rude
in their communication. When I suggested they contact Swiggy to resolve the issue, they dismissively said, ""It's your problem, just pay us."" I reached out to Swiggy, and they confirmed I only needed to pay Rs 191.

I was completely let down by Domino's approach, particularly the manager, who even hung up the phone when I asked for their name. Terrible service!"

5,Nice and different. Taste was awesome üëå. Definitely going to visit again.
4,"We were loyal Bawarchi customers n were wanting to try Modern culture for quite some time. So today when we had a chance we decided to visit. The ambience is amazing. The place is totally Instagrammable. N I totally loved the new menu. We tried the Pina colada, mushroom chilli dry, tandoori broccoli n the asparagus tempura sushi. The Pina colada was a bit disappointing but everything else was just too good. The portion size was generous, taste amazing n presentation perfect. The staff was courteous n very active. We had a great time n would love to visit again."
5,You love food then you must visit this place for the most amazing tasty food which is pleasing for the mouth and soothing to the eyes. You will definitely feel like coming back
5,Loved the new ambiance. Food quality and quantity both value for money.
5,"Naturals mulund east, is a great spot to visit with your loved ones. The ambience is great and the staff here is also amazing. The variety of flavours is just amazing. Also, they have started a new segment in which they introduce new flavours each week for a limited time. One must consider trying them out. It's worth every single penny. They say good food good mood SO DO VISIT AND MAKE YOURSELF HAPPY."
4,Great ice cream option. Known for various fruit ice cream flavours. Season wise fruits ice cream flavours are available. Choco Chip I find it all time favourite with good bite size chocolate chips in it.
5,Their Ice-cream quality is good. They have a good variety of flavours. Bit high on price but it's fine as the quality and taste is good. Always a reliable outlet for eating ice-creams.
5,"Great place for hanging out with friends, family or loved ones. Ice cream lovers can not skip this place if they are around it. Me and my friend tried out 3 flavours 1. Jackfruit 2. Anjeer 3. Coffee walnut

Jackfruit tasted just like the ‡§´‡§£‡§∏‡§™‡•ã‡§≥‡•Ä or ‡§´‡§£‡§∏‡§æ‡§ö‡•á ‡§∏‡§æ‡§† called in marathi.

Anjeer flavour had natural taste of anjeers.

Coffee walnut was best in all of them. Taste of coffee and walnut pieces in it made it a great , tasty desert."
2,"Staffs are very very rude..not welcoming..not answering..always irritated..as if they are providing free service.. every time we visit same things happening..no change of conduct..
However icecreams are yummy but quantity is so less for 80 rs..
Owner of this shop pls kindly take action against the behaviour of your staff.."
5,"Had a lovely experience at Atithi All Day Dining! The ambiance was warm and welcoming, perfect for both casual meals and special occasions. The food was fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented‚Äîespecially the Indian dishes which had that authentic home-style touch. The service was attentive and polite, without being overbearing.

Even though I don't drink, I noticed their bar was well-stocked and quite popular. Fun fact I didn‚Äôt know before: Most wines actually get better with age because of a natural chemical process that softens the tannins and enhances the flavors‚Äîkind of like magic in a bottle!

Overall, a great place for a relaxed and satisfying meal. Would definitely recommend it to friends and family!"
5,"Had a wonderful time at Atithi All Day Dining! The atmosphere was cozy and inviting‚Äîgreat for everything from laid-back lunches to celebrating special moments. The menu was diverse and the food stood out with its fresh ingredients and authentic flavors, especially the Indian selections that reminded me of comforting, home-cooked meals.

Though I don‚Äôt drink, I was impressed by their well-stocked bar, which seemed to be a hit among guests. Fun fact I came across: aging wine improves its taste as time allows tannins to mellow and the complex flavors to develop‚Äîalmost like nature‚Äôs own recipe.

All in all, it‚Äôs a lovely spot with great food, warm service, and a relaxed vibe. Would happily visit again and recommend it to others!"
1,"Last weekend, I visited a restaurant that seemed promising because of its beautiful ambience. The decor and atmosphere were quite impressive, creating a cozy and inviting vibe. Unfortunately, the experience fell apart quickly. We arrived at 7:30 PM and had to wait for over 30 minutes just to get our food. The delay would have been acceptable if the food was good, but sadly, it wasn‚Äôt. None of the dishes we ordered tasted good, and the flavors were bland and disappointing. It felt like no effort was put into preparing the meals.

To make matters worse, the service was slow and inattentive. We came by 7:30pm and left at 10:45 PM, the entire evening felt like a waste of time and money. Despite the nice ambience, the poor food quality and bad service ruined the experience. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal or a pleasant outing."
4,Located next to Mulund station. Food was nice. Ambience is ok.
1,"Me and family had gone to this restaurant last year. I had a bad experience and till now it hurts me. We had food. The food was good. We used swiggy dine out to pay the bill. The owner I guess was present there, there was a waiter near him. They were so upset because we got a discount through swiggy. The face they made, it was very disrespectful. There are waiters there, who think they own the restaurant. Very disrespectful. When we left, I saw they were murmuring about us just because we use dine out discount. Very disrespectful. Never ever visiting there. The name atithi doesn't suit them. They are concerned only about money."
4,"Best cold  coffee, cappuccino but didn‚Äôt like the mocha latte and vanillacoffee. Perfect taste, perfectly strong and less sweet"
4,"Always a preferred place to hangout, grab a coffee & spend time here with friends.. Some of the new additions of dessert options & mini croissants are good. Cold coffee & Cappuccino are goto drinks üòä Staff is also good & cooperative."
5,Food quality is not that good I have ordered garlic bread but garlic bread is not fresh and coffee is good and croissants is good and atmosphere is too good and ambiance is beautiful üòç
4,Cafe Coffee Day is a good place to visit especially with your Friends/family and ofcourse even if you are alone üòÑ. So Varieties of coffee and you can order the cup of coffee as you want‚ò∫Ô∏è and some breakfast you will find over to make your day
4,"Enjoyed the ambience and cleanliness of the place. Although much of the stuff in menu was not available on Sunday evening, I enjoyed my cold coffee. Quick service and polite behaviour of staff always makes the day better."
1,"I could have easily given this outlet as a 4 star rating at least.  However considering my experience and their professionalism, I want want to give only one star to this outlet.

First of all the basic hospitality is a miss.  Forget about greeting their customers, they didn't welcome us with the drinking water.  Moreover , the staff was not even in and around when we were supposed to place our order they were somewhere on the upper deck.

Seating arrangement is not pretty good.  The cushions are untidy.

The food is not even up to the mark the quality is completely out of the question.  It is OK for the college going students but not for the families like us.

Lastly that I should definitely let the people know is about their carelessness and lack of professionalism.  I had ordered momos and half of the portion was left hence I requested them to pack it.  They never bothered to return me back that packet while I was billing.  When I call them next morning they told me they had kept it till 12 a.m and they threw it off.  They never bother to compensate me for this even after convincing them so many times.  I was even ok to get the same half portion even if it was refrigerated but they threw it off.  Sorry to the owner but I was really disappointed.

Definitely no no again."
1,"Menu is vast but prices are just too high for the quantity they offer.. fries were good but that‚Äôs just basic. For 2 people with ordering 3 dishes and 3 drinks price was 1240 .. momos were bland and chewy.. all the dishes are priced in range of 200 upto 350.. also the place is just too small and sitting chair is uncomfortable too‚Ä¶ there are many more places in mulund which serve great quantity of food with quality and reasonable pricing too!

Just look at the pullapart bread .. some fries could have been added to fill up the space but the bread is just too smallüòê
Only overpriced cafe‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
The hazelnut coffee was super strong and too sweet.. had to leave it halfway"
3,"I ordered the Paneer Tikka Pizza from Swiggy with extra veggies and cheese, but it was disappointing. Even after paying ‚Çπ495, it didn‚Äôt feel like extra cheese was added at all. The pizza base was hard, and the overall taste was flat. Honestly, the regular version I had earlier (without extra toppings) was much better.

Paying extra didn‚Äôt improve the quality‚Äîit actually felt worse this time. Not worth the price. Hope they take more care with customization and quality."
5,Amazing experience and pocket friendly cafe with good Vibes and variety of options available and the staff is too sweet and nice... Over-all a great experience!
4,"Perfect place for hanging out with friends or going on a date. Tried their pizza, pasta, noodles,garlic bread, fries, waffles,etc and every dish was yum. Overall food is delicious and ambience is also nice."
4,"1) Food Quality-Excellent, fresh, and flavorful dishes.

2)Portion Size-Generous servings, well-balanced.

3)Variety-Wide range of options catering to different tastes.

4)Service-Prompt and courteous staff.

5)Ambiance-Cozy and inviting atmosphere.

6)Value for Money-Worth the price for the quality provided.

7)Cleanliness-Restaurant and kitchen maintained impeccably.

Overall, a highly satisfying dining experience."
4,"Mulund East's one of the oldest and better pure veg restaurants, offering an extensive menu that spans South Indian, North Indian, and Chinese cuisines. The restaurant has both AC and non AC sections. A drawback is that they inflated prices of soft drinks and water by labeling it as 'with service'.
Be prepared for potential wait times on weekends."
5,"A well defined establishment for food. The ambience is good, the waiting is very good. Staff behavior is very good. Take out and delivery services are very good. I tried their chinese cuisine in the rains and it was delicious. A must visit place for not only MULUNDITES but for others too."
4,The ambience was great i liked the food also but if you are a spicy lover make sure to tell them if you want your food spicy or whatever spice level you want becoz their food spice level is normal. The taste was good you will find all at reasonable price and service was also good.
5,"Campus hotel is one of the best places in Mulund for vegetarian food. A good place to dine in with family & friends. Menu covers almost everything like punjabi, southindian, chinese, pavbhaji, snacks, juices etc. They serve absolutely delicious food. Quantity of the food is too good & prices are also appropriate. Service is very speedy, staff is quite efficiently handling the orders. Ambience & atmosphere also has a good vibe. Ac & non ac both the sections are available with good amount of seating. Hotel is quite easily accessible as it's situated at Navghar road. One can visit this place when in Mulund."
3,Good service good portions. Nice glass cutlery. Tried Thai green curry with steemed rice with more than expected thick consistency. Curry was sugar sweet and with milk cream which should not be. Also for steemed rice it should not be biryani long grain rice. Chicken Manchow soup was good. Happy that there was no ajinomoto or less use of ajinomoto.
5,forget the nameof dish but kind of veg Coconut soup game strong! Loved trying out the different dishes
4,"Pocket friendly restaurant with nice ambience. Variety of dishes with Good Quantity. Spice level is moderate. We ordered Sizzled chilly jumbo prawns which they recommended was super tasty and were in big size. We also had soup, chicken lollipop and chicken triple rice. Service was quick and staff was friendly. I recommend to visit this place with friends."
5,"Kampa chinese restaurant is purely chinese cuisine. You may get here various kinds of chinese dishes.

The service is good and food also hygenic and delicious.

The restaurant situated in main road therefore free Street parking is available for your two wheelers but for four wheeler parking you have to find out near about.

Washroom facility is not available in restaurant but they accomodate you the facility with their joint restaurant near about 100 meter distance.

Wheelchair facility is not available but wheelchair accessibility in restaurant."
5,We had sizzlers for our team dinner. We ordered one veg and one chicken sizzler for 8 people and their quantity was for at least 10 people. Food was delicious and fulfilling. You must try their mini mocktails. I liked guava.
1,"Visited after a long time. The food and the service has DETERIORATED. Very poor service and food quality. Ordered a Chinese bhel for Rs 150 and it was a total rip off. Too oily, not at all fresh and quantity too small. 150 is too much for such a small potion size. What you get for your money is total waste. Never gonna visit again. Try some other chinese restaurant. All rates have almost doubled as compared to 2-3 years ago and the quality has been degraded."
1,Don‚Äôt even wish to give one star.This is the third time I called to order and every time what they do is take the order and address and call you back asking you to pickup your order or wait until their delivery guy comes who can only deliver after 8 pm.When you ask to cancel your order the lady staff is just so fine with it‚Ä¶I mean no regrets at all.Disgusting why don‚Äôt you just shut down rather than treating so weirdly.On that it‚Äôs never 25 percent full and they show you such attitude.Trash service and hospitality.
1,"Worst experience.. lot of colour in rice‚Ä¶ unnatural

Never visit
Ordered china garden special rice‚Ä¶
Location mulund east‚Ä¶ opposite palm acres society .

P.S they dont give schezwan sauce with dpecial rice"
1,They took 5 rs for soya souch worst behaviour from the owner ...this hotel should be banned in MulunD east
3,Taste is goos not best . I ordered paneer spring roll and Singapore rice. I found it little costly then other chineese restaurants..
4,"New variant of 6 in 1 was a good one
Not just the price but the options and quality was good - for a change... Enjoyed Dominos pizza after many many years (hopefully back to regain their past glory)"
5,"üçïDOMINO'S üçï
Try different outlet for pizza then you will come to know what is actual pizza is.
.
Best pizzas ever.
.
Visited domino's almost after 3 months nd came to know what i was missing.
.
Awesome taste. And fast service.
.
We had crikling fries which was good in taste but expensive."
4,Its been around for quite a while now. Good customer service and good place to hang out. Had a really fresh and yummy chicken fiesta cheese burst pizza and choco lava cake (though personally I feel the lava cake could have had more molten chocolate inside).
4,"Wanted to explore the menu a little so I had ordered a veggie paradise pizza.
The pizza slice was heavy full of toppings but with a very little amount of cheeseüòÇ
But not gonna lie there was a generous amount of toppings, majorly olives.üòã
Overall was an amazing experience ü§©"
3,The pizza is average and toppings especially non veg aren't all that much. Prefer the sides since they are different and provide a better experience. The bathrooms are more for employees who are a real pain on usage. Very badly kept toilets and flies are a constant problem
5,Rare gem of a resturant in busy Mumbai Parel area. Service and food both are above the par. Very friendly staffs. Worth a visit every time when I come to Mumbai . We stayed in ITC central but the food tasted better here than ITC.
4,"Food- Quality and Quantity of food is good and taste is also good I had ordered paneer tikka masala it was medium spicy
Service -  The staff is friendly, attentive
Ambience - Ambience of the  restaurant is simply fantastic! ..They maintain environment clean and hygiene you can come with family and  friend"
4,Food tastes really good and has a variety of options. Dessert is a must try. It has been a go to place for doctors. Hygiene and quality is well maintained. Only drawback is sometimes the place feels overcrowded.
5,Rakesh aana is very good person and food taste is very excellent all are very friendly
5,"Really amazing food over here so many veg options and variety üòãüòãüòã

We had lucknowy biryani, Soya chop biryani, sev bhaji, panir bagicha,
And falooda

All of this was delicious üòãüòãüòãüòãüòã

I can say fully 4stars to all of the food

So go here anytime
And have fun with the food
Really yummy food they have and good quality hygiene ü§ó

1,"I am extremely disappointed with the service I received from Domino's. I ordered chicken wings, and they arrived in poor condition. After returning them for a replacement, I received the same subpar wings. It's frustrating to deal with repeated issues and a lack of improvement. This experience has certainly affected my trust in their service, and I surely won't be visiting again. I've included a photo to illustrate the problem‚Äîbe the judge."
5,"Love to be here...Great service. I order online and there is always super quick delivery, nice staff and great food. Can be relied upon every time... Quick, hot and yummy every time. Lots of topping, cooked like you request. Definitely my ""go to"" for good Pizza. This is a good small business. The pizza is fresh and the staff seem to be typical high school students. Don't ask for too much of a variation on toppings because they don't..."
1,"Domino in India not much to expect , but since the outlet is in high end location I expected a decent experience  but unfortunately  it was bad can't blame the staff but the management. When we talk about an international  brand expectations are high because the bill is high but majority domino or in that sense even pizza hut we feel any one can enter kitchen and make pizza there no big deal, shame fully it's not different from any other road side pizza stall. Very bad , unorganized, short staff,unclean cooking area. Highly not recommended  only if you want to waste money and mood kindly visit. It's time international  food brands stops fooling customers and we customers too should stop letting them take us and our hard earned money for granted. Definetly  not recommended."
1,"Since 2 days I'm trying to order from domino's... but the store is kept on offline services Im expecting mom and its very hard to stop those pregnancy cravings. Instead of sending apologise you should instead arrange the delivery if we are so valued customers. The deliveries are available only after 9pm to 12am... Are you guys sleeping in the morning slots that you cannot deliver the orders keep your guarantee delivery tagline aside but atleast start taking up orders who wish to eat are unable to due to some technical glitch with the lower parel phenonix store... very disappointing service.

Suggestion: if you guys don't have delivery person atleast allow zomato or swiggy to deliver the item... people who cannot drop by for dining or takeaways won't be allowed to enjoy their favorite meals. How disappointing is that?"
1,If you don't want to spoil your mood and spend money on food which is not up to the standards then please avoid ordering from Dominos. They literally don't care about the quality of the food. You will not receive freshly cooked food after spending your hard earned money. Try ordering from local restaurants.
5,"‚ÄúAER is hands down one of the best rooftop lounges in Mumbai! The breathtaking panoramic view of the city skyline, paired with a fantastic ambiance, makes it the perfect spot for a night out. The cocktails were expertly crafted, and the food was delicious. The staff was attentive and ensured a great experience. Whether you‚Äôre looking for a romantic evening or a place to unwind with friends, AER is a must-visit. Highly recommended!‚Äù"
5,"AER at Four Seasons Mumbai is easily one of the most iconic rooftop venues in the city. The panoramic views, especially at sunset, are breathtaking, and the atmosphere strikes the perfect balance between lively and sophisticated. The cocktails were excellent, and the service was smooth and attentive throughout the evening.

We especially appreciated the presence of Om, whose well-dressed, polished demeanor and gracious manner added a personal touch to the experience. It‚Äôs clear he brings both professionalism and warmth to the team. Looking forward to returning soon!

Ciao ciao!"
5,"One of the best sky lounges in Mumbai located on the 34th floor of four seasons hotel.
Well curated food and drinks
Very prompt and attentive service
Best place to view the sunset
Great atmosphere and vibes"
3,"Our sundowner experience started on a sour note. We had booked through Zomato to celebrate our anniversary, but unfortunately, the restaurant initially denied our booking. However, with the manager's intervention, we were allocated two rather awkward seats with a poor view. Thankfully, our waiter assisted us in shifting to better seats after we requested.

The mocktails were delightful, and the prawns were scrumptious, but the chicken dish fell short of our expectations. Additionally, the service was sluggish, and we noticed that the bill included a drink that was never served to us.

Despite these issues, we thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance. On the downside, the valet service was also disappointing, particularly with an app that failed to provide real-time updates."
5,"AER has always had a reputation for its breathtaking views, but this visit truly made it special for me. I went during sunset, and trust me, there‚Äôs absolutely no better time to be there. The golden hues reflecting off the city skyline and the sea breeze brushing past while you sip on a drink‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the kind of moment that makes you pause and just feel.

I started with a Matcha mocktail, curious to try something refreshing yet different. The bartender asked me how I liked it, and I said it was good and to my surprise, he smiled and came back with another one on the house! That little gesture of kindness really stood out. It wasn‚Äôt just about the drink; it was the thoughtfulness behind it. Shoutout to Imli and Harshal for the lovely complimentary drink, it truly made my day.

For food, I ordered the Margherita pizza, and it hit the spot. Perfectly crisp, not too heavy, and the flavors were beautifully balanced. It paired so well with the ambiance, laidback yet classy.

A special mention to Tanaji, who not only served us with a smile but also helped click some lovely photos during sunset. It‚Äôs rare to find staff who go the extra mile, and everyone here made me feel welcome, relaxed, and cared for.

Overall, AER isn‚Äôt just a rooftop lounge with a view, it‚Äôs an experience. Whether you‚Äôre there for the drinks, the vibes, or just to soak in a peaceful sunset over Mumbai, this place delivers on every front. Can‚Äôt wait to visit again!"

First of All ITC Grand Central is a fantastic property and all its stores inside and restaurants is top notch too. We just went in for Lunch and the food we ordered was excellent , all basic ones like Dal , Mixed Vegetables , Fresh Lime , Rotis and so on. Quick , very tasty , well served and delightful experience. Would certainly visit again and I was even told that the room tariffs are quite economical considering that its a 5 Star property.  So It could be looked at even for guests or self for stay or dining or premium shopping."

The best part about this place was the bite sized ‚Äúhalf‚Äù portions so that u can try more dishes at a time without being too full every time you order something new,ideal for someone with a small appetite and perfect to satisfy those sudden hunger cravings.
I rarely write a review but this place is mention worthy.
So we started with a half  soup ,then we ordered prawn peri peri dry (real spicy for all the spice lovers),half chicken double pepper dry and to end with half Thai curry rice .
We were two and the total we paid was just 600 including two mineral water bottles and trust me the food was really really good!

I won't exaggerate but trust me this place serves you the best Chinese food you'd ever have in Mumbai at such affordable price. The restaurant is quite small and cozy, well maintained and hygenic. The staff and the managers are very friendly, courteous and polite. If you are looking for lip smacking appetizers you should go for Dragon chilli gravy which will definitely boost your appetite.I would highly recommend to try there Chicken kepsa which is worth the money. Apart from non-vegetarian delicacies they have wide variety of vegetarian food as well, out of which the Veg burnt garlic chilli rice is on point. Last but not the least the caramel custard is yum to end your meal with.
I wish there were more stars to rating above. ‚≠ê √ó üíØ"

Recently visited the Lalbaug outlet of Laadu Samrat and to my surprise, It was a good experience !

Order might take time due to high volume of customers but for food, we can wait right ?

So I ordered, Vada Misal Pav(coz its one of my fav), Toast Sandwich coz Mom wanted to eat and Batata Bhaji Plate because why not ?

Vada Misal Pav was 4 out of 5, it could've been better if the Rassa was a bit spicy, basically when it comes to Misal, it has to be Spicy but maybe its the potato in the Vada that made it a bit sweet but the taste was tempting and it was kind of worth it to have ! The Buns(Pav) are giant so make sure you are empty if u want to order extra buns !

Toast Sandwich was 4.5 out of 5 because Mom liked it a lot, she expressed when we reached home even. It had perfect ingredients and no extra fillings to pop out of the sandwich ! The green chutney had that spark to keep having it with each bite along with good amount of spices in the sandwich !

Batata Bhaji(‡§≠‡§ú‡•ç‡§ú‡•Ä) was 4 out of 5 because it was oily. No doubt I like this dish a lot but this one had an extra amount of oil which had an option to avoid if they took care of the oil on the ‡§≠‡§ú‡•ç‡§ú‡•Ä. For sure they will work on this or I'll let them know, was hungry and in rush so din't informed them but manageable !

Overall the experience at the outlet was good ! Good going team ‡§≤‡§æ‡§°‡•Ç‡§∏‡§Æ‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§ü! Kudos to the chef and the management !

Guy_with_361r"
4,Were treated like royalty by the management. Thanks. Family says Misal here is better than next doors martand. if you have to choose one then choose this. On same par as thanes mamledar.
4,"The Lalbagh is famous for Ganpati and ladu, smart Maharashtrian authentic food. They serve more than 300 items of different types of Maharashtrian food, South Indian food as well. The service is fast, and you don't have to wait, but you may have to wait in queue sometimes because there are always people standing outside. A good time to visit is in the morning or evening."
4,One of the oldest Maharashtrian restaurant in the Lalbaug area food taste good sometimes little crowded
5,"This place become favorite for Maharashtrian snacks. I tested Batatavada/kat vada taste is great, crisp in of best vada i ate in Mumbai. If you want to taste best misal in mumbai visit this place. Kothimbir wadi, Samosa, Piyush are also great in taste.
Must visit if you are near lalbaugh -paral dadar"
5,Very excellent Cake
5,"A Simple Cake is just what I wanted but it was so much more. It was beautiful, elegant and delicious!"

2,"7 spice üçΩÔ∏è

This place is located near income tax office, Parel which is 10 min away from lower Parel station.

The ambiance of this place is okay, somewhat comfortable. The staff of this place is friendly but the service is very slow.

What I tried

Chicken double black pepper

The chicken was soft and juicy but excessive amount of salt ruined my experience. üòñ

Chicken Pot rice (in dragon sauce)

Visually it looked amazing but the rice wasn't cooked properly. It had some good amount of veggies and chicken in it. Taste was okayish.

Chicken Fried rice

Once again it was not cooked properly.It Just looks good visually.

Veg schezwan rice

comparatively this was better than the above three mentioned above.

Note: this place uses hell lot of MSG (Monosodium glutamate) in all the dishes.

Food: 1.5/5

Service: 2/5

Ambiance: 2.5/5"
5,"Visited here with my family, tried out Gobi lolipop, Chapta chicken ( dish of the day), Chilli coriander rice ( Dish of the day as well ) , Loved the taste, quality and quantity. No fake food coloring used. The owner and staff were both really attentive and had a great convo. Also offered free tea
Overall good experience"
1,we are regular customer of 7 spice but today we order chicken lollipop gravy and schezwan fried rice lollipop was very hard to eat... and rice was not at all good it was smelling a lot so we given a complaint to the hotel and their replace it means they agree that particular rice was not good...
4,The place is located in parel .. which is Chinese speciality ... They serve good quality food but the seating capacity is less which is drawback. Over all good experience and yes they don't have parking space .
1,Holly crispy chili compair to price smallest quantity and test worst .bad experience.
5,This eatery is more than 50 years old old. It is a Decent place for a pocket friendly meal. The best part is they are open all day. So even at 4 pm you can go and have lunch there. A veg thali cost Only Rs. 60. Which includes. 2 bowl bhaji. 1 bowl dal. 2 Chapatis. 1 big bowl rice. Also non veg options are available too. Opens till 9 pm in the evng.
5,"This is more of a takeaway place than a proper restaurant, managed by a group of ladies Just a couple of tables are available for dining in. Customers prefer to stand patiently in a long queue, rather than eating here. Daily menu is displayed near the counter.  They serve Maharashtrian cuisine.

We ordered egg thali and surmai thali. We chose ragi bhakri instead of chapati. Both the thalis were fresh and tasty. Price is on the lower side. We saw batches of fish fry getting over in a matter of minutes.  This eatery is very popular with the locals.

A visit is recommended while in the area. Be aware that seating is very limited. They accept UPI payment."
3,Nice homemade food restaurant near KEM hospital and Parel ESI Hospital. Both Non Vegetarian and Vegetarian food is available. Sea food is the speciality made in typical Konkani style. Thali is also a good option. Hygiene is the issue but rate is very reasonable. Many types of Indian breads are available
4,Best place for who people's are far from home & want same like home food. Extremely budget friendly & taste is very good. Must try kothimbir wadi.
4,Because my office is nearby I regularly visit here. All staffs are very supportive and polite.Food quality is satisfactory and price is low.
3,"I remember visiting this restaurant 8-10 years back and actually it's really famous for its vade chicken dish. But after renovation I cannot understand why their food quality has detoriorated. I recently visited on a Saturday and we asked for 2-3 dishes from the menu which weren't available during that hour. Ordered paneer chilli for parcel which was good.Then, we order chicken thali and mutton thali which is costly enough but the quantity they offered was not worth it and even the chicken was more of bones with only 2-3 pieces within a gravy which was more of garam masala and not so tasty."
2,"Had been to this restaurant for dinner. The place was empty at that time as it was quite early.

Ordered chicken thali. The chicken curry that came with the thali had four pieces which hardly had any meat in it. Looked like the meat was carved out for some other dish. Though the portion of rice and the chicken gravy was generous, the gravy was loaded with spices. Taste was lost in the overdose of spices.

Service was not upto the mark. Waiter was behaving as if he was doing a favour.

Everything in the menu looked overpriced for a restaurant of their stature. Don't think I will step in again."
3,"Surmai thali is good
Chicken was over cooked. Dried. Dhaga chicken"
3,"The ambiance is good. Clean and tidy place . The staff is prompt.

Things that we tried :
Chicken Thali : 4/5
Surmai Thali : 3/5
Shimplya thali : 4/5
Prawns Fry : 2/5 very Okish.
Prawns masala : 3/5
Bombil Fry : 4/5
Solkadi : 4/5
Kombadi wade : 4/5

Visited in lunch time . No waiting. No Parking."
2,"During our recent visit to the hotel, we opted for the chicken crispy, and while the taste was pleasant, I must express my dissatisfaction with the excessive oil content. It was so oily that I experienced a headache post-consumption. Moving on to the assorted thalis we ordered ‚Äì the chicken, mutton, and veg variations fell short of delivering an exceptional taste. The Vada, in particular, lacked the desired quality. Despite these culinary shortcomings, the interior, skillfully curated by a talented architect, provided a visually pleasing ambience. However, it is worth noting that the seating arrangement, especially on the left side, felt congested and somewhat uncomfortable. In summary, while the culinary experience left room for improvement, the commendable interior design contributed positively to our overall impression of the establishment.

4,"We had been there for our Anniversary dinner.  There 3 or 4 restaurant in the hotel we chose the Kabab and Kurry and I should say we chose the best. The ambience is great from lighting to decor to the comfortable seats. They have limited menu but a offer good options in veg and nonveg- Fish, mutton and Chicken. We ordered fish starter is was well marinated in mustard sauce and aptly cooked, ordered twister mocktail and  bihari nalli mutton gravy which had good pieces and  a gravy which could be enjoyed both with rice and breads. We ordered couple of kulch and naan. The food was sumptuous.
One thing that stands out at ITC than other 5start hotels the taste of food is authentic and the staff is very courteous. We were assisted by Shubham and Murli. They nit even guided us with what's best to order as well as Murli understanding that is was our Anniversary got us a cake which made our day. Special shout out to both of them. Highly recommended!"
4,"Excellent service and an absolute food experience. Nice place for time spine and relax. The ambience was good, food was excellent, Chef has recommended specially dal makhani and mix grill with bread. The kulfi was ordinary. Tandoori aloo starter was different and something I had never eaten before. The pudina paranthe waa good.  Love it.  Thank you team K&K for great hospitality. Keep it up."
5,"I'm a fan of well done Indian course meals where some serious effort has been put into planning and preparing it. That's what I found here. We tried the vegetarian and the non-vegetarian course meals and they were simply outstanding. The staff is helpful, but could learn a bit more about gourmet food pairing, descriptions, etc. However, they ensured they answered my queries in a satisfying manner and consult the chef when they couldn't. The famous atleast 72 hours long cooked Daal Bukhara, deserved the respect it has acquired. A lovely addition to my favourite places in Mumbai."
4,Doesn't match up to the Bukhara in delhi. However it's still pretty good. I ate the veg fixed menu and highlight was the beetroot galauti kabab. The kulfi was ordinary. Tandoori aloo starter was different and something I had never eaten before. The pudina paranthe waa good. However very disappointed Ted with the main course mixed vegetable that they served. Attached are all images.
5,Best Indian food by far !! The chicken kebab is awesome and the dal Bukhara just amazing! Breads variety is just delicious
5,Dublin is one of the very unique and different kinda of a pub which is based on the Victorian style of pub. It has extensive selection of the best whisky's and single malts. Also the entire ambience of Dublin is of Green tone. There are several artefacts which are medallions. Also they have additional projector LCD for live matches and any other events.
5,"One of the best restaurants in Mumbai, Dublin, located in ITC Grand Central on Dr. RK Shirodkar Marg, Parel, is a gem in Mumbai's dining scene. Whether you're in the mood for a relaxed dine-in experience or need to grab something to go, this place has you covered.

The menu at Dublin is super versatile. They‚Äôve got everything from cocktails, wine, and spirits to coffee and late-night bites. Whether you‚Äôre looking to enjoy a full meal or just want some small plates to go with your drinks, there‚Äôs something for everyone.

The vibe here is laid-back and calm, which makes it a great spot to hang out with friends or even bring the family. They‚Äôve got highchairs for kids, so it‚Äôs a good option if you‚Äôre out with little ones. The crowd is usually groups just chilling and enjoying themselves.

You do need a reservation to get a table, but they‚Äôre pretty flexible and take bookings on the spot, so it‚Äôs not a big hassle. Payments are easy too... whether you‚Äôre using a credit card, debit card, or Google Pay, they‚Äôve got you covered.

Overall, Dublin is a solid choice if you‚Äôre looking for a place with good vibes, great drinks, and tasty food. Definitely worth a visit if you‚Äôre in the area!"

3,Offering a healthy treat. The store has seating for about 15 persons or so. Convenient with relatively good service.
2,"The food and ambience are nice. But the staffs don't have respect for their customers in true sense. They appear underpayed as they just do their time-bound job. Don't use creative or dedication. They even quarrel amongst themselves. Bottom line is, they must be trained and paid well. All the best."
1,The employee are undertrained and have no knowledge about the product they are selling. Many things were either discountinued or out of stock. The food was very bad in quality. The subs preparation was so bad that a local sanwichwala will make a better sandwich then these guys. Disappointed.
1,"All three subs i had ordered multigrain oney oat bread and they gave me standard bread and also i had told to put cheese my peri peri sub but they didnt and sent the order as it is.

1,"Please don't visit this Hotel, they serve Stale Food

Today, on 17.11.2020 Ordered Mushroom Hundi & Masala Papad from Shobha Only Veg via Order No 17513

This restaurant was once know for Quality Food.

Order delivered is in such a horrible stage, Mushroom gravy was bitter as Mushrooms were totally stale. Too much dried. Not a single piece could be eaten.

Complete waste of time and Money.

After paying such big amounts this kind of food quality is absolutely not acceptable.

Don't regret later, better avoid this spot."

4,"Modern Lunch Home offers a delightful culinary experience with their super tasty Chicken Kolhapuri and amazing Butter Chicken. The Chicken Kolhapuri is packed with flavors and just the right amount of spice, making it a must-try for anyone who loves authentic Indian cuisine. The Butter Chicken is creamy, rich, and absolutely delicious, perfect for those who enjoy a milder yet flavorful dish.

The only downside is the parking situation, which can be a bit stressful, especially during peak hours. However, the quality of the food more than makes up for it. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area!"
3,Food was good. But the place was a little congested especially the AC upper floors. The height of the Ac rooms was not enough for any tall person. Otherwise one can sit and enjoy the food. Prices are a bit high.
4,"One of the best surmai fry one can get is here. The surmai thali is a must have! It costs 410/- in AC room.  The quality of food is very nice.  The fish is crisp and very fresh.

They even serve Chicken sukka, prawns and mutton thali‚Äôs.  This place is decently big and has both AC and Non Ac option.

Its a bit moderately priced place. But i definitely feel that the prices are justified.  I would strongly recommend this place for their fish fry especially surmai and prawns.

The place is located right at Parel TT and one can even simply walk from Parel station also.

I would rate this place 8/10!"
5,"Best place to enjoy the yummiesttt Malvani mutton with Neer Dosa. Ever since I have had this dish at Modern Lunch Home when I was interning at Tata Memorial Hopital, I have been obsessed with this place. It‚Äôs affordable, great quality of food, great service. A must visit if you wanna go into a food-induced come at lunch time. The place can be a little full between 12-1.. but definitely worth it."
3,"I recently dined at Modern Lunch Home and had a wonderful experience. The ambiance is warm and welcoming, making it a great spot for casual dining. The menu offers a fantastic variety of dishes, and I was particularly impressed by their seafood options, which were fresh and flavorful.

Kindly take a note please do not remove this review from the page I want it to be visible to the public."

3,Very old shop in Parel. Good taste of pastries. üòã snacks available too.
3,The wait time is quite high and the good quality is just as bad. Definitely don't order breakfast items here. It was a very bad experience on my first visit here. I'm going to give it an another try and see if there's any change in my opinion. The only good thing about them is that their presentation was good.
4,Four stars because the food is good... The staff though can be more friendly and understanding.. little faster service will also do..Fresh lime soda was the best...
4,Good restaurant for breakfast. We tried missal pav there . It's tasty and at regionable rate
4,On a day when canteen food was uninspiring i ventured into this eatery. I will be honest initially the name made me think twice. But to my pleasant surprise the food was excellent. The place is not tacky or to congested but don't expect classy ambience. But the food smelt and tastes fresh and very tasty. Even the chapati and rice was high quality. Value for money will be understatement as the food was very tasty. Will go again soon

For family visit it is perfect"

My personal favorites here are Idli Misal Pav, Dahi Misal, Vada Pav, Vada Usal & Tea. Jai Hind Restaurant easily accessible from Lower Parel and Curry Road Railway Station. It's hardly 10 minutes walkable distance from this stations. Space is less but quality is really good. Liked it. Foodies go and taste."
5,"For regular lunch goers this is a treat. Morning snacks are also available through out the day. Within 100 you have very good options to fill your belly.

Misal paav is lot loved by localities here.

All dishes above 100 are having quantity enough for 2. Quality of rice is also good. Chinese items are well cooked.

South Indian dishes need little improvement.

All in all a good budget hotel for regular office goers and middle economic class persons."
5,"The taste is too good.... Serving also so quick ...
The misal pav is tooo good.... The price range is also reasonable...."
1,Guys seriously this hotel gives you very cheap level of food paneer crispy is not crispy also it have very thik pieces that tastes very very cheap also all sabjis are tasteless if you want to taste best and tasty food don't come here
3,Food is okey and good but serving is the worst. Had to wait to someone to attend us even on AC room also there‚Äôs no enough seating available in peak hours
1,"This is the most pathethic place i would ever recommend. They are tied up with zomato and accidently I ordered for my mom dad. Firstly they delivered late, secondly tandoori roti was actually like a chappati and attached is picture of Biryani . Who on earth can have this is what I wonder. They did not deliver the other ordered items and later mu parents fell ill . I am highly not recommending it."
1,I was order Paneer Tawa Pulav which was totally taste less. Improve your food taste where you charge high for such food items.
4,"This is good breakfast place in this area.
All south indian dishes you can get here in affordable price. 350 rupees for 2 person with hot beverage.
You can take parcel out from here.
Must try once when you are hungry."
4,"This restaurant been there for last 20+ years. Once the only place for lunch for people working in nearby offices, it now has competition even from local mausis who run homegrown tiffin services. However, it has been able to hold its own. Reasonable prices and consistent in taste, this joint serves all kind of veg food including Udupi version of hakka noodles!!"
5,"This Natural ice cream outlet is located in Parel, Mumbai. It's at a walkable distance from Parel railway station.
They have a variety of options in ice cream. We have tried almost all flavours from this outlet and I have never been disappointed so far.
Will surely recommend it."
2,"It feels like drinking ice cream.. Not frozen. Licking it and eating it is just a waste of money.
Staff did not inform before that it is melted after asking him he inform that.

Worst customer servicsü§í"
4,"I loved the seasonal mango waffle cone. It was lovely and top notch.
I liked how minimalistic they are;
Right from the menu board to the decor.
The hospitality was light and breezy and friendly.
I liked the happie color scheme of the store.
It's pretty fascinating how they make naturals ice-cream as shown by the video at the LED screen.
The temperature is apt.
Perfect treat during the summer times.
Good place to hangout with friends.

Overall, lovely place to chill and eat good quality ice cream."
5,Its Truly Natural. Recently we tried Custard Apple and Lichi flavour and it really tasted good. The flavour and texture of icecream gives you a feel of eating that fruit. Must try.
4,"Natural ice cream ..one of the best in town..

Tender coconut and roasted almonds being my favorite..

You get all the seasons fruits flavours plus dry fruits and chocolates variants."
5,Good breakfast and snacking place. Taste was amazing. Sabudana wada and Misal Pav is a must try. Enjoyed the food. The owner is also welcoming person. Fresh and delicious food.
5,"Visited this place many times. If you're missing home food have the chapati thali. Breakfast options are good. Must try the onion uttapam, misal pav and sabudana vada."
4,"One of my best breakfast joints. They also serve good lunch thalis at reasonable prices.
Best dishes: Idli Wada, Misal Vada, Pola usal. And their coconut chutney is lipsmacking."
3,"Small, routine South Indian Veg. Restaurant."
4,Nice with basic and simple veg food
4,"Fast serving
Apple chicken lollipop üçó üòã
Triple Schwan Rice with combined gravyü§§
The owner was more friendly in talking
The wash basin is too small to wash hands
Should expand their restaurant horizontally or vertically..."
1,"Our team visited to this restaurant to try some vegetarian dishes but unfortunately, I was disappointed with the taste and overall experience. We ordered Spring Rolls, Garlic Fried Rice, Hakka Noodles, and Mushroom Bunchilli. None of them met our expectations. The flavors were bland or just didn't taste right, and we honestly didn‚Äôt enjoy any of the items. Based on our experience, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place for vegetarian food lovers"
1,"I had ordered veg korean rice, via zomato. The food contained a big worm in it. Worst thing to expect while eating food. Please refrain from ordering it."
1,Our team was visited to hotel for lunch and we ordered the lots of dishes  based on google rating and reviews of other customer. We was quite disappointed with the taste and service.
5,"Great place to have Indo- Chinese food! We just loved their Triple Schezwan Chicken Rice. It's different from what you get in other restaurants. The gravy is poured over the rice and served. Succulent chicken pieces present. Loved this. Pricing is a bit expensive, ‚Çπ330/- for this dish, but quality and quantity justifies the price ü§ùüèº (not sponsored)"
2,"#Humare_yaha_aisa_hi_milta_hai.
What you eat outside isn't valid here. Cz here is special type of management
Do not visit and destroy your craving. For timepass must come."
4,Located in very crowded area near lowerparel station west. The rates are reasonable. The quality of food is good. The ambience won't give a privacy kind of environment. If you want privacy you can try the family section. Not that crowded in the evening because lot of road side stalls nearby people tend to go to those maybe because of cheaper rates. Plain dosa was nice but the Cheese toast sandwich is not good because they say u need to tell grilled then only they will grill. Tis is the first time i heard so. Rest is ok. You can try sometime for one go type restaurant.
2,I won‚Äôt suggest you to go here find near by street food instead taste was not that upto this restaurant status cuz it looks clean from outside but inside plate was not that clean and main reason taste of food not that good as you can see the masala dosa was not upto that mark and strawberry milkshake was pathetic grinder was not cleaned before cuz it was mixed with some taste of masala I dint know what was that so don‚Äôt go find instead street food to have much more better than that
5,I have been visiting this restaurant for more than 10 years . For the family of 4 people it is a must visit restaurant. Great food and quality of food would be served. During night time service may affect or on the occasion  service gets affected . Staff is great. Taste of food remains the same
5,"All Foods are  Deliciousness overloaded,Making your taste buds happy,
Food is not just eating energy, it's an experience üòäüòäüòä"
1,"The worst and poorest service was when I ordered jeera rice from Radhe Shyam eatery, which cost ‚Çπ175 and came in a paper box. When the restaurant was contacted about the subpar service, they responded, ""This is normal; we only gave rice in a paper box."""
5,"Best budget friendly veg restaurant near lower parel station, having good ac and non ac seating available serving snacks, north indian, south indian and lip smacking sandwiches at affordable rates"
4,"We went here for lunch a few of my colleagues tried pav bhaji and a few of us had proper lunch ordering kaju masala, paneer handi, roti chapati and dal Khichdi. The food quality is awesome however a lot of improvements required. The pav with pavbhaji were not hot as required."
5,"A simple restaurant with good food, warm service and homely comfortable environment.

Their south India food is really good, of which we enjoyed the idlis, masala dosa & spiced butter milk. Since it was almost end of day, the filter coffee decoction was out of stock and hence we couldn't try the filter coffee.

In addition we also ordered Pav bhaji which was tasty and a veg clear soup, which took some time to come, but was worth the wait considering the freshness of the soup.

The server was courteous to us, comforting to our little one and quick with service.

Overall we were happy with our meal and may visit once again when we are around this area.

Keep up the good work. Cheers!"
4,"Its really nice restaurant for dine in
Good ambience and enough space so not much crowded

Talking about food,its budget friendly and yumm
We once celebrated family function too upstairs
Staff helped us with decoration and other things
Enough space for 30/35 people event

One must try it for sure if you're around lower parel!"
5,"The food was absolutely delicious, and every dish we tried was bursting with flavour. The service was quick, attentive, and friendly, making us feel truly welcomed.
Their best cocktail is Red Rage a must try drinkü§åüèΩüòã"
5,"Canto has a modern stylish vibe. The ambience is pleasant due to the high ceiling, ample seating and outdoor garden area. The food is excellent. We enjoyed the chicken cheese soup, fish tikka, chicken kabab, hummus platter, dimsum, pizza and risotto. We rounded off the lunch with delicious caramel custard and rabri kulfi. The price point of around  Rs 1,500 per person was very reasonable considering the gourmet food and upscale ambience."
5,"Canto is one those restaurants you don't crib about anything, a unique selection of dishes with amazing vibes and good staff, however the only downside was the dessert when the sizzling brownie had arrived the complete end part of the brownie was burnt which does not seem a usual thing, maybe a point to note for the team, however, everything else was fantastic!"
3,"Despite the outdoor ambience, the soace isnt utilized well. The indoor lighting is ordinary. Service could have been better with an interactive server.

Food is good, but portions are very very small. A dimsum had 5 tiny pieces for a whopping 400+ price.

Summary : good place, especially considering it has a nice open to air deck, but considering its underutilisation and small portion size this place isn't overwhelming"
5,"The moment you step into this restaurant, you are immediately transported into a world of culinary excellence. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, with tasteful decor that sets the mood for a relaxing and enjoyable dining experience. The lighting is dim, creating a cozy and intimate ambiance, perfect for a romantic dinner or a night out with friends.

The service is prompt and efficient, with friendly staff members who are attentive to your every need. The servers are knowledgeable about the menu and can make excellent recommendations, ensuring that you get the most out of your dining experience. They are also quick to refill drinks and clear plates, allowing you to focus on enjoying your meal.

Overall, this restaurant is a must-visit for anyone who appreciates great food, timely service, and a fantastic atmosphere. The attention to detail and the passion for food is evident in every aspect of the dining experience, making it a perfect spot for a special occasion or a night out with friends. I highly recommend this restaurant and can't wait to go back again soon."
2,"Was here for an event of Jevlis ka‚Ä¶.
service was poor and draught beers were so much expensive than compared to other big brands Restaurants or bars.
And staffs were kinda rude.
No physical menu available and online menu cards which they are offering, nothing properly mentioned about drinks recipes and all
Will never visit again
Thanks for the hospitality"
3,"They host good gigs, and vibe is also cool, but they aren‚Äôt able to serve food and drinks well, very slow and mismanaged."
4,"Amazing atmosphere, we went there to capture Bboying dance style, it was fun.
Awesome Vibes."
3,"It was an ok place, food and drinks were too high for the ambience and connectivity. The place was well decorated but nothing out of the ordinary

Food portions were not sufficient for a single person for the cost. Wasn't worth the order."
5,One of the most memorable shows I've seen. The Aristocrats are true legends.
5,"This is my regular go to stop for over 2 decades.  They have consistently delivered yummy snacks and lunches. The place is small and can get full for lunch. But it's worth the wait, if you have to"
5,"The hidden gem , for al the non veg lovers who don‚Äôt get good non veg sandwiches , they should head here right Opp the Lower Parel Phoenix.. It has tasty filling sandwiches , it is not a big place it is a small corner but a must visit place for getting good non-veg sandwiches the place also serves veg sandwiches and pizza and cold drinks .. the place doesn‚Äôt has a card machine so carry cash ...
My favourite Sandwich is the American club grill (chicken)"
4,"They prepare yummy sandwiches and they are priced affordable.

The outlet hygiene leaves a lot to be desired.

The service is fast and they deliver all around Lower Parel.

Their best item is Singapuri Bhirji Pav."
5,"Best place of sandwiches in area. Friendly owner, superb variety of sandwiches. Excellent taste and still really lite in wallet.
Place is small, doesn't look too hygiene on first look, but it's clean. Food preparation area for veg and non veg are in different rooms. This place is right on street, right opposite High Street Phoenix Mall entrance. Delivers in nearby area in quick time."
5,One of the best place OPP to High Street Phoenix Mall. Offers good varieties of Sandwiches
5,"It‚Äôs a lovely bar in Lower Parel, Mumbai. We went over here on a weekday, a bit late at night around 10 o‚Äôclock. The place was still so vibrant and alive. The staff were very quick in their services and very friendly and helpful to talk. It‚Äôs a nice place to enjoy some starters and cocktails or beer. The environment of the place is very nice. The layout of the tables is specious enough also the open space in the middle looks unusual for a bar. Sit on the higher level to get the full view of the bar."
4,"Good social space to come for food and drinks for reasonable prices. There‚Äôs a big seating area. We managed to walk in fine around 5 on a Friday but you might want to book if you come during peak hours (late evening and weekends). Staff are all pretty friendly and service is quick, we didn‚Äôt have to wait long for food or drinks. Would recommend to come for a lively atmosphere. Also they do ID you so make sure you bring it."
5,"As soon as you enter Toit (Lower Parel), its humongous space is what will hit you first. This place is Huge, considering it‚Äôs a Pub (Brewpub) in Mumbai. It‚Äôs quite spacious and the ambiance was excellent throughout our stay.

They brew their own Beer and they taste amazing. They even provide Samplers to get you taste some of their new creations- I tasted Stray Apple Cider and liked it. So for my follow up drink, I ordered it. It was quite zesty. My first drink was Nitro Stout which had a chocolatey flavour and was a bit on the heavy side. But still I liked it.

Coming to food, we ordered Stuffed Chicken Wingettes and Half and Half (Non-veg Pizza) and loved them both, especially the Wingettes. Although it had skin on, it wasn‚Äôt a deterrent to its taste. The stuffing was flavourful and the sauce was spicy and invigorating!
The Half and Half Pizza was good too (in fact it was the server‚Äôs suggestion to go for half and half instead of one full, so that we can get taste of 2 house made pizzas!) Spicy Chicken was okayish, whereas the BBQ chicken pizza tasted better.
They do however charge Service Charge - which is a dampner!

Anyways, would love to drop in again!"
5,"Toit was a pleasant surprise, extremely hip playing 90s music and manages a fine balance of past present and future.

Order: Rice Blonde, Toit Larger, Pale Ale, Red Ale, Apple Cider, Mulled Wine, Parotta with beef, Nachos, Goan Sausage Pizza

Drinks: They sell themselves as a brewery so presumably their beers / drafts have to be decent. Larger and Pale Ale lived up to that expectation. The rest of the beers were bad. Surprisingly, they had just one cider which, thankfully was AMAZING, bright and crisp. Mulled wine was good as well.

Food: Everything that we ordered and was AMAZING.

Service: It can be hard to grab Attendants attention and service can be slow.

Pricing: Compared to all the other places that have recently opened this one is less expensive

Seating: Comfortable. Make sure you book in advance.

Restroom : Accessible and Clean

Smoking Area: They have a smoking area with tables and chairs and you can pretty much choose to take your glass along.

Verdict: Although we were not very happy with the beers and service, the overall experience was no less than fun thanks to good food, company, music, vibe and ambience and overshadowed all the negatives. This branch of the original one in Bangalore was worth the hype."
3,"Okay so it was my LAST VISIT‚Ä¶!
Coming to interior it‚Äôs typical Lower Parel interior which is missing nowadays with wooden theme.
The place is usually full out of many times i have visited.
Always visited with my pet.
Thanks to lovely pet friendly restaurant.
However Saturday and Friday eve they are not allowed.
Their cocktails are great bramble and all I have tried if you are going with a non beer person.
Baked nachos is good.
The chicken I guess for wings they use frozen one it has that poultry smell which is annoying.
Taste wise okay.
Their South Indian curry was good.
But biryani was worst i had.
Some flavoured green rice with over done chicken thigs served with birista, I guess it was diy biryani.
Cider
They had apple this time but i don‚Äôt think they should try making such .
They don‚Äôt do it good.
Other places have their ciders in place.
Hefeweizens is good if you like that freshness taste.
Stout is great which is again nitro one which you get only at two places in Mumbai.
I really got bored of beer and food as the menu us limited.
Service is too slow with service charge."
5,"One of the best places to get your hands on drool-worthy donuts. I'm especially fond of their 'salted caramel donut' over the others, which perfectly balances out the salty, but sweetish flavoured topping as the soft donut melts in your mouth. Their coffee and blueberry flavoured donuts are good as well. The MOD store located at the Phoenix mall, though quite small in size, is pretty nicely decorated. The staff is friendly and efficient and you get a warm melted donut pretty fast. Though the store only has a few seats inside, you could literally enjoy your donut anywhere in the mall."
3,"Amazing donut experience. First MOD outlet which has truly spoilt our sweet tooth.

The choice of donuts is amazing here. You also have a live donut making counter so enjoy the story behind your donut as they are made.

There is take away or eat in facility. The staff is good too.

A single thought stayed with us as we exited the shop...Keep the donuts coming!!"
3,Totally loved their donuts. But the pricing is not done properly. I feel the price is too expensive for it. Their double trouble is must try
3,"Donuts are good no doubt but staff needs to be trained on behaviour issue I was clicking pics for review and by mistake I took a pic of the kitchen area (which I deleted immediately) all of a sudden the person got angry on me and started talking to me rudly which I wasn't expecting, I wonder what blunders will happen in future with such staff attitude üëé"
5,I love chocolate donuts from mod. Their chocolate donut preparations are one if my favorite others taste good too.  Best outlet ever for donuts.
5,"If you‚Äôre looking for the best Gujarati & Rajasthani thali in Mumbai, this place is an absolute must-visit! After trying multiple thali spots, I can confidently say this one is my favourite & it delivers on taste, authenticity, and value.
‚úî Authentic flavors‚Äì Every dish, from the dal dhokli to the kachori or basundi , tastes like home-cooked perfection.
‚úî Variety overload
‚úî Budget-friendly
‚úî Great hospitality ‚Äì Warm, welcoming service that makes you feel like royalty.

From the rich, ghee-loaded rotis to the perfectly spiced sabzis and sweets that melt in your mouth, everything about this thali is pure bliss! If you love Indian cuisine, don‚Äôt miss out on this royal feast at an affordable price."
5,"Amazing experience at Maharaja Bhog! The premium veg thali unlimited concept is fantastic. Highlights include the Mangomela and Unlimited Aamras - a mango lover's paradise! The traditional ambience adds to the charm, and the hospitality is very good. Highly recommended!!"
4,"This place in Parel offers An authentic Gujarati thali with a delightful culinary journey, presenting a harmonious blend of sweet, spicy, and tangy flavors. This traditional meal features an array of dishes, including soft rotis or puris, mildly spiced dal, tangy kadhi, a variety of vegetable preparations, and steamed rice or khichdi or lemon rice .
Accompaniments like farsan (savory snacks including khaman, dhokla, kachori), chutneys, pickles, and desserts such as shrikhand or basundi enhance the experience. This establishments  in Mumbai have been praised for serving some of the city's best vegetarian thalis, offering generous portions and a diverse selection that captures the essence of Gujarati cuisine.
The Dal pakwan is sooo good that you would crave for more.
Other must mention things are the warm greetings and serving love along with the food.
Such a good hospitality!"
5,"I was blown away by the experience! The thali was a delightful spread of authentic Rajasthani flavors, with each dish beautifully prepared and bursting with taste. The service was impeccable‚Äîstaff were attentive and friendly, making sure we had everything we needed. I highly recommend Maharaja Bhog for anyone looking to indulge in a delicious thali experience"
5,"A Royal Feast! A Vegetarian Paradise!

Maharaja Bhog in Lower Parel is a true culinary gem! The thali is an absolute feast, with a vast array of delicious and authentic Rajasthani and Gujarati dishes. The flavors are rich and the quality is top-notch. The service is impeccable, with attentive staff ensuring a delightful dining experience. A must-visit for anyone craving a taste of royal Indian cuisine!

As a vegetarian, I'm always on the lookout for restaurants with variety and flavor. Maharaja Bhog exceeds expectations on both fronts!"
4,"Shreenathji‚Äôs is a vegetarian and Jain restaurant that offers a cozy, family-friendly ambiance. Their menu features a wide variety of dishes, including burgers, pizzas, sizzlers, salads, soups, pasta, starters, nachos, avocado bruschetta and fondue.

The Pav Bhaji Fondue was amazing‚Äîserved hot with a creamy, tangy, and perfectly spiced taste that pairs beautifully with its accompaniments. The ‚ÄòChinese water chestnut‚Äô was something completely new yet definitely worth a try. The falafel was also well-prepared served alongside two condiments.

The Shrinathji Special Sizzler was great, offering bold and perfectly cooked flavors. Capsicum rings were nice, but personally, I didn‚Äôt prefer the crispy coating.

The classic sizzling brownie is the perfect way to end your mealü§§"
4,"It is a nice place. I will comment on some specific things.
Starters are awesome. I specially loved their Shrinathji's special Nachos (Must try). Main course which I ordered was not so good. The delivery time is normal. Normally you will find descent crowd there. They have variety of options for dessert. I tried pastry, again an awesome one. The place is a bit congested. The prices are a bit above average. The ambience is good. I liked the photos they have on one of the wall. Overall, a nice place to visit."
5,"I Loved this place.
A pure veg restaurant and bakery located near to Lower Parel railway station West.
- Good quality food.
- Very hygienic
- Staff is very polite

You should try out their Mexican rice and Malaysian rice. It was just delicious.üëå
They have a variety of options in cakes, pastries and dessert as well.

During any celebration at work, we give a call to Srinathji and they deliver the cake that we had ordered.
Very Good serviceüëç"
4,"Great experience, they have recently renovated the place and food is awesome , must try .!!

It‚Äôs a pure veg restaurant .!!

Taste is awesome .!"
2,"Went her for snacks in the evening. We had Punjabi samosa - it was big but very oily and taste was also okay. We also ordered pasta - it was not authentic and taste was below avg, again oily. Pricing is very high. Definitely not worth the money we paid.
Seating - sofas are small for tall people, like if you sit across the table, your knees certainly would crash into each other‚Äôs.
If you want to have oily food, you should go here."
5,"Amazing dining experience. This restaurant gives you all kinds of delicacies including veg dishes, non-veg dishes as well as sea food like fish, crabs, prawns, bombay ducks and squids. I personally loved the surmai and ravas gravy with Goa vade. Yumm Yumm."
5,"Indulging in the rich, aromatic flavors of ghee roast chicken paired perfectly with soft, delicate neer dosa - truly one of the most lip-smacking, unforgettable dishes I‚Äôve ever had!
Every bite bursts with yumminess that keeps me coming back for more. Pure bliss on a plate! üçó‚ú®
Must Visit !!!"
5,"Exceptional customer service.
And the surmai thali was just amazing
Went there for the first time and the waiters there suggested me surmai thali and it was outstanding he also made sure we were provided with everything needed whether it be extra neer dosa or extra gravy."
1,"It was my first time here, horrible experience, they make u wait so that people think this place is crowded, we waited for almost 30 minutes, when we entered there were 2-3 tables vacant so why did they not allow people to get in, they took orders while we wait oustide and still got our thaalis after 20 minutes so thats 40 minutes of waiting for food, fish needs to be prepared can be understood but what about chicken and mutton... That too took same time to appear on the table, after soo much of waiting hot food was expected but our bad again, fish was precooked and just tossed on pan and served bcoz outer layer was warm whereas inside was still not warm, we ordered bhakris instead of chapati, another embarassment, bhakris were also precooked and cold, when i asked the waiter if the bhakri was precooked he shamelessly smiled and said yes and went away, fish thaali was good except the fish not freshly fried, sol curry was outstanding, in my mutton thaali i got two bones and two mutton bones, thats how it works in cheap restaurants, i just felt like i spoiled my lunch and time, restuarants like these should have shame and shut themselves for being so ignorant about their customers, still i recommend only surmail thaali, rest all sucks at this place.
And the last thing i want to mention that this place doesnt have a washroom, so ladies and kids should blacklist this place already. Do not carry vehicles as this place has NO Parking for around 1 km"
5,"It‚Äôs located on the main road and easily accessible. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They serve authentic Konkan cuisine, and their North Indian menu is equally delightful. The prawns koliwada and butter naan were my favorites‚Äîabsolutely extraordinary. I‚Äôve also tried the chicken tikka biryani, basa fry, mutton sagoti thali, neer dosa, paneer tawa fry, and butter chicken. Every dish is worth trying."
1,"Why can't you maintain hygiene at your restaurant!. If you are charging more for your meals then maintain hygiene as well! And educate your chef to maintain hygiene while cooking!! not expecting this from a brand like you!

Edited: Seriously, you're giving me an offer to eat at your place again???. Just read the full review first and understand what this is about exactly!. Focus on hygiene first."
4,"It was long due to visit Charcoal eats dine in as it was always a delivery kitchen. To my surprise, the small cozy little dine in is pretty trendy and it can accommodate 6-7 people.
Coming to the food... It was an absolute feast!

For starters,
I had 4 pieces of Chicken Seekh Kebab. They were moist, flavourful and glazed with butter.
Would have loved to have them charred on the grill and have Nawabi smokey taste

Appetiser was,
BBQ Chicken Pizza Square which blew my mind! The base was made out of Puff Pastry. The combination of Chicken, Cheese, Sauce and the Pastry went really well. But the chicken wasn‚Äôt smokey enough for my palate.

The mains,
Awadhi Chicken Biryani, the Lucknowi delight, I literally finished the last grain of rice. The balance between the Masala and the rice was perfect. The masala did have a spice kick from the Khara Masala and the fried onions. The large portion had 3 succulent pieces of Chicken and is enough for 2 people or one hefty eater. The raita helped cool down the heat from the Biryani.

Finally the dessert,
Salted Caramel Mousse, was a tad bit less on Caramel Taste as the Dark Chocolate overpowered the subtle Caramel. Not to forget it was an amazing dessert and pretty rich.

The whole meal was about ‚Çπ800 and it filled me and my friend. Would I recommend Charcoal eats; it‚Äôs definitely worth a try."

1. Panner makhani meal
2. Panner makhani box
3. Panner tikka curry
4. Dhaba chicken curry
5. Chicken tikka box
6. Moong dal halwa
7. Choco lava
Highly recommended Panner makhani meal and box üíØ"
1,I ordered Shahi Paneer biryani it was just haldi rice and panner it was nothing like biryani no masala in it. Worst experience. No quality and No quantity. Not at all worth 299. I would not recommend box8.
5,"Box8 makes the freshest and fastest meals, and is great for any day you're craving some Indian food. The quantity is never too little, and usually a meal box for one has too much food. My favourite dish is the Dal Makhani! The only reason why this review isn't 5 stars is because I had their chicken biryani once and the chicken was not great. But everything ever since has been brilliant."
4,"Box8 has been one of the successful delivery joint in recent years by maintaining good hygiene and yumm taste with the food they offer. Although they stick to the concept always but they also not hesitant to try out new experiment like the recent one was tandoori paratha. I tried the panner paratha tandoori wrap which has good chunks of panner in indian style spicy gray slong with chatni. From their fusion box, my all time favorite is their overload chicken meal which has 3 types of chicken dal makhni is superb here and a must try and moon dal ka halwa is the best dessert i would prefer which is little more oily though.

Staff across all box8 outlets are indeed very polite to suggest you best of items and helpful in completing your order"
3,"One more time I got a call from Box8 representative to try out their food. This time, they sent me All in One meal Box for free and asked to add a review for BKC outlet.

Veggie Patty Wrap: Roti outside was thick paratha with decent taste. Inside was veg patty with good flavors but nothing great. 3.5/5 on taste.

Chole Tikki Meal with Paratha & Rice: Paratha was hard but the taste was decent. Rice was same as ones in their biryani‚Äôs. Chole was average. Veg balls had a nice flavor but still nothing great. Daal was with rajma and was thick. Flavors were good. Mango juice was the best part. Green chutney along with it was very good. 3/5 on taste.

Paneer Makhni Meal: Paneer was bit on medium hardness side. The gravy was full of tamarind flavor which totally ruined it. Rest all were same as Chole Tikki meal.

Masala Lemonade: Flavors were good but nothing great. 3/5 on taste.

Gulab Jamun: Good. 3.5/5 on taste.

Now coming to the review of Box8 restaurant overall. Instead of doing marketing of food by giving it to reviewers, they should improve the taste of the food. They should know that poeple order food from outside for good flavors and not for looks of it. I am a fan of their pizzas. They are better than those of Dominos. May be they should make other dishes like their pizzas so that good and tasty food will make people write good reviews instead of them asking people to write it."

5,"The best kathi rolls I‚Äôve ever had! I ordered the Chicken Peri Peri roll, and it was mouth-watering. The quantity of chicken was excellent, and it was well-marinated. Overall, I would highly recommend trying their Chicken Peri Peri roll."
4,"I tried their Peri Peri Paneer roll and Aalo Thika roll, both the rolls were delicious and the best part is their paratha which is very fluffy and flaky. I would definitely like to visit again and try their other options."
5,One of my favorites is the Burnt Garlic Mayo. Their rolls are thick and well packed making them super filling and satisfying.
1,What they sell is not a typical roll. It is some kind of wrap which tastes awfulüòñ. After eating the said chicken tikka mayo roll i vomited in a while. Will not recommended this place to anyone. It will ruin your mood and your appetite.Dont waste your hard Earned money on their stuff.0 stars for kk rolls Lower Parel.
4,"Good cakes made here. Also has different options to choose from like pizza breads, pizzas, burgers, pattis, etc. Also have a PHOTO STUDIO but has very slow service (of photos). There are both veg and non veg cakes available here."
3,I tried the chicken burger. The burger isnt dry so thats a plus point but the patty lacks the juiceness. Overall a good burger and good service too
1,Thirdclass Shop.. No Gpay... No exchange
2,service is good but now monginis not making good cake buy at your own risk..
4,Good its costumer friendly and yummy cakes....keep it up
5,"I must tell you this place serves amazing Sushi, I ordered prawn tempura roll and chicken udon noodles and the sushi is any day better than global fusion. The place is small and homely but the food is worth the bucks! I so wish I could try more variety, next time I'll visit with my friends / family only to try more! Thank you Aunty for the amazing hospitality!!"

I really loved the raw taste of meat"
4,"Gastronom is a small cute pan asian cuisine outlet located on Senapati bapat marg .Walking distance from pheonix mill lowerparel.
Interiors are cute.They have about 3 to 4 dine in seating tables and also have many home deliveries  which go through swiggy deliveries.

This place has cute interiors.Small place with  a big heart.Owner Sabyasachi and his mother run the place.Its great to see owners attending their customers personally and taking feedback of the dishes they have served.
Pricing is reasonable for the good quality of food they offer and considering Lowerparel where the rents for restaurants are extremely high.

The dishes are owner's own recipes.Unique style of cooking,serving tasty food which is  highly focused on techniques.Hence they  named this place Gastronom .
They offer chinese,thai and signature japanese dishes.

Coming to the variety of dishes which i tried at Gastronom

Most of the dish preparations at Gastronom are on spicy side.So if someone likes it less spicy please do inform them while placing the order.

Soups
Monchow soup  - A popular soup of Gastronom .Its an indo -chinese soup.Contains mixed veggies (chinese feel)  + is hot/spicy(indian feel)
It was a thick soup and served with crsip noodles.I loved the soup.
Do try it it.

Tom yum soup -  Another signature soup at Gastronom.This was served hot and sour.Thai flavour based soup.Some lemon grass leaves ,lime juice.kaffir lime and was loaded with mushroom and shrimps.I quite loved the flavour of Tom-yum soup
It was spicy,sour ,clear soup and full of aroma!!Worth trying

Starters

Veg crispy - A tasty chinese starter.It was made with refined flour,ginger garlic paste.soy sauce,chilli sauce.The veggies were deep fried.Overall a decent preparation

Paneer kungpao -A delight for paneer lovers.Veg version of chicken kungpao.
A veg sauce was used instead of oyster sauce.Chill sauce was spicy.
Paneer,corn starch ,rice vinegar,red chilly.soy sauce used in preparation of this delicious starter!!

Main course

Veg stroganoff - This is a russian dish.Orginial stroganoff is made from beef and sour cream .Indian version was prepared here by using choc full of veggies.paparika,dill,cremini mushrooms .tomatoes,marjoram,bellpeppers and rice.I personally loved the dish..Satisfying .A dish which even the non -veg should try.They wont miss the beef

Noodles

Pot noodles (veg) - A nice dish to try.I personally love noodles so this was my favourite.Best part being this was not spicy at all.
Flavoured rice cooked in a pot and topped with mushroom ,brocolli and celery.
It was just perfect..

Overall i loved the experience at Gastronom .As the name suggests it does have art of food.A foodie will appreciate the effort behind this set up!!

Definitely worth trying out this place!!

3,"It's a tiny cafe whose potential is greater than it's current state. Fortunately, it's quiet, it has good food and decent atmosphere. They could improve with some of the dishes and improve greatly on the service and hygiene aspect."
5,"The food was incredibly delicious! I ordered some non-vegetarian starters, including my favorite Hong Kong chicken and Singapore chicken. Both dishes were absolutely scrumptious. However, the Singapore chicken was a standout for me. It was my first time trying it, and it surpassed my expectations with its superb taste and perfect blend of flavors."
1,Here service very poor and staff very rude I don't like food and service also here atmosphere very verst. I order paneer handi but  person listen that paneer thali and also argued with me. I am respecting old mens but he is not treat me as a guest
1,Here not get well service also here staff very rude and not listening order carefully also argument with customers I didn't like here service.
5,Very great restaurant with budget friendly menu
4,"Located on Dadar East near the Bridge of Hindamata side. Spacious hotel in crowded area like Dadar  good place to relax and have food after shopping in noisy and crowdy Dadar Market. Good food all varieties available service is quick and prompt. Clean place, cool place for family also. Very close from Dadar East Bus Depot. Vast menu from snacks to main courses."
2,"Food was okay... We ordered some paneer dish, which hardly tasted like panner. Also tava pulao in which there was no salt, when complained regd the same we got a response of add salt from above."
4,"One of the old and iconic restaurants in Mumbai. They serve authentic mughalai food. Food is quiet good and rates are reasonable. They have separate ac and family section also. Ambience is preety good and rustic. Service is fast and staff is polite. We ordered Schezwan tandoori, butter naan, roti, butter chicken. Food were tasty. Overall it was great experience to dine in here."
5,"Gloria‚Äôs Seafood isn‚Äôt just a restaurant‚Äîit‚Äôs a time capsule of delicious memories. As a former Byculla local who frequented this spot 3 times a week years ago, revisiting it felt like coming home. The roasted chicken is still gloriously tender and spiced to perfection, and their Mughlai dishes remain unbeatable comfort fare.

‚ú® Timeless taste ‚Äì Seven years later, every bite is just as I remembered.
‚ú® Hygienic & humble ‚Äì Basic, no-frills ambience but sparkling clean, even when packed to the brim.
‚ú® Heartwarming service ‚Äì They offer free drinking water to anyone in need, a rare, kind gesture in today‚Äôs world.

Yes, it‚Äôs always jam-packed, but the efficient staff and quick turnover mean you‚Äôll never wait too long. The crowd? Proof that good food never goes out of style.

If you‚Äôre craving hearty, flavorful Mughlai classics served with a side of old-school Bombay warmth, Gloria‚Äôs is a must-visit. Here‚Äôs to another decade of crispy rotis, rich gravies, and that legendary chicken!"
5,"Superb taste.
Ambience.
Quality of food was very good.
Chicken was tender and fresh in taste.
Tried sheekh kabaab and Kheema Paratha and biryani.. did not feel too heavy..
Seating arrangement was also good and service is fast..
2 people can have 3-4 items at around 600-700..
Pocket friendly."
5,"This is an old restaurant beside Gloria Church.  They are famous for seekh paratha. Seekh kabab is available in chicken and mutton versions. We tried chicken seekh with paratha,  served with chutney and other accompaniments. It tasted great. Didn't get a chance to try mutton seekh.

We also tried tangdi kabab, chicken biryani and Arabic pudding. Biryani was nothing special, but it was ok. It's better to stick with kabab and paratha.

The restaurant looks chaotic when you enter, but they have air conditioned hall inside.

They deliver upto some distance, they have their own setup for that.  You will not find them in the food delivery apps."
5,"It has seperate Family Ac room. The food is real good in taste as well as extremely pocket friendly. I have tried many of their dishes out here.
Must try :-
1) Butter chicken
2) Seekh (Chicken) not beef
3) Malai tikka
4) Chicken tikka masala boneless
5) Chicken tikka biryani

The Chinese section is also okay to go with but cannot be banked much their soups are great and for starter would suggest Chicken Oyster. Rice aren't that good."
5,Pawan bhai is as sweet as his sweets do visit he is very kind person the sweets I got were fresh and tasty.

5,"Firki -A Delightful Culinary Experience

During our recent visit to Firki restaurant, we were thoroughly impressed by every aspect of our dining experience, including the food, ambience, and attentive service.

**Food:** We opted for the fixed menu, which offered a delectable array of dishes. Starting with the refreshing Pinacolada and flavorful Manchow soup, we moved on to the standout items like perfectly baked Garlic bread, aromatic Chilli paneer, and the scrumptious Hara Bhara kebab. The Firki special paneer was a delightful surprise, complemented by a selection of assorted roti. The Triple Schezwan provided a satisfying and flavorful main course, while the Mud cake concluded our meal on a sweet and indulgent note. Each dish was expertly prepared and left a lasting impression.

**Ambience:** The ambience at Firki is inviting and pleasant. The restaurant's interior is tastefully decorated, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The seating arrangement allows for both intimate dining and larger group gatherings, suitable for various occasions.

**Service:** The staff at Firki deserves special commendation for their exceptional service. They were courteous, prompt, and knowledgeable about the menu offerings. Our server provided excellent recommendations and ensured that we had a seamless dining experience from start to finish.

**Recommendations:** If you visit Firki, be sure to try their Garlic bread and Mud cake, which were definite highlights of our meal.

Overall, Firki restaurant surpassed our expectations with its delicious food, inviting ambience, and attentive service. We highly recommend this establishment for anyone looking to enjoy a memorable dining experience. We look forward to returning to Firki soon!"
5,"I recently visited Riso restaurant based on a Zomato recommendation, and it was an absolute delight for us vegetarians. The diverse menu offering Italian, Mexican, and Indian cuisines impressed us right from the start.

The Lemon Coriander soup and Cream of Mushroom were nothing short of amazing; the latter was delightfully creamy. The Pinacolada and Watermelon Mojito mocktails were superb, especially the must-try Pinacolada.

The starters stole the show, with Paneer Lollipop being an absolute highlight. The special Crostini not only tasted amazing but also wowed us with its presentation.

For the main course, the Paneer Shahslik sizzler was a yum treat for our taste buds. I can't stress enough how amazing the entire dining experience was‚Äîtruly unmissable!

The dessert, Mud Cake, was a superb blast of chocolate sauce on a brownie with ice cream. Every aspect of the meal was a solid 5/5 - service, ambiance, food quality, and quantity. Riso is a gem for vegetarians, and I highly recommend giving it a try!"
5,"Such a lovely place with awesome ambience, positive vibes, delectable cuisine .
A perfect place to unwind yourself, make sure you watch World Cup here as it's a big screen.
3 different menu ,just blown away my mind and I can't believe I could order anything,you want and you get is the feel I have when I visit any restaurant and it was here .
In appetizers we had Special crostini
paneer shawarma roll.
Mocktail - Paan mojito ( Sweet taste lovers) and royal hammer ( üëç Recommended)
Mains
Tex mex sizzler ( Highly recommended)
Julia Robert pizza üçï.
In dessert we had chocolate mud cake with icecream.The cake was so goey and so soft must must try.
I would come again and again."
5,"I have been invited to Riso restaurant in Lower Parel. I must say that the vibe of the place is perfect for all occasions with friends & family. I must say that the food was so yummy & delicious & Classic Swiss Fondue was my favourite, Special Risotto in Pesto sauce was my favourite. I would highly recommend everyone must visit with your friends and family. Thank you so much to Riso for hosting me for the lunch."
4,Chicken quality is ok. Affordable. Good owner.

3,"It's near to station. So, when trains are late, people come here to chill. It look decent from outside and is ok from inside. Near by location is not good. Service is fast. Waiters are good but untrained. Food is good and reasonably priced."
3,This place is okay to have a couple of drinks. Somewhat maintained place.
3,"Not sure if it was a good time that I had. Service is too slow, than the rest... also quite pinching....."
4,A hard drinkers joint. No finesse about it . You get alcohol cheaper than the standard joints so people make a beeline here  Food is good not great  service is quick but lacks polish. Atmosphere is of a hard drinkers joint  can't visit with family. Meant for people who arrive at Panvel late and want a quick bite and a swig.
5,"Serving Best and authentic pav bhaji and tava pula in panvel from last 36 years.
I am a regular customer since i was 15 years now i am 31..."
5,"Kudos to the owner for serving a super delicious Pav Bhaji since more than a couple decades. The outlet is really tiny and cannot be spotted easily from the road, regular customers would never miss this spot. Always crowded, and I would prefer to takeaway because of less seating place. Surprisingly it is very cheap and really tasty."
4,"Pav bhaji is the main attraction of this place. Though the shop is on the road front in the market, it is very remote and hence it becomes difficult sometimes to notice it. The major plus point of this shop is that it always serves freshly cooked pav bhaji. Unlike others who keep their stock ready and just heat it up and serve you garnished. The taste and portion is also very good and sufficient."
4,Pav bhaji is good here. The place is mostly crowdy with the foodies. Take away and dine in both are available. But you have normally to wait here for getting your order ready
5,"Tasty pavbhaji in town...with best quality and quantity according to price! Serving freshly cooked after taking order,serving panvel's people since last 36 years...must try!"
5,"It was a lovely experience
Enjoy the food as well as the staff was polite and sweet
Special thanks to divya
Who treated us with a beautiful smile and served us with grace
Enjoyed the food
And the green chutney is a must try"
5,"Do yourself a favor and visit this lovely restaurant in Panvel. The service is unmatched. The staff truly cares about your experience. The food is absolutely amazing ‚Äì everything we tasted melted in other mouths. Absolutely the best meal we had while . Highly recommend!
Dishes tried:-Lahori Chicken in main course
Starters:-Chicken Crispy"
4,"Malvan Tadka is a paradise for seafood lovers! From the moment you step in, the coastal vibe and warm ambiance transport you to the heart of Malvan. The restaurant's specialty lies in its authentic and flavorful seafood dishes that are an absolute treat to the taste buds.

The menu boasts an impressive variety, and every dish is cooked to perfection with fresh ingredients and traditional spices. The fish thali and prawns curry were standout favorites, bursting with rich, delectable flavors.

The vibe of the place is lively yet relaxing, making it perfect for family dinners or a cozy meal with friends. While the food and atmosphere are excellent, the pricing is on the higher side, which could be a consideration for budget diners. However, the quality and taste make it worth the splurge for a special occasion.

If you're a seafood enthusiast looking for a memorable dining experience, Malvan Tadka is highly recommended!"
5,One of the authentic kokani test with good ambience. Staff is also nice. Will visit next time and suggest to family and friends
5,"This place is known for its seafood as it is evident from its decor. You'll also be greeted with the catches of the day at the entrance itself. The ambience of this place is most suitable for family and colleagues. The service is prompt and the servers are polite and professional. The menu has a good variety and from my multiple visits (both lunch and dinner) I've found that whatever you order, they maintain a quality. I've always had a good experience at this place and hence I highly recommend it to others as well."
1,Chicken are double fried or oil are very bad...which caused food poisoning to our family... every one is vomiting...Never Ever go to this outlet..i m uploading image for the proof
1,Ordering online from Zomato the they are taking to much time delaying order about more than 1hr m very disappointed i will suggest never ever order online from this old panvel branch of KFC delivery guy said they are delaying order everyday not jus once a while  I don't what's the problem with there staff very disappointing
1,"Worst food this guys are just playing with people's health, they literally serving complite expired chicken which is not even chuable..guys pls stay out from this kfc if you really love kfc food visit kfc kharghar"
1,"Shrewd, unhelpful and useless staff. The token screen used for tracking the orders is basically useless. The staff marks all the orders as completed randomly as per their liking and then call out the order numbers when the order is actually ready. When enquired how do we track the orders across the food court, the guy says with a shrewd smile that he'll call out the order when done. Atleast give him a darn loudspeaker so his voice could be heard across the food court. It feels like we are in the markets of Mohen jo daro."
5,"Its finger licking good !!
Really worth a visit.
Went there with friends and all the chicken taste so good.
Service is soo good and also nice ambiance there."
1,"Fire your employee 8f they dont want to do the job
Order 2 subs and received only with patty and lettuce

Rest all thing was ignored by the subway employee, cheese, mint mayo, sweet onion mayo, pickle, capsicum

Will visit the store for giving review"
1,We had ordered for toasted veggie delite and being vegan I only use sweet onion sauce which was used so sparingly. I literally felt I was eating just dough
1,"The WORST Subway I ever had. Mr. Kartik, the manager in Orion mall subway shop gives you wrong bread, when told, he doesn't refund or change bread, also will ask you for things without saying he is charging additional cost for the same, at later will say ""It was common sense"". Such pathetic manager in food chain like subway is not expected. Whenever I feel like eating subway, I order from Kharghar instead nowadays. This guy is very slow, unhygienic, and very pathetic"
1,"The staff are running their own shop under Subway's name and are using ""Buy one Get one"" boards to attract customers just to fool them by serving them an expensive sub without the offer. Staff don't communicate clearly, and forcefully give you the sub that you didn't ask for. There's no option to select your own toppings and they barely add any toppings. After preparing the food they give it to you with an argument saying ""you never said anything about the offer"" and no refund. And if I did not mention it before, the food tastes absolutely horrendous."
1,"Very cheap quality of subs, it's thin and all you can mostly taste is the bread, this is a local issue of Panvel as I've had subs from other places and they're much better."
5,"I visited Barbecue Nation in New Panvel with my family for a birthday celebration, and it was a pleasant experience. They even surprised us with a complimentary cake, which was a nice touch. The starters were flavorful, and the server was attentive throughout, ensuring we were well taken care of. The main course was decent, and the desserts were quite enjoyable. While the variety of dishes could be better, the pricing is reasonable, making it a great value for the experience. Overall, a satisfying spot for family outings and special occasions."
5,"It was all worth it, and Khan made it even better
From start to finish, the experience exceeded expectations. Every moment felt worthwhile, and Khan‚Äôs attention to detail and warm hospitality truly stood out. His service made a great experience even more memorable. Highly recommended"
5,Tasty food beautiful service good peoples help customer a lot. Variety of nonveg and veg food and taste is also good. Different options in dessert. And starters must try pineapple grill. Icecreams and pastry.
3,This food was so good and delicious apart from that  service is too slow I was literally frustrated  and the atmosphere was so cossy you can go with friends and family but you have to wait too long
5,"Food was awesome especially prawns which were really juicy n soft.  Pineapple starters, Basa fish, chicken were all too good. We were served excellently by Sanjoy who kept guiding us throughout. Pastry especially carrot pudding was excellent"
1,"I had a Stromboli yesterday, and it was a disappointing experience. They served the display food, which had been sitting out in the open for an unknown amount of time. When I asked for a freshly made item, the counter staff were so rude that they refused. I then asked to cancel my order since it hadn‚Äôt been cooked yet, but they insisted it was non-refundable. I would not recommend eating here and suggest that a food inspector visit this outlet. The food was not only disappointing but also tasted stale and low quality. The ingredients seemed far from fresh, and the flavors were bland and unappealing. The Stromboli was dry and lacked any of the flavor or warmth you‚Äôd expect from a freshly prepared dish. It‚Äôs clear they‚Äôre serving old, poorly stored food, which is concerning for both taste and safety. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal, as both the food and the service were extremely disappointing."
4,"This is the first time we had anything from Sbarro and we quite liked the flavour.

We had 6"" Chicken Kebab Stromboli and Garden Treat Calzone .

Garden Treat Calzone was mixture of Capsicum , Corn and Mozzarella cheese. Whereas Stromboli was mixture of Chicken Kebab , Jalapeno , onions and Mozzarella cheese.

Flavour was good and worth a try.

Follow @we.eat.everything.delicious on Instagram and Zomato."
4,My third time eating here. Not that many options since its a smaller outlet and they have to keep options as per the demand in the locality. Taste is good but definitely not the best. Staff needs more training as they seemed new to the outlet but that‚Äôs understandable and I wouldn‚Äôt rate them lower due to that reason.
1,"Don't buy from sabarro on Zomato. They sent anything as dull and rotten pizza, quality is very bad. See in picture what they sent.
Also when I call them they are not suppose to help. Customer care is also very unresponsive."
4,"Ordered via swiggy enjoy the pizza the taste was so good and the price just awesome ü•µ

Highly recommended best goto pizza place

* All payment methods accepted"
2,"The once-famous McDonald's establishment seems to have experienced a decline in quality, particularly noticeable in the taste and freshness of their signature burgers. The burgers, which were once a hallmark of consistency, now lack the flavorful profile that patrons came to expect. The degradation in taste suggests a departure from the quality standards that contributed to McDonald's reputation.

Freshness, a key element in fast food, is an area that requires significant improvement. The ingredients don't seem as vibrant or as crisp as they used to be, impacting the overall dining experience. The lack of freshness detracts from the essence of a fast-food meal, and it's a deviation from the standards that customers have grown accustomed to over the years.

Moreover, the current taste of the burgers no longer justifies the price point. Previously, McDonald's was synonymous with affordability and taste, but the recent changes in flavor don't align with the cost. The value proposition seems to have shifted, leaving customers feeling that the quality no longer justifies the expenditure.

In summary, the McDonald's under review has faced a decline in the quality of its burgers, marked by a loss in taste and freshness. These aspects, coupled with a perceived mismatch between taste and price, indicate a departure from the standards that once made this establishment a go-to for fast-food enthusiasts. It may be crucial for the management to address these issues to restore the trust and satisfaction of their customer base."
3,"No AC and cooling...we finally had to take away our order...kids were not even able to sit comfortably. Despite of lot of space, no congestion, still not comfortable due to temperature issue."
1,"Stated that this opens at 8, went there at 8.20, firstly guard of mall didn‚Äôt let me enter as mall was closed, he said use another entrance of mcdonald‚Äôs and as I pursue the whole floor was covered with dirty water to welcome me no one was cleaning there, the seats ware unfolded, waited for few minutes and I left.
Just change the time on the listing to 9AM if you are not able to do the cleaning so your timing will not shit on our plans"
4,"McDonald‚Äôs is already famous for it wide range and affordable menu, it‚Äôs always good deal to buy combo offers as u get good savings. They are allowing dine ins till 9.30pm and take away service after that. Good hygiene is what they follow and clean ambience is always attractive. They also have a self help menu option where u can order n pay urself without reaching the counter, in that way u don‚Äôt have to stand in long queue"
1,"Disappointing Experience at McDonald's, Orion Mall, Panvel

I recently visited McDonald's at Orion Mall, Panvel, and it was honestly one of the worst experiences I‚Äôve had at a McDonald's. The food was disappointing to say the least. The fries were soggy and lukewarm, which made them completely unappetizing. The burger was dry, and the patty lacked any real flavor ‚Äî it felt like they rushed through preparing it.

I ordered a McFlurry, hoping for a sweet treat to finish the meal, but it was a total letdown. It was watery and had very little of the toppings mixed in, making it taste like a bland, melted mess. Not at all what I expected from McDonald's.

To top it off, the service was slow and unfriendly. My order took much longer than anticipated, and when it did arrive, it was lukewarm at best. It seemed like the staff was more focused on getting orders out quickly than making sure they were actually prepared well.

Definitely not the McDonald's experience I‚Äôm used to. I won‚Äôt be returning to this branch any time soon."
2,"The cafe was decent in terms of cleanliness and taste , but my visit was ruined by the constant noise from other guests and despite several complaints, the staff didn‚Äôt seem to have any control over the situation. If you're looking for a peaceful visit suggest look elsewhere. A hotel should prioritise the comfort of all guests‚Äînot just tolerate disruptive ones."
3,The taste is good but the service is horrible and unhygienic
4,Liquid items taste good and taste of pizza is average. I think cafe has some overpriced menu  items which should be reduced. Overall good experience and ambience is good to chill out with friends and family.
4,Nice place to hangout with friends and eat some pizza or have some shakes. The ambience was not that great and the service was also bit slow. We had a French Fries Pizza and it was good. Also we ordered Oreo Shake and it was thick and tasty.
1,"Calling it TERRIBLE is an understatement! Overpriced & bad bad food & service.

No service - we had to stand at the counter for 15mins till we were attended to.

Horrible food -
Chicken Garlic Fingers - these are ready made. Frozen food that is just simply fried. No dips, just a ketchup sachet provided with it.
Cheesy French Fries - Again, frozen McCain fries that were not even thawed, just deep fried. Tasted stale and soft. God knows where the cheese was, it tasted like Mayo spread on the top of them.
White Chocolad - YIKES! DO NOT TRY. Left an oily feel after 1 sip.

Bottom line - NOT RECOMMENDED!"
1,I ordered online. It took an hour for deliverey but while ordering it was told it would take 20 mim.The test was very worse. Don't buy it
1,I buy 1kg Cholocate cake from this outlet but the cake was not fresh at all in first bite only we get to know cake was not fresh.It taste very bad.Cake was stale.Taste like it is baked few weeks ago.This is very disappointing .I will never buy cake from monginis.
5,"Monginis is an exceptional cake shop that offers a wide variety of delicious and high-quality cakes. The shop is always clean and well-maintained, with a welcoming atmosphere that makes it the perfect spot to indulge your sweet tooth. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, always happy to make recommendations or help you find exactly what you're looking for. The cakes themselves are exceptional, with rich and authentic flavors that are sure to please even the most discerning palate. The prices are reasonable and the cakes are available in a range of sizes to suit any occasion, making it a great value for your money. Additionally, the shop offers a range of customization options, allowing you to add a personal touch to your cake. Overall, I highly recommend Monginis to anyone looking for exceptional cakes and service. Five stars!"
1,"Thought that Monginis is a standard brand to make the events special but turned out its not.

First of all they dont customize the cake whatever we are requesting (related to flavor and design) they said NO this can not happen because this is how the company makes it. whatever we have in the display that only you have to buy.

Moreover, they didn't deliver the cake on time. Given time was 9:30am but they delivered at 12 noon. That's really disappointing.

This makes your brand on the very lower side. The address is below with the shop we coordinated.

Shop No 35/36, Raje Commercial Complex, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Chowk, Old Panvel, Panvel, Maharashtra 410206, India"
5,"Awesome experience. Great sevice n help from the owner Aniket. Though I wanted to collect cake early in the morning way before the shop opening time the owner arranged everything and made sure we got the stuff smooth.....
Veryy kind and helpful...."
1,"Worst experience ever. The store staff, who seemed to consider himself the manager, was incredibly rude when I complained about finding hair in both the burger and the coffee. Instead of taking responsibility, he blamed us for the issue and tried to antagonize us. It was completely unprofessional and disappointing"

10th May, 2017
19.00  Hour  ( Indian Standard Time )

SEATING ARRANGEMENT & SERVICE : ( 3 / 5 )
Comfortable seating arrangement. Service is slow and needs to be improved. You can have variety of cakes and pastries along with burgers, Pizzas, Wings, Shakes etc.

PRICING : ( 3 / 5 )
As per the Quantity served, Good for a person ( People having Low to Moderate Appetite)  Might burn a hole in your pocket incase you are opting other than burger.

We started with,

BEAN  BURGER  ( 4.5 /5 )
Burger Patty made from Potatoes, Kidney beans, Onions and spices. Well, as the name suggest; the catchy part was the beans which were abundantly used in the patty. Patty size were decent and thus is Heaven for the veggie lovers.

CHICKEN NUGGETS  ( 3.5 /5 )
The usual chicken nuggets. Nothing mush to offer in terms of taste. Easy to go cheat meal."
1,I recently order ores cake & this is how is was delivered by Zomato. Worst worst experience never buy from here again
4,"Small place but awesome food. I love their hot wings, burger and cakes, they are just awesome. And price is reasonable."
4,"Burgers and cakes really good, also it's cheaper, just that sometimes they don't have enough stock or may be stock runs out and product remain unavailable for customers.
I'm giving it a 4 because of the good pricing. It's pretty reasonable and targeted towards the young crowd who want to have good tasty food in cheap rates. Drinks are OK but not that yummy. The area is small but the cakes, burgers and pastries are big and yummy in low cost. One should check with this option before ordering cake from other stores, it will be yummy n cheaper."
1,"Disappointment means this when u order something and dominos deliver completely different product, this is because they must have aked there vendor to provide paneer and cheese üßÄ extra and they did not get so many orders.. And the product might be expiring hence they had to finish it off..
Really hats of to the stores confident that customers will not compalim and they will eat what they deliver.. Really disapointing..."
2,"The food was not properly baked, and the taste was very bad. The  order delivered was late .
The most important service is not good."
1,"One of the worst experience we had in this outlet.
Outlet is not clean properly.
AC is not working , water leakage from AC. No one at the counter to take order.
No topincs serve while reciveing order.
Food quality is worst.
There is no fresh pizza it's leads me to vommitting.
They are playing with our life and faith.
Please Domino's we love you but this outlet need to be improved."
1,We ordered corn cheese for take away but turned out there was no corn. This is second time I am getting wrong item. Last time also we ordered cheese burst but it came without cheese burst..
1,"Tasteless cold pizza üçï.  I ordered volcano peppy paneer pizaa, classic pizza, veg paneer parcel. 50+min for delivered food. All the food gets cold.
Domino's was like this before and it is like this now. Tasteless unhealthy too."
1,It's very poor and expensive  thay charge 180/- ruppis for half tandoori and not give onion and green chutney. I'll go there according Google review but people are giving fake reviews completely disappointed with their service and their charges.
5,I love to eat meals in food land. They give chinese item very clean and tasty.
4,A different take on Indo Chinese food.. Pretty good quantity.
5,Try tandoor chilly and crispy the best from here....value for money
5,"I love it very IT IS VERY  beautiful  hotel it is famous hotel in world FOOD LAND IS FAMOUS FOR IT'S VERY VERY SPECIAL
FOR ITS  (CHICKEN  TANDOORI )
‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫ I LIKED IT"
5,Peaceful place to spend some quality time with your loved ones.. polite staff and tasty food. I‚Äôll highly recommend you to try crab lollipops! They are tasty!! Also the prawns biryani and verity of dishes..
4,I have been here a few times and overall it was a good experience. Loved the chicken lapeta and the other stuff we ordered. Prices are moderate. Service is good but recently due to less staff it was very slow. Will recommend to visit atleast once.
1,3 class service bad taste never visit this trash place rude workers and bad taste of food
5,After the peace park I think it's another place where u can get taste .I enjoyed the food
5,Awesome place and food... must visit to enjoy food and services.
1,totally worst experience with pizza hut new panvel outlet. we have ordered two veg pizzas and totally it was waste of money as it was having very less toppings and only bread was there in pizza. Also not cooked properly and capsicum size also too big. Quality not good.
4,"I recently visited Pizza Hut in New Panvel. The ambience was great, but the pizza lacked in taste due to less sauce and fewer toppings. While it was decent, it left me hoping for improvements in the future. For now, I‚Äôd prefer Domino‚Äôs for better flavor and toppings."
1,"Recently I had ordered a pizza combo and french fries,
In which onion corn pizza was totally burned and french fries were very bad in taste and full of smell
Bad service"
2,"Pizza Hut at New Panvel is degrading day by day, with inadequate staff, more waiting time and a pathetic environment. I tried their newly launched Melts pizza and it didn't meet any expectations. The Jalape√±o poppers were okay. The AC wasn't even working where I sat. Either this outlet should be shut down, or be replaced with more skilled staffs."
1,"I have been a loyal Pizza Hut customer, but today's experience was nothing short of disappointing. For the first time, I ordered through Magicpin due to a great offer, only to witness Pizza Hut‚Äôs reckless and unprofessional behavior. They deliberately delayed the order, openly telling the delivery person that they would take their time simply because it was placed through Magicpin. This level of disregard for customers is unacceptable.If this is the new standard, they are bound to lose more customers."
4,"I visited Om Sai Fast Food Centre for the first time, and it‚Äôs a very casual place with open seating. It can get quite crowded, which adds to the hustle-bustle atmosphere. I decided to try their Chicken Thousand Rice, and I must say, it was great! The taste was fantastic, and the quantity was generous, especially considering how reasonable the prices are.

However, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not the place for people who prefer comfortable seating and a great ambiance, as the atmosphere is quite basic and laid-back. This is likely why the place has a low rating ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt focus much on the overall dining experience but rather on quick, affordable food.

Despite the casual setup, I really enjoyed the food and might visit again for a quick bite. Overall, if you‚Äôre looking for a budget-friendly place to eat without worrying too much about comfort, Om Sai Fast Food Centre is worth considering."
1,Very bad quality of food they provide with high rate if u not believe please order o e chicken lollipop and see result such a bad quality food they provide
1,Very 3rd class quality food is available here if u don‚Äôt believe please order chicken lollipop and then see  food quality is very bad and rate is also too high‚Ä¶

5,Shop is very neat and clean .many varieties are also available in this shop .sales person is also very polite
5,Cake was really nice. Design of cake was made very perfectly as instructed. Dutch Chocolate taste was superb. All adults and children enjoyed it a lot.
1,Before 2-3 years this bakery was the most famous and lovely... but now the tast of its products have become pathetic... i will suggest you not to buy cakes and stuffs from here... although breads are fresh... but rest product!!!!!!!!!!!
5,"It's a lovely place
Smell great
Service is best and fast
Cakes r best tasty üòç"
1,"Very bad experience. I had placed an order online a day before for one of my relative's occasion and next day I called them up to ask if cake will be delivered on time. They assured me that the cake is on its way. After the time slot the cake was still not delivered. They didn't have the decency to inform me that cake was dispatched late and lied to me. Very unprofessional behavior, not at all expected from a brand like yours. People please think twice before you place order from this store."
5,U must try and ask suggestions from Chef too.. the real taste of food in every bite.
5,"Best bakery in the town if someone is looking for Cakes. Quality of the cakes are excellent and have reasonable pricing. Savouries, pastries and other packaged items like bread, chocolates are available here. Staff behavior is very good."
4,"A place which serves very delicious food items and has a very positive vibe spreading environment. One should definitely visit non-veg delicacies. The great service it has and the staff were too disciplined and friendly. Thank you very much for this wonderful service.

Food ordered :
üî∏ Chicken tandoori
üî∏ Chicken lollypop
üî∏ Chicken tikka masala
üîπPaneer tikka masala
I would also recommend, üî∏ Chicken tikka biryaniüî∏ Chicken matka biryani and üîπPaneer tikka biryani
I will rate this place 5/5 on the quality and quantity of food."
5,This restaurant really has a good vibe. They also started a cloud kitchen called Rumali house which has very nice and tasty food combos at an affordable price.  I really love the taste and ambience of this restaurant.
5,"Quality food, quality ambience, not too crowded therefore feels bit relaxing after an hectic day, taste is really good and spice blend is excellent, service provided is also good and it is an family friendly resturant therefore it feels like an excellent package of everything."
5,"Good food.
Reasonable rate
Well maintained
Nice ambience
Good to visit with family"
1,"Writing this after experiencing this fourth time. I recently ordered from Kiba Restaurant and was extremely disappointed with the delivery service. Not only was the food late, but several items were missing from my order. I had ordered a few tandoori dishes, which are supposed to come with sides like mint chutney, onions, lemons, and salads‚Äîbut none of these were included. The whole experience felt incomplete without these essential accompaniments. Even my order was incomplete, they did not note order properly.

To make matters worse, when I tried to call and resolve the issue, the response was less than helpful. I expected much better from a restaurant with Kiba's reputation. Sadly, I won‚Äôt be ordering from here again anytime soon."
5,"I visited the Domino's outlet in New Panvel and also ordered delivery from them, so here are both reviews. The taste was as great as always, with generous toppings. The delivery was impressively fast, arriving within 15-17 minutes.

As for the outlet, while the food and service were good, the tables were often not cleaned, and empty order boxes were left around. I hope they pay more attention to cleanliness in the future. Overall, it's still a great place for pizza!"
1,"I had visited this place with my husband a couple of days back and this is the experience that I had.
The slogans should actually be ‚ÄúTOTAL BAD SERVICE GUARANTEED ‚Äú and ‚Äú LEAVE NOTHING BEHIND BUT COMPLAINTS ‚Äú. Especially a female employee named RUTUJA. I had a horrible experience with this specific lady not once not twice but three times. Worst employee any employer could ever have. I had to wait for more than 10 minutes to just place the order. And the reason behind this is RUTUJA.  And just look at the atmosphere and furniture and servings kept at the outlet."
1,"I visited Domino's on 30/11/24 at new panvel branch

God knows why people eat it..... Service is soo bad that after giving order once the waiter will disappear for 1 hour..... I visited this place for the first time and travelled all the way from mumbai to panvel to try this lapeta.... After eating this dish i got to know why people call this dish lapeta because these hotel scammer lapet people by giving them hopeless food.....mutton lapeta was soo hard soo hard that forget chewing the flesh u cannot even tear the flesh with your teeth..... Please carry a hand saw or axe to cut the pieces..... 25 minutes after giving the order the waiter realised that they do not have bhakris whereas we were the 3rd or 4th customer to dine for the dinner..... families besides us were complaining of late and cold food served...... Plus there was power cut every 5 minutes..... We literally ate and wrapped up our dinner asap..... Such an horrible experience  it was..... I regret wasting time and money visiting this place just on the basis of instagram video..... The waiters are soo dull and non responsive..... Pathetic pathetic place.

From the rich flavors of North Indian cuisine like their creamy paneer dishes and the ever-popular chole bhature and puri bhaji to the crispy South Indian dosas, every dish is a treat to the senses. The paneer items, in particular, are perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor, while the dosa varieties come with authentic sambhar and chutneys that are simply irresistible.

‚≠ê Overall Rating: 4/5
‚úÖ Highly Recommended for all devotees and food enthusiasts visiting Siddhivinayak Temple."
4,"The place is good and fully air conditioned. Expect a lot of rush as lot of the people who visit Siddhivinayak Temple come here. The food is really good, service is a bit slow. Loved the Ukdiche modak and would definitely visit again. The Chaas served here is thick and tasty as well."
5,"Why visit:

1) This is within the siddhi vinayak temple premises.So, after early morning Puja,you can have breakfast here.The eatery opens around 7.30 am

2)Nice fresh food especially south indian food

3) Clean ambience

Must try:
1) puran poli
2) ukadi modak
3) vada idli sambhar"
4,"Our go to place when visiting the Siddhivinayak temple. We are usually here quite early (0800 am) but the place is quite crowded even then. The food is good - not the best. They offer a wide range of snacks, sweets and meals. We love their steamed modak."
2,"Disappointing experience at Shri Siddhivinayak Refreshment. We ordered Kothimbir wadi, Friend idali, Methi masala and roti. Kothimbir Wadi had no coriander leaves and disappointingly made with only besan. Fried Idali was puffy also sambar and coconut chutney was tasteless. Only Methi Masala was delicious.

Recommendation: Improve authenticity and quality of dishes, especially Kothimbir Wadi."
5,"Best meal I ever had in a while while traveling to mumbai
Really the taste was fantastic and hit every tastebuds and what's even better is their price
Very reasonable and affordable price üôÉ

I would recommend trying their fried prawns it was so good I regret not taking one for takeout üòîüòî

I would definitely recommend you to have Chinese food here this is really the best"

Only beer is served no other drinks"
4,"We crash at this place quite regularly for Beer and non-vegetarian food. It's no frills, to the point place to hang out with friends. Good food and overall less expensive to other places around."
4,A regular men's bar and lunch home. Very reasonably priced. Food is good for the price and service is prompt. Their mini veg lunch is filling and costs just 70 rupees. Non vegetarian food and seafood is also good. Not very far from mahindra towers.
3,A regular quarter joint but has a family section too. Worth a visit for a quick drink
4,The exterior vibe of the place takes you to Greece. One section takes you to a place full of frames. Over all a good experience when the food was considered. Especially the red chutney served with the tandoor items and the thecha served with bombil fry. Worth the visit.
5,"""Chetan Bar & Kitchen""
This 23 y.o.restro-bar in Dadar is a must visit if you love good food and decent ambience. 2 mins away from Dadar station, Chetan Bar and Kitchen has got 3 gorgeous & premium dining sections, each with different decor being perfect for all your gatherings.
They serve supervisor tasty veg options but seafood like Surmai and Bombil fry, pleased our tastebuds besides our all time fav kebabs.
Bar drinks added booze to our meal.
From the southern style main course, we loved Chicken Chettinad & prawns malipuram. Singaporean noodles can't be missed too.
So what are you waiting for ?? Head to this outlet and make your weekends foooddelicious.
Cheers !!"

It is full of oil in it. I never recommend this restaurant to any body. pathetic"
4,A regular mostly mens only bar. However they have separate seating for families. Good place to hangout with friends over few drinks. Food and alcohol is reasonably priced. Just a stone throw distance from Dadar railway station on east side. I usually come here for a quick drink and food when taking long distance train from Dadar Railway Station. Service is quick and location is just couple of minutes from Dadar station east. The menu is super big with many items and chef's special. They don't serve cocktails üòï.

5,"Best lassi in Dadar!
Creamy, perfectly sweet, and consistently delicious. The mango lassi (in season) is heavenly. A must-visit for traditional lassi lovers. Friendly service + clean straight forward setup"
1,"I recently visited Kailash Lassi Center in Dadar and honestly, it was a disappointing experience. They charged ‚Çπ35 for a half glass of lassi, and there was absolutely nothing special about it. The taste was average‚Äîno better than what you get at any regular roadside stall. With so many years in business, one would expect them to offer something truly unique or at least memorable, but sadly, they rely only on their legacy. Just being ""old"" is not a uniqueness if your product doesn‚Äôt live up to the hype. At that price point, you expect quality, flavor, or a standout experience, but it was just a plain lassi with no richness or thickness to justify the cost. They‚Äôve clearly taken customer loyalty for granted and stopped innovating. There‚Äôs a gap between their reputation and what they‚Äôre currently serving. If you‚Äôre going to charge premium prices, you better serve premium quality‚Äîbut Kailash Lassi fails to do that. There needs to be a balance between heritage and value for money, which is clearly missing here. It‚Äôs high time they either upgrade their offering or lower their prices. Otherwise, it‚Äôs just nostalgia keeping the place alive, not the quality of the lassi."
4,"Best lassi in Dadar Mumbai This is one of the oldest places in Mumbai
Creamy, perfectly lassi good one"
4,"Closer to the dadar railway station.

They are famous for their Lassi. You will get various snack options like Vada Pav, samosa Pav, dahi samosa, and many more.

You can visit whenever you are in dadar."

4,Great place if you take away.Dine in facility also best as the food is tasty and served within minutes.The place can improve by increasing seats and installing AC.
5,Tastiest food and the owner has some incredible magic tricks up his sleeve. Central Mumbai‚Äòs best kept secret and a must visit on your next foodie trip to Mumbai.
5,"VAGAL name, very good malwani fish dishes.
I always order home delivery.
I am happy for prompt services provided.
You must order try."
5,"I tried the ukdiche modal for the first time, and it tasted quite good. The missle pav was also served very quickly. I have tested the tea, and it was excellent! üíØ

And service is really great"
5,"One of the best places to eat Maharashtraian food in Mumbai. It's just outside the Siddhivinayak Temple and the staff is an absolute delight.

We tried Butter Masala Dosa, Mysore Masala Dosa and Mumbai Pav Bhaji. All 3 were 10 on 10, I would highly recommend. I'm writing this review as I walk away after paying and I just wanna go back once more for their Ukadiche Modak.

About the beverages, I wouldn't recommend their Lassi and Chaas, but that's okay, they aren't known for their Punjabi food anyway. I would, however recommend their Kokam sharbat. It was awesome.

We have been in Mumbai 3 days and I was ready to go back to Delhi with an awful experience (food-wise), especially after the Leopold Cafe and Donna Deli (both are shit by the way). MODAKAM changed my mind. Off to Dadar Beach now!"
5,"Great place for maharashtrian snacks, tried kothambirwadi and wada usal taste was very good, also their modak are delicious"
5,"This is one of the best places in Mumbai which serves Delicious Maharashtrian food. Their Ukdiche Modak, Kothimbir wadi, Aluchi wadi, Chakli, Bhajniche thalipith and Upwas  misal are the bestsellers and a must try.
Go there as a group as you can try a lot of dishes here. We also tried their Dosa n Pavbhaji and  they were also good.
It's situated right next to the Siddhivinayak temple. So you can have food afterwards.
Absolutely recommended"
4,Great quality food and nice food quality good Maharashtrian food fast service. Must try food here great experience
3,"Decent place for food. Decent good burgers, Chinese. Economical!"
5,"This place makes excellent food, both indian and chinese. Its more of a delivery or take away place as the restaurant inside has pretty limited space for eating. But the food is awesome. I live next door and whenever I am hungry for some good non veg food, I just order from here."
4,Pocket friendly and tasty food. Chefs are from Kolkata and Nepal.
5,Went to this joint after very long time chicken BBQ pizza Is finger leaking good. Love to have pizza from so many years. Affordable restaurant. Best place. Have been here so many times.
1,Chinese food has gone down the drain here. Been eating here since the time it started.  Worst veg hakka noodles and veg balls uncooked inside. Zero taste. Please eat the Indian food menu  here.
1,"absolute trash
when we entered the dustbin was kept open with smell and flies all over. we sat down and the tables weren‚Äôt clean. we proceeded to order the new combo of cookie + cappuccino and it was absolutely trash. The coffee tasted like warmed up battery acid and they didnt even warm up the cookies which they gave, after asking them to warm it up it was only 50% warmed up and only the sides of the cookie was soft and the middle was rock hard Soon to realise that it was a stale cookie. Didnt expect this from subway, worst experience ever

tldr: dont go, its honestly very bad. bad coffee and cold stale cookie"
5,"I ordered from Subway Prabhadevi on a hectic Monday morning, expecting just a regular meal, but what I received was so much more! Along with a perfectly made sub, I found a handwritten note from the staff‚Äîfull of warmth and kindness. In the middle of a busy day, this small yet thoughtful gesture truly made a difference.

The food was fresh, delicious and made with care, but the service? Absolutely outstanding! It‚Äôs rare to come across such genuine hospitality and I truly appreciate the effort they put into making a customer‚Äôs day better.

Highly recommend this outlet for not just great food, but also for the wonderful people who make it special! üíõ"
1,"Horrible Subway, I‚Äôve ever seen. Ordered from Swiggy,

I called for a Aloo patty 6 inch Subway sandwich and a veg delight, 12 inch Subway sandwich.

Unfortunately, I did not get the Aloo in the sandwich itself. What is the point of ordering for Aloo patty if there is no aloo.

Also my veggie delight was missing the cheese slice and mozzarella chess which I had paid for as an add on."
5,Alim and abhishek very good making a sandwich ü•™ awesome test ü§§ lovely behaviour üëçüòä
5,The sub was great and the small quote made my day Thank you
4,"Loved the chhole kulche there. We had potato onion kulche melted in butter. Chhole tasted amazinggg and achar (pickle) they offered was also like home made achar. They also offered onion chutney along....that was also good. In total, it is a must go place for authentic amritsari food in mumbai at a very reasonable price.
Only issue is the eating space...which is congested. But, I can again go there for their food despite lesser space."
5,Its a small sit out place for kulcha lovers with other variety in the menu included. The staff is very cooperative and the owners are also very humble and responsive on call inquiries. The taste is very nice . Hence value for money !
4,"Food - 4‚ú®
Sitting Area - 3.5‚ú®(quite small place but wouldn't be a big problem as there is outside sitting available too.
Staff - 4‚ú®
Price - Slightly on the expensive side

Went here on a Sat evening around 6pm, it wasn't very crowded as it opens around again after a break around this time.

We tried their famous paneer cheese kulcha, it was really soft and was served with a tasty chole. It lived up to its hype.

We also tried their malai chaap, it was good and had a balanced taste, and I tried chaap for the first time.

The owner is helpful and understanding and accommodating."
4,Food was great. Specially dahi papdi chat and dahi bhalla chat was so tasty. Lassi was also good. Found a little bit congested space wise. Get to sit after some while. Otherwise food and service wise good place to visit light brunch.
3,"Place was good for a quick snack bite,bits near the temple so easy to visit and done.
We had ordered potato veggies which were not upto the mark. But we also ordered Pavbhaji which was awesome as I had that taste after a loooog time..üòã"
1,The chicken pan pizza is good here quite expensive. The pastry purchased was very dry and charged different price than displayed on them. They don't have microwave. It is quite expensive as compared to quality and taste
1,this is a fake shop and i reached at 9:30 but the cake shop was still closed and the number is not real. please do not waste your time in coming here because this is a fake shop.
3,"Cake = Monginis..
Fresh cake, pastries.
All your birthday cakes used to come from your local joint. This place brings back some wonderful childhood memories. Since then, the quality of the cakes has drastically reduced. Business might be dying out because of lack of invention or creativity."
1,"I ate paneer roll from this shop. Next day my stomach got upset. Acidity and loose stools. As a doctor I won't recommend this shop to buy anything which is not cooled like rolls, puff, samosa etc. Don't know about cakes or cold stuffs here."
1,"1. Home delivery is not available
2. Cake is not at all soft, very hard
3. Felt cake is not fresh
4. Charging money for small things- candle n all"
5,"*Food* : We are a family of seafood lover, and this place exceeded our expectations. We ordered the Tirslya bhujane, Rawas thali, Prawn thail, Veg thali every single dish was absolutely amazing even the Veg thali was delicious which came with a modak served hot with shahjuk tup. The Modak blew our minds and had to order another.The fish was fresh, and the slices of fried fish were huge.

Service : Have to mention the unmatched hospitality and service, we called them for directions and with helping us with the place and other details, they even WhatsApp-ed us the location and address.

Value for money : 10/10

Special mention Rahul Patil for the service."
5,"I celebrated my birthday at this restaurant with my mom and dad, and it was a wonderful experience. The food was delicious, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming, and the staff made us feel truly special. It was the perfect place to create beautiful memories with my family. Highly recommended!"
4,"After visiting Siddhivinayak Mandir, we were really hungry and wanted to try some authentic Malvani food.
That‚Äôs when we decided to head over to Chaitanya.

There was a long wait outside since it was peak late lunch time, but we patiently waited and finally got a table.

We ordered a simple Malvani prawn curry, bhakri, and ukdiche modak (steamed modak).
The solkadi was also very authentic and refreshing.

The food quality was excellent, truly living up to all the positive reviews we had heard about this place.

A must-try spot if you are in Mumbai and craving authentic Malvani flavors!"
4,"This restaurant‚Äôs Must try dish is stuff paplet.
Which is stuffed with amazing green paste.
Overall good experience.
Base Gravy is almost same for all the dishes
Prawns were fried perfectly.
Everything was fresh except tisrya (clamps)"
5,"Authentic Taste Of Malvani Food!!!üòçüòãüòã
Must Try Fish Thalis also starters.
My Fav was Surmai Fry and Solkadhiüòã
All Fish Thalis are subjective to size fish.
Chaitanya has maintained its taste from years.
Rates are premium but worth paying."
4,"Nice place
Small and clean
Must have Maratha Misal and Tea there in just (Rs.75/-)
Price is very pocket friendly
And taste is also nice
Must go
If you are around wadala west or near dadar east
Its just beside Ram mandir wadala"
5,"Very good restaurant in Pratiksha Nagar,it's serves with tasty veg as well as non veg ,, special dishes,,Home delivery,,Ice cream parlor,,very good table service,,overall Lazavab!!!"
3,Takes too much time to deliver order. And also to serve food every time
3,Ok place.. Tasty food
4,"GOOD FOOD , VALUE FOR MONEY !"
5,"I‚Äôm back with another incredible dining experience, and this time it‚Äôs at Fiesta Bites in Dadar. This was our second visit, and it definitely lived up to the hype once again. The food? Absolutely divine! I couldn‚Äôt stop raving about it. Every bite was a flavor-packed delight. The ambiance is equally charming‚Äîperfect for a relaxed evening. If you‚Äôre planning a visit, I highly recommend stopping by on a Saturday night, as they offer live music that adds an extra touch to the vibe.

Here‚Äôs what we tried:

1. **Sichuan Cheese Corn Balls** (5/5) ‚Äì These were nothing short of perfect. Crispy on the outside, creamy and cheesy on the inside, with just the right amount of spice. A must-try!

2. **Sichuan Noodles** (5/5) ‚Äì Packed with bold flavors and a perfect balance of heat and savory goodness. This dish was a real winner!

I can't recommend this place enough for its amazing food, great atmosphere, and vibrant energy. Definitely worth the visit!"
4,"This restaurant is suitable for couples as well as for Family & friends. Food quality and quantity is really good here. You get live music on weekends at this place. This restaurant is 10-15 minutes walking from Dadar railway station (w).
People preferring jain food options should definitely visit this place. In terms of service they are bit slow but never mind. It's a small place so I'll recommend you guys to have a prior booking specially on weekends."
5,"I'd recently visited Fiesta Bites on a weekend for family dinner. The place is well lit with yellow lights and sets an overall good vibe with their sweet staff and Live Music.

This place has Live Music on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

The general timings are from 5 pm to 3am. However, they are open for lunch on Sundays and it a nice place for Kitty Party.

This place serves fast food. It is a Pure Veg restaurant and has the option Jain food too.

Do try their Fantasy Pizza, Mac & Cheese Pasta, Cheese Pav Bhaji, Brownie Milkshake, Ferrero Rocher, Strawberry Fresher, Orange Crush, Green Apple Fresher, Peri Peri Fries, Paneer Chilli Dry, Tiramisu, Pesto Cottage Bruschetta and Loaded Nachos."
3,"Fiesta Bites is that nearby place that's perfect for taking care of those midnight munchies.

Although they do have seating, Fiesta Bites isn't bad when it comes to food delivery. Delivery does take a little more time even if you are nearby, possibly because food prep takes a while.

Each individual product was well packed. There were no leaks, even when it came to a watery salsa. That's a plus.

The Onion Rings were the first thing we ordered. This is a delightful appetizer and I highly recommend it. Even though it was delivered, it still remained crispy. The rings were well seasoned. Although you do get a kind of chipotle/jalape√±o mayo dip with this, I don't think it's needed; they taste great without any dipping.

Another starter we ordered was the nachos. You do get nacho cheese and salsa along with this order. The quantity of cheese was less for the amount of nachos. The nachos were well seasoned which could be why the nacho cheese didn't have much seasoning. I wasn't a fan of the nacho cheese; it was clumpy even after heating it a bit. I was very disappointed with the salsa. Rather than having something fresh, the salsa we got tasted like watered down, highly sweet, and seasoned tomato ketchup. Overall this dish was just okay.

For the main dish, we went for some traditional Margherita pizza. The toppings were good. The pizza base could have been baked for some more time; it tasted a little bit on the bready side. The tomato sauce used was well seasoned but, again, there was something not so fresh about it.

I do appreciate that Fiesta Bites is open late into the night. It is a decent choice for those late night hunger pangs."
1,Pizza had burnt pieces and they refused to accept it was burnt. Pasta was average. Paneer roll was ok. Overall we didn't have a good experience at this restaurant.
5,"Ordered from here yesterday evening because we were very hungry for some good pizzas! Decided to go for :

‚Ä¢ Hot N Spicy Chicken Pizza (4/5): Ordered this in 8inch. Was really spicy and delicious! Decent amount of chicken on it. Salami, sausage, etc. A good one for my first try out here!

‚Ä¢ Butter Chicken Pizza (4/5): I'm a super fan of Butter Chicken, hence I went for this one. Could've been better though. The taste was genuinely good, no doubt!

‚Ä¢ Garlic Breadsticks (3/5): Wanted to try their garlic bread as well. Went for the 2 pc one. Was alright.

We also took Lipton Iced Teas as a beverage.

Overall it was a good first time experience here! I am definitely trying other pizzas of theirs soon!ü§§"

They have different options available in veg as well as nonveg and you will like every option available.
I ordered 2 nonveg pizzas and a muffin and also pickup some ice tea.

I orederd one Chicken mexicana pizza and one Hot-n-Spicy Chicken Pizza.
Chicken mexican pizza was great and you should try it sometime. It was good in taste and toppings very also in good quantity.
It was a Mexcian style pizza so it was spicy.
Hot-n-Spicy Chicken Pizza as the name says it was spicy and if you love spicy pizza's then you will definitely enjoy this one.
It was good pizza to try as well. Ice tea was a good option to have while eating the pizzas.
Muffin was made of choco chunks. It was chocolate muffin and it was great to have after two spicy pizzas."
5,"SBARRO Worli we were here today for a pick up. They have amazing varieties from the premieum to the regular range here‚Äôs what we tried

1. Makhani paneer pizza ‚Äî‚Äî Chunks of onion in makhani sauce, onions , capsicum and cheese. Freshly baked.

2. Veggie delight ‚Äî- All veggies capsicum, onions & jalape√±os tossed & served in pizza sauce .

3. Garlic bread ‚Äî- 2 portions of garlic breads loaded with extra cheese. Awesome to taste.
These were served with iced teas . Easy on pockets . MUST TRY."
4,"On a lazy Sunday evening, we decided to order food at home rather than stepping out. Box8 was a name heard and seen many times but never tried, so we gave it a shot, wanting to have something new. The order placement and delivery was a breeze, the food arriving well in time. We started off with the wraps, Mayo Tikki and Veggie Patty Wrap. Both were good, but I liked the latter more, being spicier and the mix of various veggies making it even more tastier. The paratha used for the wraps was lovely, though felt just a tad dry. Up next was the Bombay Special Sandwich, looking very much like a Subway, but far easier on the taste buds. From the multigrain bread to the veg tikki, everything about it was just spot on. I highly recommend this one. Finally, we opened the box containing Shahi Paneer Biryani. Made with basmati rice, grilled paneer tikkas as well as mushrooms, it was a total letdown, being quite tasteless, no spice to it either. The raita did nothing to improve it, the biryani gets a thumbs down from me. To sum up then, Box8 offers excellent value for money, by and large quite tasty fares, in generously sized portions. I am inclined to try more items on their menu, especially their meals, I shall update this review once that's done."
5,"Gulam jamun and gajar halwa both are hot and tasty. Specially those small gulab jamun were really soft. The sweetness of Gajar halwa was perfect. And I found no added colors in it
Quantity was good.
And food was really awesome..
I enjoyed it. Service was very excellent.
Talking about packing of gulab jam was very good. No leakage. It was awesome."
1,Without any information my order is cancelled and no refund money yet which i pay online. And there is no customer care services available and given wrong cc number. To whom I contact and where I have to asking my money
4,Neat and clean area maintained by staff. Eat club is famous for its tasty food.
2,"Ordered the veg mushroom box and bhuna mutton biryani the other day. It was just okay, but everything had a particular sour taste that we don't expect from Box8. We found the food from the Box8 at Wadala/Antop Hill was much better. Hoping for better consistency across franchises."
4,Nice ambience. Located on main road. Good parking space. Staff is very much attentive. Food is too good. We ordered korean rice and gravy both in prawns. Prawns were fresh too. Loved the overall vibe of this restaurant.
1,"As per attached bill, I have ordered my favorite dish 1 BNT Chilly Rice. I take parcel & open at my office, instead of Bnt Chilly rice i got Chkn fried rice with gravy.
I want to confirm where my order is correct or not. I explained what i got in parcel, but the receptionist as well as cook given replay me, they had given right parcel to me. Which was not acceptable."
4,"Lehsuni chicken tikka was nice and biryani was good not like hyderabadi biryani ...north indian biryani i can say it was. Good for dining.
Overall good."
3,I and my friend had dinner here one of the nights we were in Dadar. The ambiance was good and the food recommendations were great.¬†but Service very delay..
4,Tasty food üòã great service and the best Chinese and Indian food around dadar
4,"Very old style restaurant, serving kokni Misal(one with watana/peas usal) and they've still managed to maintain their original taste till date. This is restaurant from the era when Mumbai had mill workers and so early morning hours you'll see people having their teas and the navtaak dudh(cream milk) I still don't know why they call it navtaak.
Other thing you can try is their Puri bhaaji and paapdi sev.
That's it ! Just good for three things.

And yes value for money is 4.5/5"
2,Good food. Food service order is slow.
5,Good work
5,Maharashtrian non vegetarian fare
3,Best for ordinary people
1,"Minus rating!!!
Cheating people. In indiabulls app they had a wallet option. If we click their it goes to dhani pay. I added 500 rs in it but i am not able to use it. After complaining so many times yet problem not solved. After mailing them always replying same msg and ticket closed assuming  by their own side that problem resolved. I have not paid their last instalment. For that they are properly calling me but for  my money not a single call."
4,"High rise buildings,
Give you a feel of international business area.

Situated very close to lower Parel, elphinston railway station.

View of the sea link as well as rail track is accessible.

Ideal for many flim shootings."
1,Services starts at 1.00 pm at one India bulls centre.... huge queue from 12.30 onwards.... the person who makes roti reaches not before 1.00 pm... loss of business for hungry bulls as customers shift to other options.... frustration for customers
1,"They increased rate of interest few months after disbursement still increasing
Not given valid reason. Don't take it loan from Indiabulls they are cheaters"
5,India Bulls Finance Centre is an excellent office premise. There are three towers. Tower 2 is mostly dedicated to Yes Bank.
2,"I have been a lover of the LPQ chain for quite some time now, have visited their eateries in different parts of the world and each time has been a good experience, however, the LPQ at India Bulls is purely ruining the name of this famous chain. I understand that this branch is only a small stall in a corporate building but serving SUCH horrible coffee is no excuse when you‚Äôre representing your brand.

As LPQ is overpriced, one would expect the best quality and service but this branch, in particular, ruined my image of LPQ itself."
3,"A big fan of LPQ, I decided to spend my lovely afternoon here in Mumbai at the Lower Parel (Indiabulls) outlet. Out comes this not-so-coffee-mug looking bowl with my pool of coffee. After staring at this bowl for a bit, not knowing how to consume the dark liquid inside, I decided to enjoy my coffee by swimming in this beauty. I am sure the other patrons wouldn‚Äôt have appreciated that quite so, so I finally licked my coffee off like how my cat, Pickles does.

I was curious about the choice of this weird vessel and did some background research. Alain, the founder of LPQ, used to cup his hands around this warm bowl of coffee, letting the warmth seep into his body and chase away winter‚Äôs frigid chill.
Well, that made sense because he was in Belgium.
I'm here in Mumbai, at 32 degrees. No, thank you sir, I do not need hand warmer bowls!

As for my lovely afternoon, well, NOT so lovely anymore."
4,"Great ambiance, good food but a bit costly ( view of the tower as seen from dadar footover bridge)"
4,"Tried their chicken lemon coriander sandwich and totally loved it! It's good portion for a decent breakfast. It was fresh, soft and tasty. Service was very polite and honest. They also accept TR card. Good job! Only thing I can suggest is to reduce price and make it reasonable for repeat footfalls. Paid 210 for it. I think 80‚Äî100 rs. is reasonable range for it. What's the point if I like it but can't afford it for everday breakfast, so team Le Pain please take a note."
3,Very nice food specially pizzas and ambience is also good
5,"We recently went to a restaurant near the Bandra-Worli Sea Link on the Worli side, and we had a really good time.

The location is convenient, especially if you‚Äôre driving, because they have parking available, which is hard to find in this area.

The food was the best part. If you love non-veg, especially chicken, you‚Äôll enjoy it here. The chicken dishes were full of flavor and cooked perfectly.

The staff was very friendly and always ready to help. They made sure we had everything we needed and were quick to respond.

Overall, it‚Äôs a great place to visit if you‚Äôre looking for good food and nice service."
3,I visited this restaurant almost 15+ times I like their staff and service and of course food though
4,"Not to speak much about the ambiance and quick service. But the food, it's spot on.
Crab Lollipop and Prawns Butter Garlic is a must try. They have hikes the rates by 20% so it doesn't justify the price as the ambiance is dull and boring. Hoping that they would enroll themselves on Zomato/Swiggy bookings."
5,"Amazing place, nice Interior, humble staff, Neat & clean hotel, Perfect food, Very pleasant environment, not noisy at all, Perfect to go with Family. Thanks to Manager n other staff for serving us very quickly üëç"
4,We had fish tikka it was delicious.. butter chicken was average...fish fry was delicious too..
5,"Creative and tasty (vegetarian only) food, in a creative space. Expensive, but worth it. Try the veg ramen and naan sampler"
5,Incredible food. Portions sized so that you can try several dishes at a time.
4,"Very interesting conceit and great food. Excellent cocktails too! Love the ambience, but too loud! Can hear the music from the nightclubs nearby."

5,Nice restaurant and bar . Amazing food the ceviche was a star dish pork belly bows and black cod was outstanding ‚Ä¶ the picante was the beat here cudnt resist and had afew .. the ambiance was nice at around 11/1130 the whole place transforms into a club like atmosphere with great music
5,"Uff such mind-blowing food! And the cocktails are amazing too. The servers are well trained to recommend perfectly as per taste, just that service on weekdays is a bit too relaxed.
An off beat location which kinda adds to the character of the place..
It can get expensive for a long night but it's really worth the money spent. The pan fried gnocchi, the half avocado and the potato mille feuille all blew our mind! Sooo good!"
5,"It‚Äôs one of the coolest places in town! I‚Äôve been visiting Slink frequently since the last 2 years and they‚Äôve never disappointed.

The hostess Ankita, always takes such good care of us. She‚Äôs always super nice and checks in on us.

My go to drink here is the whisky sour!! They make it so well. I would highly recommend trying out their cocktails! They maybe a lil expensive but so damn good.

After dinner it turns into a proper bar, the music is always üî•üî•üî• I‚Äôve seen some really cool artists perform here."
5,"A lovely speakeasy located in an unassuming part of Worli, the moment you enter Slink & Bardot, you are engulfed in the aroma and sounds of the atmosphere that they have created here. It‚Äôs a large space that‚Äôs broken down into smaller rooms. The ambience is cozy and it is a dimly lit space for most part.

The drinks and the food were absolutely on point. Although the prices were on the expensive side, it is worth the quality and the service. I had a gin based cocktail and my partner had a smoky whiskey cocktail, and both were perfect. The food and the dessert they recommended were phenomenal as well.

Our trip here made for a lovely date night and a fond memory. Highly recommend and will certainly visit again."
3,"Meal on Wheels: @pravasmumbai A new themed restaurant, serving authentic Gujarati thali. The decor and ambiance is superb make you feel like you are traveling in Rajdhani, with three boogies and comfortable seating arrangement. The name of restaurant Pravas means travel, totally justifying the theme.
They have live chat counter which servers Pani Puri, ragda Puri and chaat. They do serve Jain meal as well.
But the place is Overpriced and service is very slow."
4,"Pravas intrigues one by its decora itself .
Made in train with a royal decora feel inside and umbrellas on the onset , it's so beautiful .
Pravas is the go to place for gujju food .
I loved my welcome drink which was Ahmedabad Sorbet a mix of sour and sweet made in a fancy glass
Coming to the basics , the thaali has option of chaat or without chaat .
I love the composition of their thali .
They had the Gujarati famous Olo or Baingan Bharta with rotli.
And oh not to forget the puran polis dipped in ghee.
From khaman dhokla to kachoris to my papad and friams they had it .
I am still dreaming about the heavy lunch which made me fall asleep then
They also have chaat centre which has yum karara chaat, palak chaat , paani puri, ragda Patrice .
My favorite was the rasmalai. It was so yummy .
They also have staple dishes like Paneer , aloo, bhindi, dal, kadhi.
Their khichdi is simple and Warm .
And yes not to forget the chaas which is a must staple .
I had the dum paan which was a thick drink with a very strong flavour at the end making it so lovely and refreshing
At the end I had mango dessert made in matki which was thick and sweet

Overall it is a great place to go back to your roots and eat some good food"
4,"Perfect place for Family and group dining.
Veg only place which serves drinks. Train Coach Concept Restaurant with a nice Gujrati menu. Non Spicy. Healthy Good Food."
3,"Ambience great
Service good
Ac not cool enough, may be it was a hot day
Food Ok to Fair.
Lucky we read many negative reviews so didn't expect anything great. But we're not disappointed either. Nor happily surprised.
Food wise, for Gujarati Thali will anyday prefer Thakar's, Samrat or Status.
None of the dishes were worth writing about, except perhaps Gulabjamun, soft and juicy.
Tried only Thali. A la carte Menu very sparse."
3,Thali was average . Rangda Patice and chat amazing... The drink Mango Delight is a Must try!
4,"The place has a great setup with a lively ambience üéÆ, but the experience was disappointing as many games were not working, making it frustrating to find ones that did. Additionally, there was no staff to guide on how to play or what to do, which made it confusing, especially for first-time visitors. With better maintenance and assistance, this could be a great gaming spot, but for now, it needs improvement to offer a smoother experience."
5,"I went to try out some games, and there were a lot of options available. To play, you need a Smash card. If you want to get a new Smash card, it costs 5,000. There are various activities, including 8 ball pool, bowling, and games for children. Live music is also available, adding to the vibrant atmosphere. Next to the bowling area, there are food options. Overall, I had a great experience and thoroughly enjoyed my day!"
1,"I ordered as per this offer.. i waited for 20 minutes for the first beer, when I asked for the second one, his face was like I'm begging him...

After 10 minute wait, I got the second beer...

When I asked for the third beer, they were like you have to wait again for 20 minutes....
Fraud company and fraud offer...

Always remember... The customer is the king..

If you can't give the offer, don't give such promotions"
4,Good for children. Many games can be enjoyed by elders as well.  Food included in our package was good and portion size was huge.
5,"Smaaash Utopia City is an amazing entertainment zone with VR games, go-karting, bowling, and more. The cricket simulator was my favorite! Perfect for a weekend hangout."
5,"Anandashram Hotel is a fantastic choice for those looking for authentic, budget-friendly vegetarian food with a touch of old-world charm. The flavors are rich and satisfying, and the friendly staff make you feel right at home. This place carries a timeless quality that adds to the warm, welcoming experience."
5,"When our hungry stomachs decided it was time to eat, we went to the first restaurant that caught our eye: Hotel Anandashram. We ordered a simple meal with masala papad, jeera rice, solkadhi, paneer crispy, and dal tadka. Everything was delicious and came at an affordable price. The staff was incredibly humble and polite. I highly recommend this place to anyone passing through the shopping streets of Dadar West."
3,"Okaish Food in emergency. Don't expect great taste. If ordered Chinese like fried rice, they don't give Schezwan Chutney. If you demand they charge 15 rupees extra."
4,"Good quality food with affordable rates. The hotel provides a variety of vegetarian options to choose from chinese, punjabi to south Indian cuisines. We have tried their Pav bhaji, chilli paneer and Solkadi. The quality of the food was good and hygienic. A must visit near dadar station if you are in search of pure veg food with a variety of options."
5,"Great place for pure vegetarian meals, I have been here several times for breakfast & tried their Puri bhaaji and Idli Vada. One weird thing I have noticed is they sometimes handover the bill to you, before you are done eating your meal."
4,"Milan palace located near Phatak Road, Bhayander. Its popular as a party hall and veg buffets.

If you are foody, you must visit this place. We got an unlimited buffet @420Rs per pax for adults. They serve 30+ food items. It includes 2 types of soups, 4 starters, 4 chats, 3 Indian main courses, 6 Chinese and 4 types of deserts.

I feel like I am visiting a marriage function with a wide variety of food items. Food quality is awesome.

They have live music, music on demand and karaoke available. Plenty of open space available for dance.

Place is perfectly suitable for group gathering, families and met up.

Food lovers must visit place. Overall delightful experience üëç"
5,"Superb fast service, cooperative staff, and tasty food and amazing ambiance, music üòä"
4,"A fine dine restaurant  only for Saturday/ Sunday evening.
The main business  line is Banquet hall  for functions.
Live music. One can have food at leisure here. That is the best part.
Management  serves welcome drink and various Starters at your table. Live counter for panipuri and varity od Dosa.
Main course one has to help themselves at buffet counter.
Over All good experience."
5,"Excellent place. Guys if you are voracious eaters, or even if you are good eaters, then this is the place. Electrifying atmosphere, live Bollywood songs, karaoke, your choices etc, dance, and above all, The Boss, himself seeing that you are not only comfortable but enjoying enough. One of the best place. Food and everything of 1st class. Desi ghee, basmati rice, excellent quality food. Best lemon juice and so many more..... couldn't eat all... Thanks to the Big Boss Mr Williams ü´°"

4,"The food was average, but I was really impressed with the cleanliness and fast service."
5,"Had a dinner with cousins recently. Amazing staff as always, We sat in the AC section, the place is a bit cozy but very clean and tidy.

As for the food, we ordered Chicken Crispy and Chicken Hong King Fried Rice.

It was served to our table within 5-10 mins of ordering which is very quick.

The food was hot and tasty and spice levels were medium (Enough for most people).
Quantity was Alright , each dish had enough portions for 2 people.

I recommend anyone looking for a consistently good meal to visit Spenta."
4,Nice decent restaurant with lovely interior for ac rooms and quality sweet and spicy taste üòã. They have daily 'today's special ' which is class. Saturday was chicken peshwari which was unique taste and soft chicken. For veg paneer Shanghai sweet and spicy taste gud appetizer.
5,"One of the best hotels in Mira Road.
We keep ordering frim this hotel and love the food.
In terms of pricing,quality and quantity.
In all the aspects they are best.
Today i tried their oriental Chickn, Chicken Banjara kebab, chicken sholay, in starter and chicken lakhnavee with butter roti. Was just yummy. It is good for family dining as well as open. They have different partition for family with ac. Service is good and the taste is just awesome none of above dish disappointed us in terms of taste as well as quantity. Size of roti is huge.
Must try."
4,"Great taste and good quality along with adequate quantity of food.
Ordered Chicken Crispy first- Taste was superb, actually crisp and smooth, made with patience it seems.
Next it was Chicken Hakka noodles- again taste was amazing, different from usual what restaurants offer it to be. Quantity and quality go hand in hand.Yummy food overall!!

4,"The chicken starters are pretty great, those who love spicy chicken they will find it to their liking. I tried their chicken crispy, apple/Dry lollipops  and chicken tandoori,all of them were delicious. The chicken noodles were also very tasty and up to the mark,one thing its one serving of noodles is enough for two people. Must try their other gravy dishes too especially with the Nan or Tandoori roti."
1,"I recently purchased a Masala Dry Lollipop from this restaurant, but unfortunately, it was a terrible experience. (28-10-2024) The lollipop smelled awful, like it had been stored in the fridge for weeks. It was clear that it wasn't freshly made. I wasted ‚Çπ230 on it. Based on this experience, I would advise against buying food from this restaurant."
5,"Nice place to have a sip of drinks with your friends and also with your family in the family section
It has good food and reasonable rates for drinks
Just outside the station so you can sit and relax after a tiring journey"
4,"Dear Sir,

Ordered Mutton Handi Gawti style and received a bill more than the price on the Menu shared by you.

Feedback- This is also the first time in at least a year being a customer of you the dish was also less cooked

Attached the picture of bill and your Menu"
3,"Very conveniently located vegetarian restaurant at Mira Bhayandar locality. I will specially appreciate this place for being very very pocket friendly but still maintains the authenticity of taste of almost all dishes.
It may be lunch, b/f or dinner, everything is very cheap and tasty. Dishes are just adequate in quantity so no scope of wastage.
I will appreciate the gentle staff who are very quick to respond. The place is full of middle class people and is busy most of the time.
The waiting time till the ordered dish arrives is also considerably  short.
Ambience matches typical Udupi style .
Cleanliness is considerably far better then one expects out of this very simple place.
Parking is convenient and sufficient."
5,Great place to be with your friend and family with good food and tea pure veg
4,"Sitting space is little congested, good is fine, worth the money. Staff can get little more friendly. Overall fine. Veg pulav is something i liked from here. Dal fry was also decent. We ordered veg kolhapuri it was littler more spicy."
1,"Below Average food. Ordered paneer kolhapuri, it was very sour in taste. Poor quality"
5,I ordered food from abhishek pure veg restaurant. I had been there many times because they serve good quality food and taste is amazing.  I recently ordered veg handi and butter tandoori roti and a garlic naan. Food quantity is also good. And now in lockdown period they are available to take orders from 11am to 4pm and 7pm to 10pm and delivery charges they may take.
5,Good & Fantastic & Mr.Shetty (Owner) anna good person and every time laughing.
4,No limit to extend the time till u ask for the bill
5,Very much changes after a long time i have visited
5,Its Nice bar and service is also good
3,It's a restaurant and bar. Good place to booze
1,"Mention specific issues like overcooked meat, bland flavors, stale ingredients, incorrect orders"
4,"Food was up to the mark the typical chinese that you expect from a Chinese Point.

Had veg. Shecz. Triple rice and it was good 4 stars"
1,"Had bad experience
Last day had tripple fried rice & there is one wood pice in rice.. they didn't compensate in price charged.."
5,"This is a small place but the food is amazing. The place was recommended by a close friend. I have been looking for places that have good chefs and have evaluated the chefs on some complex dishes like American Chopsuey, Spring Roll and Mixed Fried Rice. The chef is amazing and did justice to all three dishes. The taste was good, ambience was warm and the staff was very courteous. This has become my regular ""Go to place when hungry"". I would rate this place an 8 out of 10. I would even recommend it for a family dinner, friends hangout place and even a couples dining place. Covid protocols are observed which is a mandate here. Has a small parking place in the front. You need to visit, eat and then you would actually know. They even have a home delivery option for those who prefer home dining."
5,"One of the oldest Chinese restaurant in this area serves affordable tasty Chinese both veg as well as non-veg Chinese food. These people give free home delivery. The price is comparatively less from other Chinese restaurants. As this area does not have non-veg restaurant, this Chinese restaurant is a good option to have non-veg food. The owner of the restaurant should try to list this restaurant on online food delivery platforms so that many other people can try it's best food."
3,Best shop get all Bhikaji product but check expiry date before buy. You will get all packed product . U will not get any spl sweets as  shop. All items are vacuum packed you will get only fresh rasgulla and gulab jamun . Rest other shop is ok. Owner is helpful while selecting of product so that you can easily select the product
2,Products are good but they have no carry bags also....many a times....imagine carrying a Transparent box of Rasgulla on the road to your home....its a shame !!!
4,Lots of variety sweets and snacks. Taste is awesome. All sweets are made of pure ghee.
5,"Very Very good quality sweet‚Äôs and cookies, owner very supportive in all respects"
5,Best Family that is running the shop.. Very Polite and Gentle All members of the family.
1,"Stale cake had foul smell. No way to contact the store,  number listed on Google is invalid waste of money. While buying the staff did inform politely to keep the cake outside for half an hour before consumption that will enhance the cake taste as it is a chocolate cake if only I realised at that time I wouldn't have bought it"
1,"pukeee...pukeeee

free fly,hair strand..

stale n old..!!yukssss"
4,Amazing staff and pastry was very delicious and fresh must recommended
1,worst experience. inexperienced staff. gave me other flavour in the name of swiss chocolate. denied replacement also. happened again and again.
1,"I paid 520rs for A half kg Chocolate cake. Not at all worth it for 520rs
Also I bought A Red Velvet Pastry & Rainbow Pastry. One of the worst Red Velvet and Rainbow Pastry I ever had. Will never visit this Specific Monginis ever."
1,"Extremely Disappointed & Deeply Offended! Serious Complaint
I had one of the worst experiences ever at Domino‚Äôs. I specifically ordered a Veggie paradise pizza, but was shockingly served a NON-VEG PIZZA. This is not just a mistake, it's a violation of trust and deeply offensive for people who follow strict vegetarian diets.

When I confronted them, the Manager DERICK was not only unapologetic, but also behaved in a vulgar, rude, and aggressive manner. He outright refused to refund the amount and showed zero accountability. His disgusting attitude is a serious red flag for any customer.

To make things worse, the toilets were in a horrible state, completely unclean and stinking very badly. It was extremely unhygienic and unbearable, and clearly shows the lack of basic cleanliness and respect for customers.

I have all the necessary evidence bills, photos, and proof of their behaviour and I am going to file a formal complaint with the Consumer Court. This level of carelessness and misconduct cannot be ignored.

To everyone reading this: STAY AWAY from this outlet. It‚Äôs unsafe, unclean, and run by staff with zero professionalism.

i have mailed everything on guestcaredominos&jublfood.com"
1,"No one was available for taking orders. Uncleaned area. Wrong pizza order taken
Took 50 min to get my pizza. Also after taking time to prepare another one, taste was not good. Too much suffocated place."
1,"Extremely disappointed with the delivery experience today. I have been waiting for over 55 minutes for my order. The delivery person‚Äôs phone was continuously busy, and the store's number was switched off.
To make matters worse, the delivery person entered the wrong building and spoke rudely, blaming us for not having a bell system in the building. His behavior was completely unprofessional and raised concerns about whether he was in the right state to be working.
This level of service is unacceptable, especially from those who claims to deliver in under 30 minutes. If timely and professional delivery cannot be ensured, please revisit your commitments."
1,No water service for handwash no proper language using with customer not order providing in scheduled time
1,Dear dominoz really very disappointed with the service and staff  they had literally made brand as worst i had an worst experience visiting this branch
4,"I recently visited Buntas and had a delightful dining experience. The highlight of the meal was undoubtedly the Chicken Tandoori Lollipop, which was exceptionally flavorful and cooked to perfection. The spices were well-balanced, and the meat was tender and juicy The ambiance of Buntas was welcoming, and the service was prompt and friendly."
2,"Food was very disappointing. Everything was tasteless. We had ordered Chicken Tandoori, Butter Naan and Chicken Handi and plain rice. Except plain rice everything was horrible, no taste, no arroma, as if we are eating some meat simply boiled in water and added salt.
It was complete waste of money. Ambiance is also looks so dull and boaring. It was Monday so service was prompt, staff behaviour was Good. But important thing Food was really really bad. Not at all advisable."
4,Good place for family... good food ...specially privacy
4,Very good place. Its a restaurant bar with outdoor sitting in dhaba theme. It also has ac room with good ambience. Rates of drinks is normal as in other restaurant bars.
1,"Was a good restaurant till date however they screwed our day.
Orthodox management asking couples to sit opposite or leave the restaurant as if every couple is making nuisance and spreading obsencity.
Would never recommend nor visit anytime soon in our lives..
BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.."
5,"""Great Experience at McDonald's Bhayandar West!

I had a great time at McDonald's in Bhayandar West. The food was fresh and tasted really good, just as expected. The service was quick, and the staff was friendly. The ambiance was clean and comfortable, making it a nice place to enjoy a meal. Plus, the pricing was reasonable‚Äîspent around ‚Çπ1000 and got good value for money. Overall, a very nice experience!"""
1,"Disappointing Visit ‚Äì Far Below McDonald‚Äôs Usual Standards

My recent visit to this McDonald‚Äôs  left me thoroughly disappointed, especially compared to the cleanliness and efficiency I‚Äôve come to expect from the brand.

Cleanliness (or Lack Thereof):
The restrooms were an absolute nightmare. Walking in, I was hit by an overpowering stench that made it hard to stay inside. The floors were sticky, trash bins overflowed, and the toilets looked like they hadn‚Äôt been cleaned in hours. It‚Äôs shocking for a well-known chain like McDonald‚Äôs, where hygiene should be a top priority.

Atmosphere ‚Äì Chaotic and Noisy:
The dining area was uncomfortably loud, with constant shouting from and loud conversations echoing off the walls. It felt more like a crowded market than a family-friendly restaurant, making it impossible to enjoy a quick meal in peace.

While the food itself was decent (as always), the overall experience was marred by the filthy restrooms and chaotic environment. This location seriously needs to step up its maintenance and crowd management to align with McDonald‚Äôs reputation. I hope this was just an off day, but until improvements are made."
3,Not that great as other outlets a lot of youngsters to be seen .. The quality of French Fries was not at all good. The size was of a new born baby fingers got it replaced but the second batch too was the same. There is no AC cooling for someone who's planning to sit near the order counter.  Service was good no complaints about it
5,"Located opposite Maxus Mall, this McDonald's may be small, but seating is usually available. Ideal for families, kids, or solo visits. They offer table service, an order kiosk, a paid celebration chamber, high tables, and a cozy dining vibe."
5,McDonalds Menu deserves 5 stars. Everything is so tasty. The Vibe and Music is Good. Visited here at least twice or thrice a month. And it's a nice place to eats without any disturbance. And make me relax. The best and cheapest fast food centre for all the youngsters to chill out here. The place is quite and cool and  Employees were all wearing face mask and gloves when taking orders and handling food
5,"The food taste and quality is good. There are many options in sandwiches, pizzas and burgers. Only downside is their service is too slow because Raju takes his own time and prepare the dishes that's why all its dish taste good. And also the prices are quite reasonable. I would highly recommend if you are craving for pizza, burger or sandwich."
5,"The Taste is very good.
You can try the Cheese chilli toast with 3 different chutney which are the main highlight.
Moderately priced."
5,"Its crowded on Sunday most

They don't have proper management.

They have many options but not appropriate service

After ordering sandwich for kid it was spicy

The owner who used to prepare sandwich few years back is not available through out the day and employees don't prepare food properly and mismanagement of order and payments also

Specially you can see many a times user have a free sandwich bcoz one person is busy with preparing of food and other with delivery but they don't take a care who had eat sandwich and went without pay...

Free funder can try this trick..üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
4,"Taste of food awesome. Due to high order seevice is little slow, so you have to wait on weekends.  Overall nice food one shpuld try"
5,"Use to fresh vegetable this Food center

Chicken lungfung soup is one the best soup i ever had in Chinese point . The servive is also excellent , only in weekend you need to wait for a longer period of time to get your hunger over at Chinese point"
5,You will get the best type of Chinese food here even at reasonable rates. I've tried veg food which was absolutely delicious .

Dishes to try: chicken kolhapuri, mix fried rice, chicken Sharmili

Our go to a restaurant for office parties, and we ordered parcel every time.
This restaurant have different varieties of chicken and mutton gravy, feel free to try it, they are really unique and delicious.

Let's talk about chinese, chinese here is Indian Chinese like all the chillia restaurant make, I really like chinese here.
Not authentic chinese but ok."
1,"Absolutely Horrible ‚Äì Stay Away!

Arfat Restaurant is hands down one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. The food was disgusting‚Äîtasteless, poorly cooked, and felt like it had been sitting out for hours. I wouldn‚Äôt even feed it to a stray animal!

To make things worse, they didn‚Äôt have change when I tried to pay. How does a business not have basic change? It was incredibly unprofessional and frustrating. The staff didn‚Äôt seem to care at all, and the whole place felt mismanaged and unclean.

Save yourself the disappointment and go somewhere else. This place is a complete joke!"
4,Enjoyed Chicken Lajawaab and Chicken Hyderabadi. Quantity is less but taste is awesome.  Loved Butter Chapati and even Biryani Rice was good.  Approx 200 per person.
5,"Arfat is one of my go to place of all time, it is the best budget friendly restaurant the quantity they provide is quite good and reasonable according to the price. They have ac and non section

1,"Taste of this chinese hotel is gud but the home delivery takes a hell of time up to 45 mins

Amd its becoming a night bar"
5,"Food is very delicious, and the prices are also reasonable. Love it ..!!"
3,Very slow service but they've maintained their restaurant nicely
1,This place is not bar and restaurant then too they allow drinking in their premises. So for a family time please think twice..
2,Taste is ok bt quantity of food is very  less
5,Amazing and delicious food i like that all the food was pure veg and the quality and quantity both were awesome
5,The place is quite nice. The food served is clean and tasty. It is a good place for nucleated families rather than joint families as the premises are a bit short for them. Overall the food quality is very good. Would personally like to advice someone to give it a try.
3,"1.Food quantity & taste is amazing... But it has very low hygiene standards around the shop....
2.The staff there doesn't ever have sanitizer and have not wore any mask..."
4,"Mouth watering dosas as well as want to appreciate the kind of idli he had even at night .

Tried peri peri cheese Mayo dosa whicha was awesome, some sada dosa and last but not the least Mysore Masala Dosa"
4,"It's a quick bite place best taste with best price only drawback is pure veg it is situated in khau gali bhayander west & it is very old but menu is limited only pav bhaji, pulav & Chinese available but very crowded"

5,"Very good restaurant, Food and services are good rate reasonable"
4,Best for non-veg dishes. Try any non veg dish you gonna love it.
1,Daily daru Wale jaye. Not good for friends party and never for family. It's just like desi theka. Don't go there. Waste of money waste of energy. Waiters and manager's treat you like drunker.
1,"Today I have visited this place for Lunch took 3 items Chicken Crispy , triple chicken rice and a bottle of water.

In the menu they have mentioned cheaper price and after having the food the person provided bill with higher amount then the actual amount mentioned in the menu card.

Please note that the amount was not raised because of GST however they were duping the customers by stating that the menu card is of before lockdown. It's too long that the lockdown has been passed still gives silly reason.

When asked for owner of restaurant the manager asked for internal settlement to reduce the amount and pay the bill.

Please do not visit such place where such misappropriation is going around."
4,The quality & taste of food is good & prices are very cheap.
5,"Food is good, prices are best"
2,"My friend and I visited Domino's in Bhayander (east) for the first time and tried the Volcano Double Chicken Pizza. Unfortunately, the pizza did not look or taste as expected based on the description and visuals. It was overly salty, and to make matters worse, the pizza was stuck to the box, causing the pieces to break apart while trying to serve.

The service was also disappointing, and the oregano was kept in a small steel salt box, which seemed old and unappealing. Additionally, the AC was turned on only after we entered, making the initial experience uncomfortable.

I hope these issues can be addressed to improve the quality of food and service. Thank you."
1,"Extremely Disappointing Experience at Domino's. I visited this Domino's outlet today, and unfortunately, my experience was marred by multiple issues.
Service Issues
1. Delayed Order: I waited 30 minutes for my food, with no update or apology from the staff.
2. Unhelpful Staff: The order-taker seemed dismissive and uninterested in resolving my concerns.
3. Poor Communication: Staff failed to provide accurate information about menu items and availability.
Ambiance Issues
1. Broken Menu Display: The TV screen displaying the menu was not working.
2. Uncomfortable Temperature: The AC wasn't functioning, making the atmosphere unbearable.
3. Insufficient Lighting: Dim lighting made it more difficult.
Food and Beverage Issues
1. Inventory Discrepancies: Staff claimed Pepsi Black was unavailable, despite seeing it stocked in the fridge.
*Overall Experience*
My visit to Domino's was frustrating and disappointing. Fundamental issues with service, ambiance, and communication undermined my trust."
3,"Domino's Pizza used to be my top choice for satisfying pizza cravings, but lately, it seems to have lost a bit of its charm. The taste remains consistent, but there's a missing spark that once made it stand out."
5,I hve always loved Domino's. Whether it's for the same pizzas or the garlic bread. It has always been picket friendly to me and has served the best . The delivery and service was on time. Loved it and highly recommended to all pizza lover's. Always stayed to upto the mark.
1,"Worst pizza I ever had in Dominos, the quality of pizza is pathetic. The premise is unhygienic, toilets were stinking not cleaned and staffs were unhygienic. First time I saw oil floating in pizza."
1,I have buy chicken cutlet & chicken puff I was having it there in outlet but i found a stone in Chicken puff when I show this to the person who was incharge of the outlet but his no response... Late night they don't recycle spoil food items....be alert before you visit this outlet make sure if you have any food complaint they won't resolve.....
5,"Chocolate cake was just awesome üëå...long time after ate this tasty cake‚ò∫Ô∏è ...flavour, look was too good....thank you Monginis , maked my birthday special üéâüëç"
1,"If someone comes with a kid to have a pastry then at least you should offer table so kid can have a pastry but I get a response this is not a restaurant, you should put a notice on your gate, only takeaway.

Purchased 2 rainbow cheese pastry one other last month 10th of Feb."
1,"I bought a pastry it turned out to be useless and foam was coming out of it.

I have buy this pastry from BHYANDER east shop don't buy from here it's not a good."
1,On August mu friends bought a cake for my birthday but it didn't taste great so we gave the cake back and shared our concern about the cake stating it was not that freadh and the cream tasted weird to us and they took the cake because it was going to their head office to have a review if the cake was good or not and told us they will contact us and they might get a ans from the head office within 10 days. But even after a month we didn't review any cake or any alternative cake. And till date we have not received anything. Not a cake no money because from the cake we didn't even utilised 15% of the cake. Every bad experience.
5,"If you are looking for a party hall that can accommodate a small number of guests and has excellent ambience, then we have a recommendation. We reviewed a party hall located right adjacent to Mira-Bhayander road and were impressed with the overall experience.

1. Ambience and Decorations:

The ambience of the party hall was excellent and made for a great atmosphere to celebrate. The decorations provided by the Hall staffs were top-notch, and all the guests were happy with them. The hall had a great vibe and was perfect for a small gathering.

2. Air Conditioning and Washrooms

The AC was working great, and the temperature inside the hall was perfect. Even on a hot day, the air conditioning kept the hall cool and comfortable. The washrooms were also clean and well-maintained, adding to the overall experience.

3. Location and Parking

The party hall is situated in a convenient location right adjacent to Mira-Bhayander road, making it easy to find. However, parking is available at your own risk. It is important to note that the party hall is situated on the first floor, and there is no elevator. This might cause inconvenience to older groups of people or handicap guests."
5,"Nice party hall...I was celebrated my son birthday ü•≥.  It was great arrangement....umid se jyda achha, staff bhi achhe se guest ko handle kiye. Budget friendly üòâ"
4,"A very good Party Hall for small parties,
Very good Arrangement, fancy Decoration, Good food."
5,"This is one of the best halls in Mira road area , there are 3 floors available so you can decide as per your crowd and convenience , excellent facilities as well as good management , my recommendation for Birthday , Haldi , Mehandi , Communion and small weddings ."
2,"I had been here for a function. The place is old and it's shouting for a renovation. I think this banquet will get more bookings if they renovate the place. It is located at the prime location, bang on the Mira Bhayandar road highway. The staff is polite and courteous."

1,"It's very bad Chinese center
No tast in food"
2,"Poor experience not once,  but everytime I have visited this KFC branch at Miraroad. Hot and Crispy chicken was tasteless.  Peri Peri wings did not have Peri Peri powder.  We had to ask for it. First floor was stinking of dead rat and was unable to sit. The AC on the ground floor was not working."
3,Food quality too bad. Popcorn served were soggy. Staff denied for extra seasoning after being ready for extra payment.
3,The food was good  and the seating arrangement was nice but the order taking guy name Mr. Omkar was not at all focused on his work  and we were feeling like he was not interested in taking any order.
1,"hi sir/madam,
i am mustufa manakia
Recently I went to a KFC outlet which is in Mira Road, I placed an order at 8:30pm and I received it after 1:30 hours. When I told the manager, he talked very rudely. There was a girl also named Priyanka, she also talked rudely and the manager said whoever wants to complain should do so,
And it is taking so much time to place the order and instead of talking nice to me he is talking very rudely, please take strict action
so my request to KFC is to fire such people from the job who spoil the customers.
and i attached the bill of the kfc outlet"
1,"Very disappointing experince.
The fries were cold and soggy and uncooked without any spices or salt.
The same goes for popcorn chicken, it was pathetic.
Also the quantity is way too less compared to prices.
Never ever will order from KFC"
5,"I had a great experience at Vijay Vada Pav, which is one of the best places to have vada pav in Bhayander. The vada pav was hot, crispy and delicious, with a generous amount of chutney and onion. The service was fast and friendly, and the price was very reasonable. The stall was clean and well-maintained, and had a lot of loyal customers. I would highly recommend Vijay Vada Pav to anyone who loves vada pav or wants to try it for the first time."
5,"One of the oldest snack shop at this place. In school days while returning we used to binge on snack items like samosa, vada, bread pattice, all types of bhajji etc. Chutney was amazing. Good place to have a quick bite.
Amazing taste & served hot every time.
Fast service, Very supportive staff. Good quality.
It attracts a lot of decent & trendy crowds on a daily basis. It brings nostalgic feelings thinking about the old days.
Speciality would be mouth watering samosa & pattice. Every one should try once. Worth the money."
4,"He has the best kind of the favorite Mumbai foods - vada pav, samosa pav and bhaji pav. His chutneys are top notch as well. Ask for the hottest item present and you won't be disappointed."
5,Best vada pav and samosas ever in bhayander east.... If u r going through this place it's suggested to eat once
5,"Finest Vada-Pav One Can Have With Good Quality.

P.S. -- Here my favorite is Samosa-Pav. :)"
1,"I ordered Chipotle chicken wrap from Faasoos, via Zomato, the chicken was uncooked. It was such a disgusting experience. Such places should not be listed on Zomato which will spoil the credibility of Zomato."
5,"Its all About quality if not quantity.
Always light on stomach.
Easily digested.
Food is well prepared and doesn't cut corners.
Most of the time I buy from here.
Price is justified by quality and hygiene.
Very well packaged.
Will definitely buy again and recommend to everyone.

3,"Average rolls, they can make it better. Its priced high but usually they have given enough offers everywhere so it becomes reasonable at the end. One good thing i liked that there teekha chaska powder also given in case if anyone wants to kake it extra spicy.. but inside it was average."
4,"Faasos never seems to disappoint when it comes to wraps be it veg or non veg, it always makes me happy.

The cheese melt paneer wrap was good, was quite cheesy and good amount of filling for a evening snack.

The cheesy corn salsa wrap had a tangy flavour to it. Like having pizza in a wrap, the flavour we're quite similar like tht of a pizza.

Coming to the meal the jumbo Chole rice was really good it serves upto three people after having the wraps

Quantity is quite good and the price is reasonable to the pockets."
3,"Food is nice
Quantity is less .
This was panner Chesse melt wrap there was generous amount of chesse n filling was good
But too much for the price"
5,"Nice outlet of McDonald's so nothing new to say here. There is ample seating downstairs as well as upstairs.
The service here is really good as they come and serve you at the table. There is everything you expect on the Menu and they even have Touch Kiosk for self service.
Parking is not available but the security guard outside will keep an eye on your vehicle if it's parked in front of the restaurant."
1,"I recently visited McDonald's and ordered an iced coffee. While I generally enjoy your coffee, I was disappointed with my recent experience. The cup was not filled to the top, leaving a noticeable gap, and there was far too much ice, which diluted the coffee and left me with less drink than expected.

I understand the need for ice in iced coffee, but this felt excessive and took away from the value of the drink. I hope this can be addressed, as it's important to get what you're paying for."
3,"Over all good atmosphere for young generation and for rich people... clean and self service...and as ....compare to food and cost it should be little cheaper so that all can effort to buy , when i visited i saw some parents was Searching for some cheaper amount food but they didn't found as a single burger also cost more then their budget...so they end up by leaving Mcdonald.."
1,"It's been three times.i've ordered a meal with a burger.but in the burger i got a hair , and the delivery driver is taking the phone to give him self a five star, even the order took 45 minutes to arrive
But when the replace the burger , the same thing happened
Please do not go to this McDonald's in specific"
1,"I'm not a fan of McDonald's, and have hardly visited the place. After years I visited it with my bestie. I wanted to order from the app. It had offers and the type of combo I wanted. But the person standing over the kiosk was like let me help you, he removed my order and made a 2  meal combo which I didn't want. I told him I don't want this meal. I want the combos from the app. He still made combos and asked to make payment. The app was offering discounts and the bill didn't. I accepted it as I was not in a mood to fight or argue. After half an hour 2-3 staff one after another started coming and were asking us to hurry up dining as they have customers in waiting. It was so rude of them to ask us to eat fast. I will never visit it again. Very disappointed"
1,Just don't waste ur money here worst restaurant ever...I have ordered paneer crispy half plate it costed me 190rs but it doesn't have paneer at all it was only fried cornflour and even quantity is also worst as compared to price I regreted so much.....so from my experience please don't waste ur money here....it was just capsicum with fried cornflour....TASTLESS!!!
3,"Had visited here 4 months back with my elder brother had enjoyed the food thoroughly but the owner seems a bit rude sometimes... I felt the that would be just a rather case but while going through the reviews I feel it has been consistent.

PS: The only reason I'm commenting today is because I returned back from India east and stopped by where I was asked for the review of this place.

Food is without a doubt Great but for the behaviour and dealing with customers who makes these places what it is today a huge üëé"
5,"A 2 decade old Chinese brand serving in the area, they are known for their delicious food. A no fuss, quick Chinese place; best to get food delivered. Their chicken dishes are worth trying and the new barbecue menu is very interesting."
4,"Visited the place in the evening around 8pm. We expected the restaurant to be full but were quite happy after noticing only 2 tables were occupied. Due to this, our order was ready in about 15 minutes. They have a wide range of dishes at reasonable prices. Overall, a good experience."
5,"Small place to sit and eat. Food is great. Quality and quantity is great for price.
Ideal for home delivery."
5,Loved their food very tasty & budget friendly!!
1,"I rarely give one-star reviews, but this experience deserves no stars at all. I ordered food to celebrate the New Year, but what I received was nothing short of disappointing‚Äîa complete waste of money.

1. Machow Soup: It was smelly and absolutely tasteless.

2. Chicken Lollipop: Completely uncooked with visible raw dough inside. It was bland and inedible.

3. Egg Fried Rice: They must have forgotten to add salt because it was flavorless. They provided vinegar on the side, but it didn‚Äôt help at all.

This was a terrible start to the new year. It‚Äôs clear they don‚Äôt care about online customers or the quality of their food. Please save your time and money and avoid ordering from this restaurant."
4,"The atmosphere makes u feel like a calm place in nepal or tibet.
I had pan fried momo, steam momo n fried momo all of them are good.
Wonton soup n prawns noodle soup both great nit prawns quantity very less."
5,I recently had authentic Chinese noodles from this restaurant and it blew my mind. I am not so much fond of noodles but these restuarant changed my mind today. Highly recommended for authentic Chinese dishes.
5,"Don't let the compact size of the place fool you, this is by far one of the best restaurants I've visited. It is Chinese cuisine made suited for us Indians and very economic. Must try. Great dishes for all kinds of people.

P.s I travel all the way from Vasai just to have this awesome food."
5,"Good taste, Quality products and counter staff was very helpful Suggested good cake for us"
1,"Last year i ordered cake for my son birthday, it was very tasteless and apart from that it  was very very moist.. And charged was very high. Don't purchase from these shop. You will get better cake than other local shop."
1,"Stale food, rude staff behaviour, no etiquettes. Go to any monginis, u will find all food items like burger, etc, been almost sold by evening, but this old man's shop keeps stale food, hence till night, u will find products unsold. If u say u don't keep fresh product, old man starts arguing and behaves rudely, as if u have made s mistake giving ur opinion. Pathetic shopkeeper. He doesn't know how to run a shop. Rudest shopkeeper i have ever seen. Self centred and rude person. Cz of his behaviour im sure people have stopped coming to this shop.. i hope he closes his shop soon. He has no etiquettes and doesn't know how to talk. Mannerless old man.  Dear owner this was a pure complaint and u have replied saying thank u for ur positive response? Check ur response in the attached photo."
1,"Worst place to buy any cake or puff etc. The biggest problem is their quality. No taste. Everything tastes so stale and without any quality. Better to go for local bakery rather than such bad brand. Had visited after 3 years and still they had such a bad taste only.

Will never go back again. Pls save your money and be wise in choosing shop. Save ur little kids from unhealthy and stale food items."
3,"I don't visit this store unless I have no other options. Cakes and pastries are average to taste and I feel their prices are higher compared to other cake shops, which offer better quality, quantity, prices and service. I never try their puffs and pizzas as I never found them fresh."
4,"It offers a decent pizza experience that balances convenience and flavor. While it may not be the best pizza you'll ever have, it certainly satisfies when you're in the mood for something quick  and easy.
Pros:
‚Ä¢Quick Service:  usually take 10 20 min
‚Ä¢Wide Variety: a good selection of pizzas, sides, and desserts
Cons:
‚Ä¢Smell: washroom smell to bad , should avoid near by seats
‚Ä¢Quality : The taste was average ... opinion can differ according to your taste"
1,"I had a very disappointing experience with Domino's recently. The staff were completely unprofessional-fooling around instead of attending to customers. I waited for a long time just to place an order, and no one seemed to care.
The service was extremely slow, and the employees were more interested in chatting among themselves than helping customers. It's unacceptable to pay for food and get treated like an inconvenience.
I expected better from a well-known chain like Domino's. If this is how they handle orders, I'd rather go somewhere else where customers are actually valued."
2,"The experience was disappointing. Their system was down, so they were taking orders manually, but they still charged GST without providing a bill. When I asked about it, the staff rudely said ""Don't order then.""
To make things worse, they were clearly understaffed, leading to delays and poor service. A brand like Domino's should prioritize transparency, proper billing, and customer service. Hope they take action to improve."
1,Delayed service‚Ä¶lethargic attitude. Old retro excuse less staff for delayed services. No provision for drinking water. I think domino‚Äôs not paying attention to this store.
1,"Hopeless airconditioner, all were not working, very hot inside restaurant, Hopeless staff, very bad experience in dominos, will not recommend to any person, zero rated, waiting time 45 minutes with ac not working g"
5,Best service in Mira Road
5,
3,Average food taste. The fish fry was good. Don't see the price menu uploaded in Google map it's too old
1,"My last two visits to your restaurant have been disappointing. Previously, the fish dish I ordered was overpowered by excessive garlic, masking its natural flavor. On my most recent visit with a large family group, the Rawas fish we ordered was unfortunately not fresh and fell short of expectations. It seems management may not be maintaining the high standards previously established, particularly in procuring quality fish for customer service"
5,"Reasonable, quick service, tasty food, fresh fish"
3,"Budgeted restaurant for Sea Food..

Nice small place with Quick service, u can get instant Thali of Fish, prawns etc..
Normal South Indian preparation.
You won't be disappointed nor be over whelmed with the taste.
All in All, ok experience."
5,"Food is amazing, quantity is the best in Calangute, you will be seated forever because they have only 2 waiters for the whole restaurant. Pros once order given you will get good in 15 mins.
I guess goa in general has missing basic etiquette of asking water to guests so I ain't blaming them."

4,"Pizza Hut is a well established multinational chain of restaurants that specialises in making some lip smacking Pizzas. One can rest assured about their quality of ingredients. Food packaging and delivery is also top notch.
We have ordered quite a few times now from this outlet and have never been disappointed..üòã"
1,"They took our order, prepared it and did not deliver. Then booked a porter and canceled. And then sent that same cold food after 2 hours. All this while, zero calls with us and their own number was switched off"
1,"Domino's outlet is better bro literally mosquito is everywhere it's like one extra member pls shut the outlet if u can't handle it
Even the staff member's are not co-operative they literally just ignore i don't even know what they are upto. 0% staff service. What y'all charge for ????? Atleast be kind to the customers"
2,"As a food blogger , I see the quality first specially when it is a brand . Now a days everyone make a almost good pizza. But if I take this brand then they have lowered their level. The service is very late above all those the quality is bad. The pizza bread was too chewy ,dusty and tasteless. The filling was too not that good  ( Veggies Pizza ) Thank God I din ordered Chicken. Not at all worthy . The price is quite high. Ambience is good ! But what to do about those ambience where food is not served properly . Taste level 2/10 . Very disappointed!"
5,"The best Chicken Crispy ever! Sweet & Spicy, Saucy and perfectly crispy. Chicken Lollypop and Cheese Garlic Naan was okay. Had Prawns Pulao and Chicken Seekh Biryani as well. But chicken crispy is what pulls my family there every time!"
3,"Visited the New Shahi restaurant which is on the MTNL road right opposite to Sanman Restaurant and Bar. We ordered Khichiya Masala Papad, Lollipop Masala Dry, Dal Khichdi Tadka and Paneer Satay. The food taste was OK and the service was good. The Shahi hotel right opposite to Bharat Petroleum has far more better taste than this one."
4,"I have been eating/ ordering food from here for a very long time and I can say the food is really very good. Their various chicken dishes are the best but personally I think the butter chicken is top notch. I have been to the restaurant as well. It's clean, the staff/ service is good and their price is reasonable. The restaurant has a/c and non a/c section. They do home delivery too.

Overall it's good and will recommend it üíØ"
4,"I have had the opportunity to dine here two times. The first time, i actually dined at the restaurant, and the second time, I we ordered take out. We ordered mughlai the first time, it was really delicious. The quantity was good and I was really satisfied with the service. The ambiance was also good. The second time, when we ordered take out, we ordered the Chicken Titanic, Mutton Do Pyaza, Chicken Tikka, Mutton Hyderabadi Biryani with Tandoori Roti. We thoroughly enjoyed these dishes, my only complain is that the quantity was lesser compared to what we would have gotten, had we dined at the restaurant itself. The dishes were really full of taste and we especially enjoyed the Chicken Titanic. However the mutton dishes were a bit of a letdown, because there were so many bones. We mostly only found bones in the mutton dishes than actual good pieces. Anyways, other than that, if you want a taste of real 'shahi' food, do visit this place. The food is mostly affordable for the quality they serve you. The service is good. Overall, a good experience!"
3,Food was good but not as before when it was too good tandoori was good gravy total waste of money so service waiters dont know what to recommend or what is diffrence between spicy n non spicy gravy worst service i have seen nor does he know the menu items himself very very bad service bit cramped up sitting space but its ok for service -10 stars
5,"Services are Very Good & Friendly
Dishes like Sea Foods and Tandoori item are Delicious"
5,"I have to give them 5 star... They provide extra ordinary service by giving 2 phone Charging point and charger on each table...

Food is much reasonable and tasty
Service is the best"
4,"Not a bad place at all. Infact, I was surprised to see that it was a quite bar compared to other in Mira road. The service was quick and tasty too. Even the alcohols were priced decent, and polite staff. Do not get your family here though. I would definitely visit them again."
4,Decent and value for money. Every table has a mobile charging connection. So while u drink and watch TV ur phone also can get charged simultaneously. Food takes time to be served.
5,their starters are overall good but it's a crowded and noisy area I'll not recommend this to couples or peace loving persons like me .
3,"Very hyped restaurant. They have amazing tandoor items. Other dishes were okay. Try not to order Chinese food items. Good for large groups.
They don‚Äôt have card payment option. Either UPI or cash which is inconvenient."
2,I ordered abc from zomato. The worst thing was the quantity. The biryani was only half and the kebab was also cut into two pieces. The kabab was completely dry. As if it was made hours ago. The price was 299.
5,"‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
I had an outstanding dining experience at Sigdi Restaurant! The non-vegetarian dishes were absolutely delicious and exceeded my expectations. The flavors were authentic and the presentation was top-notch. The variety of options available for non-vegetarians is impressive, catering to various tastes and preferences. The service was excellent, with attentive and friendly staff making the visit even more enjoyable. I would highly recommend Sigdi Restaurant for any non-vegetarian food enthusiast. Can‚Äôt wait to visit again and try more of their delectable offerings! üçΩÔ∏è"
5,"The taste of mughlai Food here just wow. The serve one of the best Mughlai, Chinese,  North Indian Food as it is prepared in authentic way. The Smoky and rich flavor is just wow. Do try their Chicken faham, Chicken dum biryani they are the best I had till now. The place is very clean with excellent service.  They have Arabian Style baithak, a must Visit place with family and friends in mira road."
5,It‚Äôs a nice place to visit with family & friends. It has a regular table seats as well as Arabic style low seating. The food is very nice & pocket friendly. You can see the tandoor & the preparation being done. Butter chicken biryani is a good option. Portions are decently served. Hygienic. Staff is polite.
1,"I had a very disappointing experience with my recent Zomato order. First, the restaurant delayed updating the app, claiming the food wasn‚Äôt available only after the order was placed. Then I received two separate calls informing me that different items were out of stock.

The communication was extremely poor throughout. I was told on a call that my food would be dispatched in 15 minutes, but 30 minutes later, the delivery rider called to say he was still waiting at the restaurant because the food hadn‚Äôt been prepared yet.

This kind of irresponsible and unprofessional behavior is unacceptable. It‚Äôs frustrating, especially when you‚Äôre left hungry and misled multiple times. I hope this issue is taken seriously and appropriate action is taken against the restaurant for their lack of service."
5,"I have lived in Mira Road for 9 years now and this place has been on my visit list each year...The ambience is good, decent crowd, superb food menu and very tasty food and most important they have very courteous and down to earth staff who will never disappoint it's customer.. Off Lately the restaurant has started with a live music performance by the musician who goes to each dining table and sings a song while playing his guitar.. Absolutely it's Timeless!!"
5,"Great place to go with family/ friends. The price and quantity of food is good. The bar menu is also budget friendly. There is usually a guy who comes with a guitar on Sundays, so you can enjoy your very own personal live music if you're lucky enough. The staff is polite and friendly. Overall a nice place with nice ambiance."
4,"Excellent destination for family or friends. There is good cuisine in both quantity and quality. If you're lucky enough, you can enjoy your very own live music‚Äîa guy frequently shows up on Saturdays with a guitar. The personnel is amiable and courteous. Nice location overall with a pleasant atmosphere. I kind of feel the prices are slightly high. Nevertheless, I would still adjust for a day for the good ambience"
3,The atmosphere was good . The food was also tasty. Service however was very slow. Food was brought and kept however due yo lack of servers it was lying around for quite some time
5,"I‚Äôve been eating at this place for like a year now and all of my taste buds are open whenever i eat at this place , the Italian salad and the spinach one is my favourite, plus it‚Äôs healthy and at such low rates. The food looks aesthetic af."
4,"I visited many times at Pro Diet Kitchen in Miraroad and had a wonderful experience. Their commitment to healthy eating is clear in their thoughtfully crafted menu, featuring a wide range of nutritious meals that are full of flavor. The portion sizes are generous, making it a great value for money.

The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, always eager to suggest dishes based on dietary preferences. I especially appreciated their meal prep options, which are perfect for those busy days. The ambiance is clean and inviting, though it‚Äôs worth noting that seating is quite limited, with only 2 or 3 chairs available for dining in.

Overall, Pro Diet Kitchen is an excellent choice for anyone wanting to maintain a healthy diet without sacrificing taste. I highly recommend it!"
1,"I had ordered from Zomato. Firstly, The food item sent was wrong. Second thing the rice was undercooked with no seasoning and cold food was sent as if it was stored and sent when order received. The veges were not cooked at all. Paneer was so dry. Pathetic experience"
5,"Ordered for a Paneer BBQ salad. Nice juicy and fresh. One serving is self sufficient. The vegetables are nice and fresh. The paneer was soft. It has a slight sweet taste, many may dislike. Severed in a nice container, well packed."
5,Have been eating alot from here ever since I've been watching my weight. Calories can be monitored at the same time food delivered is too delicious. Portion sizes are generous too.
3,"Overall a decent experience!!!

1,If u r coming here pls take a lot if time with you. 10 mins later a person came on we calling him to take order and food was 40 mins late on our table. Plus they are partial towards some customers. Food was cold as well as chicken wasn‚Äôt cooked. Consider before visiting.
1,Most hilarious! I walked in and ordered chicken mangolian at the cash counter. Moments later someone from the kitchen came to ask if my order was main course or starter. He said that he will get the order from another restaurant nearby. I immediately understood that the guy did not know his menu. So I changed the order to a regular chicken chilly. As I was waiting the same man came again to the cash counter and asked how is Hong Kong noodles made. The cashier tokd him 'peri peri sause dal ke bana do'. The chicken chilly that I got was over fried and chewy. I guess their chef quit the job suddenly!
1,"There's a reason it has a 3 rating... Guys, DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE! Period! Pathetic quality, oily, at least 40% coating. Ive added a pic of only the coating and oil... You'll suffer health issues before your order gets delivered. I tried the Prawns Tawa Fry but it was soaked in unhealthy oil and coating... Same with the Chicken Liver. Stale and unhealthy. Please don't waste your health here."
3,"They only serve Chinese after 2:30 nothing else.  I had jeera rice with chicken chilli. Quantity is very good,two person can adjust easily but quality of chicken chilli not too yummy. Its oky"
1,Not at all a cozy place. Lot's of mosquitoes and lizards as well. Would not recommend as the place is not at all hygiene.
5,Awesome restaurant in Mira road.. try bamboo biryani which is famous for
1,I found a cockroach I'm my veg fried rice yesterday which came in my daughter's plate I had already eaten 2 spoons of fried rice so did my wife I showed the staff the cockroach & advised him to my surprise he bought me a full bill no compensation in fact I had to tell  him to get the fried rice charge taken off which he wasn't willing to do after me yelling at him he then went back & deducted that charge . Never eat here it's kitchen is unhygienic which may make u sick
3,"I mostly prefer eating non-veg, so i tried few dishes. And i found it tasty, and they provide sea food also.
One should try this place, not big place to eat but you can order at home & enjoy your evening snacks or dinner."
3,"Food is good with normal embieance. Novice waiters. Serving time after order is about 20 to 25 min. If place gets crowded then your order serve is quick, if less crowd then order serve is at their on leisure time. Good place for Family."
1,"My experience at this shop was nothing short of a disappointment. The pastries I bought tasted stale and spoiled, leaving a bad taste in my mouth. Plus, they had the nerve to charge extra for a carry bag which is having their brand name, and it is illegal. They even didn't give me bill for the same. Save yourself the disappointment and find a better bakery."
1,Yesterday I got a cake from here. It was horrible. The chocolate topping was pathetic. The idea was to relive the old days as Monginis is one of the oldest cake makers and we use to have it all the time during our school days. Now I realised why people have stopped ordering cakes from Monginis. It sucks.
1,"We, my sister ordered rasmalai cake, it's taste was bitter and smell of medicine was coming. And now they are denying that this can not happen. We returned cake to them now they are not giving another cake or not returning money also. Worst experience"
1,"Worst place.... It place spoiled by birthday I have ordered a cake of heart shape beautiful heart design on it . And they have sent this worst cake with no proper packaging .
They have this cake which was no fresh at all . Cutting of cake was so difficult using that knife .No candle was given . No name was mentioned on the cake . The cake was very bad in taste .
No proper packaging and the number of monginis given was a incorrect num . Guys never take cake from here ."
5,"Had a lovely experience at Monginis Cake Shop, (Jangid Branch)
Have taken multiple time cakes for multiple occasions & Always have given me the best.
This one was a special one for my Fianc√© & my Family for Rose day celebration.
Also to mention Special thanks for making my engagement cake also special. It was the best.
Thanks for keeping us satisfied with cakes that we choose for our special occasions."
3,"I visited this restaurant a few weeks back. The space is cozy and small. The staff is pretty quick with their service and they‚Äôre friendly. We ordered a lot of dishes while some of them stood out the others just missed the mark

Masala papad (4/5)

This one clearly stood out for me. This is exactly what BBC is know for. The prawns were juicy and the masala tasted well.

Overall, the starters are good, but the biryani always stands out."
1,"I recently ordered Chicken Tikka Biryani from BBC and was disappointed. The biryani lacked flavor and did not come with a gravy layer, which made the rice very dry and difficult to eat. I hope they can improve on this in the future. It‚Äôs seems like naam bade aur Darshan Chhote. Very much disappointed."
4,"The ambience of the restaurant is good.
Food quality is also great but pricing could have been better its bit over priced but definitely recommended to visit once.
I liked the chicken lollipop and Chicken crispy most."
3,I have ordered one small size chicken biriyani and one big size chicken biriyani. If I say about the quantity of the biriyani then I must say it is less as per the price. Chicken size is okay. But the quantity of rice is less. In small size chicken was 2 pieces and in big size chicken was 4 pieces. As per taste it is not much good.  Earlier the taste was better. I didn't expect it. I thought it was the best brand in Mumbai for the biriyani.
4,I have ordered chicken biryani The biryani test is good. And quantity is also good.
1,"Today was my daughter birthday so i when to monginis to purchase the cake ...when i when home n cut the cake , The cake was very dry.... they are not ready replace it.... worst customer service"
1,I bought a birthday cake for my brother from this yesterday but it was not fresh maybe cake was kept there for more than a week . I was devastated because we were happily celebrating but ruin because i choose the worst cake for him . I hope this cake shop need to improve alot and not make your customers unhappy again.
3,"Nowadays monginis cakes are not like before.
The cake I get yesterday was not that great , it was too sweet.(cherry and chocolate ) cake

And also one thing , although shop was clean, the owner was eating gutka inside shop.

It was feeling very wierd as a seller only eating gutka in front of customers. Please look into matter"
2,"Never buy their milk made pastries. I bought rasmalai pastries, its was spoiled and smells very bad. You can't even ate it. I gave it to return to the shop and they are saying it's fresh even it was smelling very bad. We asked them to give different pastry and they directly declined and said pastry will send to the lab and blah blah. Their customer service is very pathetic. Always their cakes are not up to the standard."
1,Second time their product is not fresh got a donut this morning it's so hard can feel it is atleast 2 days old. Last time got a cake that was also not fresh. Monginis losing its brand due to their vendor
5,Nice hotel. Well hygienic. Moderate rate available here.
3,Food is fine....almost sweet all curries.....chicken peices are very less only grave they give....somewhere they ok in taste but not perfect....just using same gravy in all curries....they use oil aa lot...you can see .
1,"The worst hotel in mira road, hear you have to everything you have to wait 45 min after you place the order, food is like thay are giving to poor person and change of food is like 5 star ,it is better to eat in chaines restaurant near this hotel, my suggestion is never go to this hotel, i would give  -10 star for this hotel."
4,The food is good and service is quick . It's restaurant and not hotel
5,Awesome place to have a delicious taste of north Indian cuisine..
1,We had ordered 89 china town soup which was horrible and now the standard and quality of this restuarant is not good at all. Either they are changing the chef and staff every now and then due to which the taste keeps on changing . But this time it was worst when it came to hygiene issue. I would NVR visit this restaurant ever again . This was my last .Disappointing and bad service . Value for money is zero . Not worth it .
1,"Food is pathetic they serve more coated chicken skin and corn flour and less chicken meat in the name of chicken. Making people fool. They charge so high somewhat like mainland China but quality of food is disappointed. Atmosphere is like udupi restaurant very noisy. Seating arrangement is congested.
Service is ok.
But overall making people fool."
5,"The Food is Amazing, the staff is very friendly and helpful and if you're visiting this hotel I recommend you to try Chicken Noodle Thread Crispy it's delicious and you must try the chicken fried rice it's awesome too

They also offered us Pan shots(it's complementary) it was tasty too
Overall experience was amazing üî•"
5,"Awesome, i have ordered in past may times it was always good, always felt good quality food while eating it, today it was awesome, i deleted other 2 restaurants phone number from my phone from where i used to  order sometimes."
2,"The indoor seating is too small for like 15-20 people that too congested. The starters were good in veg and non veg both. But the main course we order was chi. chopper rice and veg fried rice which was terrible no taste the gravy that comes along was already mixed in it. The taste was so bad we didn't try other main course.
Earlier this outlet was good but not now."
4,"Apsara Ice Cream is a must-visit for anyone who loves unique and flavorful ice creams. Their range of flavors is impressive, from classic choices to more experimental ones, each crafted with quality ingredients. I tried their sitaphal (custard apple) and Guava Glory with a pinch of Red pepper, and both were absolutely delicious‚Äîrich, creamy, and full of authentic taste. The service is friendly, and the ambiance is casual yet inviting, perfect for a quick treat or a leisurely dessert outing. Definitely looking forward to trying more flavors on my next visit!"
5,"I prefer icecreams by Apsara more than Naturals. Over the years I noticed that Naturals icecreams have bits of ice pieces which spoil the taste and experience all together.

I have tried Belgian choclate icecream, guava with red chilli powder, mango, sitafal, Ferrero rocher, coconut, etc."
4,"Good variety of ice-cream. Unique flavours like Pani Puri etc! 2 double scoop cones and 1 single scoop cup cost us 260 rupees which is decent. Seating options include chairs, bean bags. Plays music. Clean interiors."
1,"The rating is for the SCAM offers they provide ONLINE. Their offers are cunning on Zomato and Swiggy. You buy at 50% discount and on payment page - they add the discounted amount showing as different charges. At the end, they take original price for their product. Beware of this SCAM guys."
5,"Definitely Recommended!!

Had an amazing experience. I usually check the Ice Cream Parlour by tasting the Vanilla first.
The Vanilla Vibes of Apsara was just too good. Had two family packs it was just amazing. Have tried other flavours as well and it didn't disappoint.
Staff is courteous as well.
Do visit it."
5,"On my sons 25th birthday, I wanted the rasmalai flavor cake exactly as per the 1st photo, and amazingly got the same created by Ribbons and Balloons. The test was awesome. Everyone at home enjoyed it. Thanks Ribbons and balloons for making my sons birthday awesome."
5,"Excellent Service Ribbons and Ballon Bhayender

Since Mira Road R and B is shut down found Bhayender Ribbons and Ballon

Last year ordered cake from some other cake shop it was disaster so I didn't want to take chances with looks and taste of cake so opted back r and b shop

Vishal was awesome with his services and kept on giving suggestions how we can make cake taste and look better.

Finally got what I needed best place to get your cake customised. As you guys know memories matter and birthdays won't return daily so get best what needed.

And this store is excellent

Thanks alot"
5,R&B is the one stop shop we count for cakes... Since last 4 years we are ordering from same brand and no doubt their taste are as good as was on first birthday order...
5,I had taken chocolate brownie fudge cake for on her bday it was extremely mesmerizing and yummy with loads of nuts and chocolate and softness of brownie highly recommended
5,Service is top notch . And red velvet is a must try.
5,"I have been going to this place from a decade now and their food is always superb. Not once have I been disappointed. The place is hygienic, service is excellent and taste is absolutely spot on every visit. I have already recommended this to my friends and family multiple times. My favourite dishes include Wanton soup, chicken satay and mixed sizzler."
5,"Food quality- still amazing, I came back after 5 years and was craving for Chinese and recollected this restaurant, not sure how but they have managed to maintain the taste, quality and quantity exactly the same maintaining high standards of hygiene.
Service staff is quite attentive and focused.
Great experience
Ambiance- they have redone their interiors from what I had seen 5yrs ago and they have enhanced it quite cosy and family friendly.
Got the meet one of the oldest staff whom I have been seeming since 20+years
Thanks for the amazing Prawn Sizzler
Good enough for 2 people."
1,"Visited Pink Dragon with my family and it was an awfully bad experience we had. We ordered Shanghai Mushroom, Chicken Chilli and Veg Manchurian Fried Rice. All the dishes taste like roadside chinese stalls. The service is very average, not slow but not good also. The prices are also high compared to other Chinese corners. Wasted my ‚Çπ1200 here. The only good thing is their ambience. I don't know if I'll be visiting this place again in the future."
1,"I ordered chicken hot pot from this restaurant through Swiggy.
What I received was absolutely not worth the food .
Hot pot supposed to be rice and gravy but as per the restaurant recepie they do not serve gravy.
Below are the actual photo of the food what I received from Swiggy and the phot what is posted on the Swiggy app.
The food does not worth what I paid for."
4,"Famous for Indo style Chinese food
Manchow soup was good
Lollipop was the only dish was good must try
Sizzlers simply expensive no worth for money
Noodles was ok ok
Never try fried rice, really bad experience"

5,Homely Tasty Food but you really want to enjoy you have to reach at 1 pm for lunch or 7:30 pm for Dinner. As they cook fresh therefore during later hours food does not last. Surely! an awesome homely food Go to PLACE
5,Very delicious food...
5,"This is a small restaurant but the taste of food is awesome. It reminds you typically homemade food. If you are fond of very taste of Rajasthan spicy food, this is a perfect place. The cost is also very reasonable. Good for regularly eating outside away from home. Must go place."
1,"Overpriced and quality of food average
Not recommended"
1,The food quality is worst. Got bad experience in quality of the food. Posting this review post 3 bad experiences . Avoid this place.
5,"Best outlet of Barbeque nation in south mumbai.
Excellent food quality, food options, and desserts. Service by all staff is extraordinary and very prompt.
Ms. Sumitra is very prompt and professional in her service , she‚Äôs is very polite and dedicated. She attended our family from start till end with utmost professionalism.
Highly satisfied with her services.
Do give a try here and enjoy your special moments."
2,"I visited Barbeque Nation for the first time with 21 office colleagues. While the staff was friendly and the ambience was nice, I was disappointed with the food. The prawns were chewy, and the barbeque items burned quickly, making them hard to enjoy. I was so let down that I didn't even try the main course. The only thing I liked was the brownie in the dessert section. Overall, the food was just okay. I don't think I'll come back."
5,"Mother‚Äôs Day Lunch at Barbeque Nation ‚Äì Atria Mall

We celebrated Mother's Day with a delightful lunch at Barbeque Nation, Atria Mall, and were truly impressed. The food was excellent ,both the veg and non-veg starters were fresh and flavourful. Personal favourites included the perfectly grilled pineapple, succulent chicken, juicy prawns, and the rich, aromatic mutton gravy. The salad counter offered a vibrant spread, with the raw mango salad standing out as a zesty treat.

The only drawback was the low cooling ‚Äì the centralized air conditioning needs improvement to enhance the overall comfort.

However, what truly made our visit special was the outstanding service. A special mention to Anand, who was incredibly efficient and attentive. From refilling water and starters to promptly providing tissues, his dedication and focus on customer satisfaction were evident. His honest and hardworking approach made our experience memorable.

We visited especially for the seasonal mango additions. While the desserts were enjoyable, adding a few tangy dips to complement the starters could elevate the experience even further.

Overall, a wonderful celebration made extra special by the team at Barbeque Nation. Rating: 8/10.

Thank you for making Mother's Day a cherished one!"
1,"I recently visited Barbecue Nation in Worli and was extremely disappointed with the experience. We had booked a table for 10:00 PM, expecting a smooth and enjoyable evening. However, upon arrival, we found ourselves waiting for an extended period. The table we were eventually given at 10:30 PM hadn't even been cleared from the previous guests.

It was frustrating to see that, despite our reservation, there was no readiness or effort to accommodate us promptly. By the time the table was finally cleared, it was already 11:10 PM. This kind of service is unacceptable and left us with a very bad overall experience. I wouldn't recommend this location based on my visit."
1,"We recently visited Barbeque Nation at Atrium Mall in Worli for a Diwali team lunch with a group of 30 people, hoping to celebrate with good food and a festive atmosphere. Unfortunately, our experience was far from enjoyable.

The restaurant was uncomfortably hot, and it felt as if the air conditioning was barely functioning. We asked the staff multiple times to adjust the temperature, but despite their assurances, nothing improved. Many of us felt increasingly suffocated, and the heat became overwhelming to the point where we felt lightheaded and could barely enjoy the food.

Speaking of food, the quality didn‚Äôt meet our expectations either. Some items seemed bland, and we barely touched the main course due to the overall discomfort we were experiencing. The uncomfortable atmosphere overshadowed any chance we had to appreciate the food and socialize.

Given our experience, I would not recommend this location for corporate lunches or dinners. The lack of proper climate control, despite repeated requests, combined with subpar food, left our team disappointed. If you‚Äôre planning a large group gathering, I suggest looking elsewhere for a more comfortable and enjoyable experience."
4,
5,Might be the best tika masala in my life. For real. I highly suggest the chicken tika and the chicken fried rice. Unreal flavors
4,"Recently I had a basic chicken kepsa and trust me it was all loaded with flavours...
It was so well garnished and presented to us...
Just a perfect kepsa, if you are a group of 4 to 5 who it's a perfect option for you.
Must try"
4,It's a very average restaurant for who want some quick light bite. Though you will get common non-neg Chinese dishes but i will not recommend this for family outing. Very affordable and taste is also good. If you are very hungry and want some spicy non-veg Chinese food at affordable price then go for it !!!  **NON AC**
4,"This is a very prime place for food so it gets a bit crowded at lunch time, Muslim community runs this restaurant but they don't serve beef here, full meal at reasonable prices. They serve veg & non veg both , great sweet dish here is matka rabadi,
Location jecob circle (satrasta) , special menu made  for daily  specially in Ramadan days , overall good restaurants,not recommended for dating point of view"
5,"The food is great if you are looking for the local down to earth feel of food. The staff are ever ready to help and the owner is so friendly and helpful, and suggestions are a part of his conversation. Was extremely pleased to visit the outlet after years. They still haven't changed and have lived upto their values. Strong recommendation to try it out."
5,"Had ordered chicken tomkha soup, chicken manchow soup and chicken basil pot rice. Finger licking taste, sufficient quantity. Loved the restaurant"
5,"Well i Ordered Chicken Fried rice  From Zomato..Well i Cant Express in Words That it was so Delicious That I want To visit this Restaurant and eat there.The sauce,And Egg..everything was Well ServedüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
2,"I was looking for a Chinese restaurant on Foodpanda and found the listing of this one. Place is very close to my house according to the location on maps but I have never seen it or been there, probably becuae it is new. Online menu had multiple options but I Ordered Chicken chilly and Chicken schezwan.

Chicken chilly: It had long pieces of chicken inside. Chicken was well cooked and flavor was good. 3/5 on taste. Quantity was good.

Chicken schezwan: This one was with gravy, chicken was tender just like chicken chilly but the taste was not that good. 2.5/5 on taste.

A decent restaurant to eat Indian Chinese food but don‚Äôt try it unless you do not have an alternate option."
4,Ther are to much crowd. Food is to good I love it
1,The place was closed and phone not reachable so I couldn't review
4,"This restaurant provides Punjabi, South Indian  food. They also serve Pav Bhaji and Thalis as well. It is near the Byculla railway station on the East side. Overall the food tastes good and food arrives quickly once the order is placed. Good place for family."
4,"Great place. I went there almost everyday for breakfast and dinner. Nice location close to many buses and the Bayculla train station. Staff is friendly, with exception of one waiter. The food is good and reasonably priced. Average 80 rupees for breakfast and 120 for dinner. The sauces on the side are great. Rice is extra price if you want, I usually skipped. A lot of locals come here for tea and breakfast. Not vegan at all but a good veg place. Big and cozy as well. A/C available upstairs."
5,"This place is located across Byculla railway station. While historically (15-20 yrs ago) they use to mainly serve south indian food only, however, with changing times they now server snacks like sandwiches and chaats all of which is of good taste and good quality.

The service was warm and food served was fresh and quick.

We have also ordered food from this place few times and have never been disappointed.

Overall a good place for a quick meal serving quality food, good variety and which is also pocket friendly."
4,"An authentic pure veg South Indian restaurant with just a 2 minute walk from the Byculla Railway Station. Spacious enough with AC family dining upstairs. The tables and surroundings were clean and they have two washbasins too.
Variety of options to choose from such as pav bhaji, veg thali, South Indian dishes, chole bhature and many more.
We had,
Pav bhaji - tastes the usual you eat anywhere.
Idli Sambar, Mysore Masala Dosa - Sambar was a bit sweet (every authentic South Indian restaurant do have their sambar a bit sweet).
It isn't very expensive and the service was up to mark."
4,"Just opposite to Byculla station we can find this restaurant. A very calm ambience even though its in the midst of a busy street. Food is good, the service is good. They present their food really well."
5,"Visited Persian Darbar, Byculla branch over the weekend for dinner, and it was an unforgettable experience.

We arrived early around 7 PM, so we easily got a table without any wait.

Starters/ Mains:
‚Ä¢	The Mutton Paya Soup was absolutely delicious, rich, and flavorful.
‚Ä¢	The Mutton Raan Tandoori (Dry) was the highlight of the evening‚Äîmelt-in-the-mouth deliciousness that left us wondering how it could be so tender and flavorful.
‚Ä¢	The Chicken Starter Platter had an amazing variety and tasted fantastic.
‚Ä¢	The Mutton Roast was another stellar dish‚Äîperfectly cooked and bursting with flavor.
‚Ä¢	The Half Kepsa Biryani came with mutton chops and biryani-style rice. The portion was massive, and the taste was incredible.
‚Ä¢	The Mutton Yakhni Pulao was also very good‚Äîrich and satisfying.

Desserts:
We ended with desserts that stole the show.
‚Ä¢	The Baklawa, served with vanilla ice cream, was heavenly‚Äîprobably the best I‚Äôve ever had.
‚Ä¢	The Kunafa, with its sugary syrup and cheesy middle, was divine. We couldn‚Äôt stop licking our fingers!

Ambiance and Service:
The interior is nothing short of royal, with a Mughal palace-like vibe. Intricate chandeliers and beautifully designed walls add to the grandeur. The place is massive and can accommodate large groups easily.

The staff was incredibly courteous and went above and beyond to make our evening special. They suggested the best dishes, clicked wonderful photos for us, and ensured we had a memorable time.

Though it‚Äôs a bit pricey, the quality, quantity, and experience make it worth every penny. We loved the desserts so much that many of us packed extra to enjoy the next day.

Highly recommended for a royal dining experience and delicious food!"
1,"The food quality has declined compared to before, and the biryani is not as good as it used to be. The service has also deteriorated,I experienced a one-hour delay in serving food, only to be informed later that they had run out of roti and offered chapati as a substitute. This wasn‚Äôt just my experience; at a nearby table, they served cold biryani after an hour-long wait. Additionally,  i experienced at another outlet that they served biryani that wasn‚Äôt fresh, with a noticeably smaller portion of chicken."
5,"Exceptional dining The ambiance was elegant and intimate, with a warm atmosphere that immediately made us feel welcome. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and provided outstanding service throughout our meal
The food was phenomenal triggered our taste buds."
5,"Amazing Nonveg food. Their services are topnotch.
The quality and taste of their food are superb.
I tried chicken Tikka Biryani and Kunafa.
Kunafa is a must Try."
5,Must try mutton dal ghosh and persian special chicken kepsa. Perisan special kepsa serve with chicken gravy. Overall atmosphere is awesome.
5,"It was an experience. We took the 10 course meal and I must say it was great! The presentation of Indian ingredients in a modern style was amazing. Each dish was on par with the other ones and were unique. Desserts were slightly sub par as compared to the other dishes, but still great! Letting us into the kitchen and tasting a dish there, was a good touch and added to the overall experience. We had a vegetarian menu. They do take the dietary restrictions into consideration, so make sure you let them know in advance!
I‚Äôll highly recommend taking this experience. Tip: come empty stomach because the 10 course meal is going to make you full!!"
5,"An amazingly well curated and delicious 10 course meal.
Superb plating. Very well explained.
Thoughtful touches of a mini cake and hot chocolate pre-mix just added to the entire experience
A must must go!"
5,"Flawlessly executed fine dining - this is the most impressed we've been by a meal for a long time! Every single dish in the tasting menu was beautifully presented, flavourful and unique - we loved the pork, crab and lamb dishes in particular ! Portions were perfect - we left feeling full and very satisfied. The service was impeccable - extraordinarily attentive and professional, and every dish and wine pairing was well explained. We had both the international and the homegrown wine matches and loved both - we were especially blown away by how good the Indian wine matches were, so we would highly recommend trying it! The ambience was chic and understated, with excellent music choice throughout the evening. There were lots of other lovely little touches like the visit to the kitchen. We also appreciated the Polaroid photo to take home. Overall a fantastic experience which justifies the price. A big thank you to the wonderful team at Masque - we hope to return someday!"
3,"The tasting menu had plenty of options and featured locally sourced ingredients, which was cool. While the dishes were creative, the flavors felt a bit off‚Äîleaning more toward American/European tastes than truly capturing the essence of contemporary Indian cuisine. Overall, it‚Äôs worth trying once for the unique vibe and great drinks."
3,"The service and atmosphere are impeccable - with small touches that are unique and make the night memorable. The only let down is the food itself which is such a shame - the dishes just lacked some flavour - the lamb needed more salt for example (small but significant fix) and was very sweet - it needed spice or sour to break it up a bit. Other dishes were just a bit bland - very stylish and unique but bland, like the crab dish needed lemon or garlic.

Also my husband had the cocktail pairing menu which he loved. I am intolerant to many fruits so ordered two separate mocktails - these cost the same as his six! It would have been better if they had done the tasting menu for me with the fruits I can have - or charged less for a non alcoholic drink. Also, we ordered one bottle water (which is 700 rupees) and they kept pouring so we had two - so we ended up spending 55 gbp or 5500 rupees on juice and water - as non drinkers. I understand it is a fine establishment but this felt a bit much with added service and tax almost 60 pounds feels ridiculous. Other fine dining places we have visited are half the price and double the flavour."
1,"I'm writing to express disappointment with my recent order from the Byculla branch. I ordered a 2-portion Chicken Taco, & 2 mediums cheese burst margarita pizza but received a taco with a meatball instead of chicken. This is unacceptable, especially since my family has allergies to meatballs.

When my wife took a bite, she discovered the mistake. We've always trusted the Dominos brand, and this experience has shaken that trust. The incorrect delivery ruined our family gathering. & the order was totally cold its not in condition to eat you guys are spoiling the brand image & brand reputation

I've attached a video for reference. I request a full refund and expect immediate action. Due to this poor experience, I'm unlikely to order from Dominos again."
1,"Useless service ever got at dominos
The pepperoni garlic bread was without cheese
All 4 of them
And after raising concerns they told they can give solution after 24 hrs what the hell is this behaviour.
And also the store manger doesn‚Äôt pick calls his number is off
I wasted 1300 rs on my order which was not even upto the mark and missing items .
And they gave the burger in lava cake box which didn‚Äôt had fillings at all
And also raw . First time such thing happened ."
1,Worst Garlic Cheesiken Rice ever eaten. Can‚Äôt believe dominos just dropped their standards. Was a mistake trying something new.
4,"I recently visited the Domino's Pizza outlet on Sant Savata Marg in Mumbai, and overall, my experience was quite enjoyable. The restaurant has a welcoming atmosphere, with a clean and well-organized dining area that makes it a comfortable spot to enjoy a meal with friends or family.

The menu offers a wide variety of pizzas, sides, and beverages, catering to different tastes and preferences. I decided to try their classic Margherita pizza along with some garlic bread, and I was pleased with the quality. The pizza had a deliciously crispy crust, generous toppings, and a flavorful tomato sauce that made each bite satisfying. The garlic bread was also a hit, perfectly toasted and packed with flavor.

The staff at this location were friendly and attentive, which added to the overall positive experience. They were quick to take our order and offered helpful recommendations from the menu.

However, one significant drawback was the wait time for dine-in orders. Despite the restaurant not being overly crowded during my visit, it took almost 40-45 minutes for our food to arrive. This was quite disappointing, especially since we were eager to dig into our meal. It would be beneficial for the management to streamline their kitchen operations to reduce wait times for customers.

In conclusion, while the food quality and service were commendable at Domino's Pizza on Sant Savata Marg, the lengthy wait time for dine-in orders is a notable area for improvement. If you're willing to be patient, you'll be rewarded with tasty pizza, but it's something to keep in mind if you're looking for a quick meal. Overall, I would still recommend this location for its delicious offerings but suggest visiting during off-peak hours to minimize wait times."
1,"I am very disappointed with the experience I had with Dominos. I placed an order for pizza at 10 PM, and receive a call at 12:10 AM from someone named Peter informing me, with an appalling attitude, that the order was cancelled. If your platform cannot cater to late-night delivery orders, you should close the delivery slots instead of keeping customers waiting for hours. Hiring people like Peter, who clearly lack basic customer service skills, is damaging your reputation. I suggest you review your hiring process and train your staff to handle situations courteously and responsibly. Or else there are many other alternatives that offers better service and respect to the customers."

Feel and vibe wise it's a decent place. Got good variety of alcohol at decent prices.

Have some offer so must look for those. Note they have two sections Ac and non Ac.

Overall great experience and great food with good drinks."
4,"Went here on Sunday afternoon, the ambience was very nice with the live music it was perfect for a lunch date.
Occupancy was 40% so got the order quickly. The staff were polite and friendly.
Ordered Burnt Chilli Garlic fried rice as it was shown as best seller on Zomato but it was not that great like 5/10"
5,"Ambience:
A vintage rustic interior. If you're here for lunch,you'll notice direct light from the roof which is quite sensible directed on ur table to give a touch of nature.
This rustic interior is complimented by live performances and music which makes it a perfect place for a date or an outing with ur bunch of friends. Its lively and happening.

Food:
The quality of ingredients and the sense of flavours in the dishes prepared are fantastic and upto the mark.
Must try dishes are Kuber Kulcha,Corn Curd,and Malaysian Sambal curry.

Service:
The food service is kinda slow but the the staff team is polite and helpful.

Price:
Surprisingly the food compared to the price they charge is quite low.
It'll be worth the experience."
3,"Food was great specially crunchy Lotus stem.
The only disappointment was mutton galauti kebab and LIIT.
Do not order LIIT from here, it will be mix of random juices with very less alcohol quantity. It will only fill your tummy up"

Amazing plating and presentation.

The paw bhaji fondue, and dessert were the highlights.

Their Beverages were too sweet or too spicy."
4,Food and service and atmosphere is very good but chineese not available only indian food available and food is tasty
1,"The worst place i have ever visited. I have never regretted a visit to new place , but this is the one place which I will regret for the rest of my life.

Starter was cold like ice. Main course was tasteless and pathetic, I would strongly say don't visit there its complete waste of money and time.

Service was icing on the cake, we had to wait for like half and hour just to get finger bowl and then again 20 min to get bill that to after visiting counter

The place does not even serve food it's like they are dumping food on the table."
3,"The atmosphere is definitely classy‚Äîa nice rooftop spot with a proper dining experience, great for a date. But the food? A complete letdown. The quantity doesn‚Äôt justify the price at all, and the taste was downright disappointing‚Äîfelt like street food at a premium price. Service was okay, presentation was decent but nothing special, and the cocktails were just average. Chicken skewers sucked."
3,"I booked a reservation through the EazyDiner app for a restaurant located on the 38th floor of the St. Regis Hotel in Lower Parel. The ambiance was very relaxing, with no intrusive music, allowing us to fully enjoy the stunning skyline views. We ordered only vegetarian dishes, and everything were okay. The staff was courteous and attentive."
4,"Awesome skyline view! Good Food and drinks, a bit on the higher side, however for the ambience, one would not mind paying the same."
3,"A nice roof top bar with great views across the city, however the smell of smoke is very strong.
The menu is reasonably priced and the food portion sizes are large. We ordered three dishes initially, the lotus stem, the burrata flatbread and the broccoli. The last dish had a weird taste so we had to cancel it, they made a bit of a fast but eventually agreed."
3,"Been to Asilo last 4 days back. Ambience is good but food not that great. Salmon  üç£ was not fresh. We tried making the reservation a day before but the lady on phone asked us to come directly as it‚Äôs already booked. After reaching there, all window seats were reserved and only 3 high table chair seats were available. Without given any choice we sat there but latter few 4 ladies arrived, they too were denied to sit near the window but latter were given to sit near the window as they were willing to walk away. It‚Äôs kind of unfair. People come to these kind of restaurants to enjoy the view and the rooftop beauty but these staff try to put stain on their enjoyment. (One more customer has shared similar experience on Google review). It‚Äôs ok to visit once."

4,"Great place to enjoy some burgers and unlimited coke. The place has good place to sit and is well lit. It serves portions that are value for money and good taste. Although you won't be able to have that Indian feel in the dish - but would suggest the chicken wings and the burgers. Disappointment was the soup and really bad table service, but they got saved by great chicken burgers and salmon fish. One star less because the waiter was little too busy to take care of us"
4,"The place serves authentic american fast food. Chicken wings lacked meat but was excellent on the taste buds. Pasta was at par with what you would expect and will definitely serve 2-3 people. The show stopper was the fish, beautifully cooked with mild flavour and a soothing feel to my pallet. The ending with dessert was superb and made a great end all together. It would cost approx 500-800 per person."
5,"It is a great place for American and Mexican food. Its specialty especially in veg is Chipotle Bowl, Tacos and Quesadillas. Flatbread pizza is good though. Pasta may seem to lack a bit of liquid sauce or oil but I guess can be managed upon request. In first glance of the menu, it may seem expensive but considering the quantity and quality you get, it is appropriate. Honestly speaking there are 40% Veg options and 60% Non-veg options but that shouldn't be a problem. You dig deep into the tightly packed menu and you can find whatever you need. It is good that the serving time is not too long. Do not that the Tacos are a little big in size then usual."
4,Delicious food sevred by friendly and helpful staff. Miss Pooja took very good care of our request. Coming to the food we order for Texas Spicy Chicken Wings which was awesome  then we order for 2 drinks which was ok. The thing which we all like the most was a burger Sunrise Burger with bacon and chicken patty. For main course we ordered for Quesadilla. The dessert could have been much better but over all we liked the place and surely gonna go back to try their chefs cut manu....
5,"I have ordered,

Chicken teriyaki shawarma, chicken nuggets salad and chicken nugget roll from here.

The taste of the shawarma was good. The quality of the chicken they have used was fresh and the taste of the chicken nugget salad was very much good. It was creamy and they have freshly prepared, good numbers of chicken nuggets they have added, loved the portion of the salad.

Chicken Nugget roll was very well cooked. Lots of veggies like, carrot, beetroot, and many healthy things were filled in it. The taste was excellent.

If you are looking for a healthy meals or healthy food. Falafels is the best delivery kitchen which is located in mahakali.

Although they have done very well food packaging. Spill proof packing they have did.

Delivery was on time and delivery boy had worn mask and gloves for safety.

All over experience with falafels was good and fantastic."
5,"This falafel outlet served us with the most craving dishes even during this pandemic.
No compromise on quality and quantity.
Excellent!
Late evening we ordered few recommended shwarma and Nachos, we were very happy to eat and still feel the taste in mouth.
Grande Nachos : Superb Crisp Corn chips with various combination of sauce added , also garlic mayo dip added
Firecracker Chicken Shawarma: BBQ chicken with tangy sauces and loads of hummus , highly recommended dish
Chicken Classic Shawarma : stuffed chicken with hummus and spicy sauces another superb dish which will be recommended.
To sum it up this outlet is serving some good mouthwatering wraps Shawarma Nachos and their regular dishes.
I would recommend to try atleast once and become a regular of this place.
Very well done , thank you for delicious delicacies."
4,"I tried chicken nuggets ,wraps and chicken platter.They served it with veg salad and yummy dips . Overall experience was good."
4,"Good Lebanese food, staff is very helpful in helping you identify the right mix of bread , humus, sauces as  per your taste.
Good combination of menu for falafel, Lebanese nachos, pita bread.
Try out the ginger lemon juice
Also the fudge punch, delicious !!!!"
4,"Falafel's serves lebanese food items like Shawarma, hummus, falafel , mediterranean rice and salads.
Shawarma is basically a thinly sliced cuts of meat( In this case Paneer) rolled into a large piece of flatbread or¬†pita¬†that has been steamed or heated."
4,"I remember coming here as a child very often with my parents to eat shawarmas. So when it reopened we had to come check it out.
We ordered a chicken shawarma and a mutton seekh roll. The mutton seekh roll was fantastic!! It was really so nice and with the green chutney it was even better. However, the chicken shawarma was nice but there was too much mayonnaise for my liking, maybe you can ask them to reduce it? But I highly recommend trying their rolls.

Also, service was pretty fast and even though they have less seating, we managed to get a table in 5-7 minutes"
4,"Tried Maroosh Lower Parel recently. Located near High Street phoenix on the way towards Palladium. It's a small joint but quite popular chain especially for a quick bite or take away. They have few small tables laid out. Specialise in Lebanese menu but interesting choice of rolls, kebabs, shawarma, falafels, pita bread and humus. Good veg options in mushroom, paneer. Tasty food and quick service also value for money."
5,"I recently visited Maroosh in Palladium Lower Parel and it was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the overall experience. The restaurant had a cozy and inviting atmosphere, and the staff were friendly and attentive. I ordered several dishes, including Smokey Garlic Hummus, Classic Chicken Shawarma And Smokey Butter Chicken.

The hummus was creamy and flavorful and in Classic Chicken Shawarma the chicken was tender and juicy, with a slightly crispy exterior that added texture to the wrap. The shawarma was packed with fresh vegetables along with a flavorful garlic sauce that added a delicious tangy kick. The wrap itself was warm and soft, and held everything together nicely. Overall, I would highly recommend. The chicken shawarma to anyone who enjoys Mediterranean cuisine.

Butter Chicken had a perfect balance of spices and sweetness, and the aroma alone was enough to make my mouth watering.

Overall, I would highly recommend this Mediterranean restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious and authentic dining or Take away experience.
It's definitely worth a visit.

P.S : The review is strictly depends on my personal experience."
5,"I went there for lunch with my husband‚Ä¶ The experience is pretty good with the food and the way we were attended by the staff there.. 5/5 for hospitality.. Food is pretty good.. the pita bread with hummus was served warm that actually enhances the taste of hummus
The place is well known for its wrap and shawarmas and i will say that‚Äôs actually right.. we are vegetarian so i can only write here about veg options..
Do try their bhuna paneer wrap its mind blowing.. my taste buds went blown with its taste.. loved it"
4,"Maroosh is a very tasty and healthy option than a burger. This store is located in high street next to MOD. They have a variety of wraps. My personal favorite is falafel hummus roll. They have good taste and they also put salad, sauces and the tikki or falafel. It is very tasty. Mast try. It is a bit expensive but u will be satisfied."
4,"Hello there,

So today we went to check this place out I'd heard a lot about this place but never really had a chance to visit.

Let's begin with the ambience here, the ambience had a different fun vibe it was a really Gothic location and the background really did look creative. The simple yet close to perfect decorations was all so good.

Coming to the servicing the hygiene was the upmost important thing they took care of also the staff members were really friendly along with the wonderful manager who took care that everything was well and good.

The food we ordered there was corn cheese poppers, chilly chicken, pizza they were all so scrumptious with just the right amount of spices needed the presentation really added the extra marks on it it looked so appetizing.

Coming to mocktails we ordered a fruit punch and blackcurrant slushie they were both so tasty! The quality and quantity was so good to the price. The cocktails ordered were the creamy sabritini and kamikaze they were again so wonderfully made and had a really good quantity.

Overall the we had a great time there and would love to visit this place over and over again!"
4,"This place is located in Pheonix mall , Hideout has beautifull ambience from the bar section to the beautifull graffiti on the wall this place has some amazing beautifully painted walls and a decent place which can host some good amount of people.
The only issue with this place was slow service, the things we ordered took almost half n hour to get it delivered .The crowd lately increases by time and the staff takes alot of time to deliver food from thirty to forty five min for even a mocktail.
The things we ordered goes like his

üî∫Mocktails üîª
üîπFruit Punch - it's served beautifully , taste is really good ,fruit punch is milk based and you can get the taste of apple and some fruit minute pieces inside , it was really a good mocktail they had to offer in their list .

üî∏Litchi and lemon - a good blend of Litchi and lemon really they did go well together and tasted really great together i would recommend it if you love litchi or lemon.

üîπ Flavoured Lemonade Blueberry - This was also good in taste like flavoured lemonade having blueberry taste to lift it up totally did justice to the lemonade ,must try it out .

üî∏Slushies - truly beautiful something which really looked good in presentation section , the semi blue and semi white Slushy part (ice) really looked beautiful to eyes ,the taste was also wonderful with berries striking in your mouth after some sips , really a good one Highly recommend this for a Mocktail lover out at this place .

üîª Appetizers / MCüî∫
üî∏ Sizzling Lemon chicken - A perfect sizzler with some rice , veggies boiled and chicken steak two pieces which are garnished with some black pepper, I will only suggest that they reduce the black pepper quantity a bit , the veggies were cooked well , baby corn , brocolli were there in the sizzler ,sizzler is something you can really opt for and try without a doubt.

üîπChicken Bhuna Canape- Chicken Bhuna canape had very small quantity like canape were good in taste ,seemed quite similar to butter chicken on a canape .I only wish if they had some good quantity to offer in it.

üî∏Chicken Garlic Finger- Chicken Garlic Finger is something anyone can try out .I highly recommend it , small pieces of chicken garnished with some cheese and it was good blend of garlic and chicken.

üîπ Barbeque Potatoes- Barbeque potatoes took a lot of time to get them deliver this almost 45 mins along the the pizza , but baby potatoes with the skin served in bbq service the quantity was good and so was the taste a veggie lover can surely opt for this.

üî∏ Barbeque Chicken Pizza- chicken pizza with thin base and honestly it could be a bit better there was nothing great in the pizza as I found the base thin but it was having few pieces hardly one on one slice of the pizza and the crust could be a lil more cooked otherwise everything was fine .

The ambience is beautiful with graffiti on the wall the place has some good sound system in the house ,which increases as the night turns up üòä, the Mocktails are good over here if you want to try them out , I would recommend chicken garlic finger as the quantity is also good .Fruit punch in mocktail is also very good , otherwise they only need to improve their service speed that's all.

Ambience -4.5/5
Food - 4/5
Service -3.5/5
Overall - 4/5"
5,"Hideout Cafe and Bar is a happening place in High Street Phoenix, true to its name. The low ceilings, cool graffitis and pipeline props make it look like an underground hideout. They have a bar section and also a proper seating section.
Post 10pm, the place gets a groovy vibe with dimmed lights and some amazing, amazing music. Their playlist curator has some really good taste in music. We couldn't stop ourselves from dancing our hearts out!
Here's a summary of what you should order-

Cocktails

Watermelon Martini: Refreshing concoction of watermelon and vodka. A light, pretty drink.

Demerara Toffee Apple Mojito: This one stole the show. White rum blended with demerara toffee brown sugar, apple juice and fresh mint. Delicious and pleasantly strong.

Fruit Margarita: We ordered one in Black currant flavour. Loved the colour. You can choose among strawberry, kiwi, litchi, etc.

LIIT Masala Maar Ke: Basic LIIT with twist of masala. Goes well with food.

Food

Cheese Corn Balls: Must have here. The balls are super crispy and adequately cheesy inside. Topped with even more cheese and mayo.

Chicken Bhuna Canape: Crispy tart topped with roasted masala chicken and cheese. Perfect finger food to go with drinks.

Hideout Special Hummus: Tasted good, though a little grainy. Came with little chicken pieces which added to the taste.

Chicken Keema Pav: Mutton keema was out of stock, so settled for this. Wasn't disappointed at all. One of the best keema I've tasted. So juicy, yet not at all oily. The buns were a bit too hard though.

Chicken Tikka Pizza: We called for an add-on of veggies in this one. Loved it. So crispy and favourful. One of the best things on the menu here.

Grilled Piri Piri Chicken: Smoky grilled chicken breast drizzled with piri piri sauce came with a side of veggies and french fries. Everything was so perfect. Fries were hot and crispy. Loved the whole dish, go for it.

Dishes take a while to arrive, however staff is polite and know the menu well. I'd have given a 4.5 rating, but due to lack of option, I'll give 5. Pretty awesome place in SoBo to chill over food and drinks, go and see for yourself!"
4,"This cafe is located inside the High Street Phoenix, Lower parel,
I love this restaurant,
the vibes of this restaurant is really groovy, your every buck spent here will be worth it. üòç

The staff here is no ordinary either,
not dressed up as casual restaurant waiters,
gives a friendly vibe and their service is also good and fast.

One more thing that I'd like to add, the guy who's in charge of the music department has some serious good taste.
Played some really good music which made me really groovy while having such good food.

Let's talk about food and drinks

Cocktail

(1) Dirty Italian Martini: The name sure has a Dirty tag, and it sure is.
But it's perfectly balanced,
with vodka and black olives perfectly dirty, just the right amount.
Which will give you serious taste bombs.

(2) Iced vodka : It looks like a regular vodka shot, but it is served with ice which makes it perfect.

(3)Safe Sob(mocktail):
It was really refreshing , those who don't drink for them I recommend this drink, sweet as the base is orange and lime with rocks.

Stater

(1) hideout special hummus (chicken): One of my favorite dish and I can't stop myself from eating üôà,
the best part about this hummus was it is served with chicken with some spice on it, which made this dish more special,
The combination of chicken and hummus tastes great which make this dish really amazing.

(2) Chicken Bhuna (roasted) canape:  Crispy tart filled with roasted chicken in masala,
I love the combination of crispy tart and juicy chicken it's a one bite dish,
and when you will put it inside your mouth, a mouth full flavors
üòã it's an ideal dish to accompanied with drinks.

(3) falafal wrap:  Basically looks like a shwarma,
But it's nothing like an average shwarma.
A wrap with well balanced veggies and chicken served with mayo.

Main course
(1) Chicken Tikka pizza: I loved the pizza, flat crust pizza topped with delicious Chicken Tikka, fusion of Indian and Italian is really great, I recommend this pizza to everyone who wants to try something delicious and worth money.

(2) Butter chicken with roomali roti : Roomali roti was perfect lite and flat as roomaliüòã but I didn't liked the butter chicken much because it was a bit salty for my taste.

(3) Sizzler Basil chicken: It was good and flavor of Basil sauce is really amazing,
the sizzler was served with rice, stir fried vegetables and Chicken Tikka cooked in basil sauce,
the Sizzler was really healthy and tasty perfect as main course
but just with one draw back, the rice was sorta burned from the below since it was direct served on the wooden plate, only if it was served with a lettuce on the top of the plate and then rice and other stuff on it.
That way it would've been much better."
5,"Well what can we say about this place. Tucked away in High Street Pheonix, above Francesco's Pizza, this is one brilliant place.

Hideout is most popular for its cocktails and sheesha, and since we don't have both, we decided to try out their food and challenge the bartenders to make us some Mocktails.

Our Recommendations:
Demerara Toffee Apple
Virgin Siamese Twins
Virgin Creamy Santorini
Safe SOB
Hummus with Grilled Pita
Panner Shish Taouk
Pizzas
Baked Cheesecake with Raspberry Compote

We started with the Mocktails.

Demerara Toffee Apple
One delicious drink with apple juice, lime juice, demerara sugar, caramel syrup, mint leaves and crushed ice - Excellent

Safe SOB (Sex on the Beach)
Peach, orange and cranberry juice - Very Good

Island Surprise
Pineapple juice with Strawberry Crush - Very Good

Siamese Twins Virgin
Orange Juice, Cranberry juice with coconut syrup in a smokey concoction.- Excellent

Apple Ice Tea - Average

Creamy Sabratini - Virgin
A creamy chocolate drink with cinnamon and orange flavour. - Highly recommended

Pina Colada Virgin - Average

For the food we had

Hummus with Grilled Pita
We had the original hummus with the grilled pita. Loved the texture of the hummus. Every authentic in taste. Very rarely do we get to taste the hummus the way it should be. Here we did!

Batata Harra
Another dish made the Lebanese way. Potatoes diced and cooked with Lebanese spices. Very good.

Paneer Shish Taouk
A dish that should be tried. Very tender homemade cottage cheese made with Arabic spices and served with hummus and pickles. The cottage cheese just simply melted in our mouths

Cheese Naan
Quite soft and nice. Tried it standalone. Was ok. Better to be paired with some gravy.

Pizza
We had the thin crust pizza with mushroom, olives, jalape√±os and onions. Excellent pizza overall.

Alfredo Pasta
Made with white sauce, this was good but could have been better

For deserts we had

Baked Cheesecake with Raspberry Compote
Beautiful cheesecake with the perfect texture and loved the flavours overall.

Overall , we would visit this place for the food alone also. Their bartenders were excellent. Staff very attentive.

The music was very good. Vibes just felt great. Everyone around seemed to be enjoying themselves.

They have a separate section for sheesha where one can enjoy various flavours.

We strongly recommend this place. Have a nice meal, sheesha, or just chill with friends over drinks. Daytime or nighttime. This place has something for everyone. A hidden gem. Try it!!"
5,"Great place, as you would expect a restaurant at the top of a five-star hotel to be. The chili crab with mantou buns blew me away. Peking duck was also great."
5,"The mains were good and they were large portion sizes. There were two deserts which were both very good and you certainly won't be hungry after the set menu! Additionally the cocktails were great. Overall it was a great experience  and it seemed like good value.

The only downside I would say was that the music was too loud and pumping. It was maybe a bit too loud for a fine dining restaurant."
5,"Highly impressive dining experience. We ordered the set menu, it comprised of 15 courses! The starters of dim-sum and the lamb preparation was the highlight and the taste was impeccable. The mains were good and they were large portion sizes. There were two deserts which were both very good and you certainly won't be hungry after the set menu! Additionally the cocktails were great. Overall it was a great experience  and it seemed like good value.

The only downside I would say was that the music was too loud and pumping. It was maybe a bit too loud for a fine dining restaurant."
5,"Before the first bite had even hit the plate, I was already captivated by the exceptional service at By The Mekong, thanks to the delightful Marina, the host extraordinaire. From the moment I approached the stand, Marina exuded warmth and grace, greeting me with a smile and immediately guiding me to a table with a perfect view of the city. When it wasn‚Äôt quite ready, she thoughtfully led me to a comfortable seating area, taking the time to inquire about any allergies‚Äîa first in my experience in Mumbai, and one I truly appreciated.

With a menu in hand, I was given a few moments to peruse, before Marina returned, swiftly escorting me to my now-prepared table. She then made a point of informing the server of both my name and allergy‚Äîan attention to detail that speaks volumes about the level of care that defines the restaurant‚Äôs service.

Marina‚Äôs upbeat demeanor and seamless, personalized service left a lasting impression, perfectly embodying the high standards of By The Mekong. If only every dining experience could mirror this level of professionalism and hospitality.

If you‚Äôre looking to experience five star service, look no further than By The Mekong."
5,"I had one of the most memorable dining experiences at ""By the Mekong"", St. Regis Mumbai, and I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from going two days in a row! The food, the ambience, and the hospitality ‚Äì everything was just perfect.

On my first visit with a friend, I tried the Kung Pao Chicken, and it was so delicious that I immediately knew I had to bring my husband the next day. And I'm so glad I did! We enjoyed every bite ‚Äì from the Tom Kha Soup, Hong Kong Noodles, Fried Rice in  Lotus leaves, to the Stir-Fried Vegetables in Hot Garlic Sauce ‚Äì each dish was flavorful and beautifully presented.

A special mention to Diana, one of the sweetest servers I‚Äôve come across. She was genuinely warm, attentive, and made our experience even more enjoyable. It‚Äôs rare to meet staff who add such a personal touch.

To top it off, the restaurant director personally came over to greet us ‚Äì such a thoughtful and welcoming gesture! It truly made us feel noticed and valued as guests.

And the ambience ‚Äì oh, what a view! Located on the 37th floor of St. Regis, right next to Palladium, the setting is breathtaking. With its floor-to-ceiling windows and stunning skyline view, you almost forget you‚Äôre in Mumbai.

I would gladly give 5 stars for service and ambiance, and a solid 9 out of 10 for the food. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a special meal in a truly luxurious and warm setting. Will definitely be visiting again!"
5,I visited with my baby and family. It was an amazing experience. The ambience is great but prices are too high.
5,"This place had a eally aesthetic wibe and the ambience was mesmerizing.
The hospitality team was also really good and the view we get from the alley is also amazing"
5,"Been to this place last week and I must tell, they gave me the best experience so far.
The food was amazing, the staff was quick and well mannered."
5,"I recently had the pleasure of visiting The Drawing Room and The St. Regis Bar at The St. Regis Mumbai, and it was a truly luxurious and refined experience. These exquisite venues impressed me with their sophisticated ambiance, extensive beverage selection, and impeccable service.

The Drawing Room at The St. Regis Mumbai exudes an aura of elegance and charm. The tasteful decor, plush seating, and soft lighting create a comfortable and welcoming atmosphere. It's an ideal setting for indulging in a delightful afternoon tea or enjoying a serene moment with a cup of freshly brewed coffee.

The menu at The Drawing Room offers an impressive selection of teas, coffees, and light bites. From classic English breakfast teas to unique and fragrant blends, the tea connoisseur in me was thoroughly pleased. The presentation of the tea service was impeccable, accompanied by a selection of delectable treats and pastries that perfectly complemented the beverages.

The St. Regis Bar, on the other hand, is a sophisticated and vibrant space that exudes a lively and cosmopolitan atmosphere. The contemporary decor, stylish furnishings, and a well-stocked bar create an ambiance that is both chic and inviting. It's a perfect spot to unwind after a long day or to kick-start an evening of socializing.

The beverage selection at The St. Regis Bar is extensive and impressive. The skilled mixologists are masters of their craft, creating innovative and delicious cocktails that cater to a range of preferences. From classic concoctions to signature creations, each drink is expertly crafted and presented with flair. The bartenders' attention to detail and knowledge of flavors ensure a memorable and satisfying drinking experience."
3,"The quantity was so small , I couldn't imagine it ! They had written some big names on their menu and hence I opted for that . Sandwiches were of size less than that of a small pastry , Precisely , 3 √ó 3 cm . Then , the desserts were bought in a table smooth . They wouldn't be more than 10gm . Nothing was great other that decoration and seats . Really hadn't expected the same , that too from a restaurant of St Regis . I went to the bar at 5:30 pm , and they said the menu was finished . Then I showed them the timings written on their site . Then after five mins they came and said some items aren't available .  Surely , a big no the next time ."
5,"During our recent visit to Mumbai, we had the pleasure of dining at The Sahib Room located within the luxurious St. Regis Mumbai. Our experience at this upscale restaurant was nothing short of exceptional, and we are thrilled to share our five-star review.

The menu, inspired by traditional Indian flavors with a modern twist, offered a remarkable selection of dishes.

The food was expertly prepared, showcasing the chef's creativity and expertise.

The service at The Sahib Room was outstanding throughout our entire dining experience. The staff was knowledgeable, gracious, and prompt in attending to all our needs.

We recommend this incredible restaurant to anyone looking to embark on a culinary adventure in Mumbai."
5,"The Sahib Room & Kipling Bar offers an unforgettable dining and drinking experience. With its elegant, colonial-inspired ambiance, impeccable service, and a menu that blends tradition with innovation, it‚Äôs a true gem. The cocktails are expertly crafted, and the food is a delightful fusion of flavors, each dish bursting with taste. Whether you‚Äôre enjoying a quiet evening or celebrating a special occasion, this spot delivers an atmosphere of luxury and comfort. Highly recommended for anyone looking to indulge in exceptional food and drinks. A must-visit for any occasion!"
5,"Visited in April.
India. Mumbai.

Located at the St. Regis hotel, this restaurant offers classic Indian cuisine. Inside, you'll find a beautiful interior with high ceilings, stylish furniture, and stunning views from the windows.

Food:
As fans of Indian cuisine, we've always strived to find high-quality and delicious Indian food in other countries, but without success. Finally, we found ourselves in India. The menu is quite extensive, offering plenty of options. We tried the LAAL MIRCH KA LOBSTER, MURADABADI SEEKH KEBAB, and MURGH MAKHANI (butter chicken) . All dishes were prepared superbly. The lobster was incredibly tender inside with a fantastic crust, likely cooked in a tandoori oven. The balance of flavors and spices was perfect, slightly spicy and full of depth, showing mastery in preparation. Next were the grilled lamb cutlets, their texture was unusual, even softer than expected, yet the balance of spices was delightful. For the main course, we had the butter chicken, perfectly cooked chicken, tender and juicy without bones. The sauce had the right creamy consistency, with a slight tomato tang, exactly how we remembered it and fell in love with it.

Service:
The service was very attentive; the waiter explained all the dishes and even gave us some recommendations on places to visit in Mumbai. We felt well taken care of.

Conclusion:
An excellent restaurant serving local cuisine. If you appreciate comfort, delicious food, and great service, this restaurant will surely impress you."
4,"Beautiful ambience, very formal place with good food. Chef Taj Shah has magic in his hands when it comes to the authentic taste of the food. There are many options to dine in.

I wish knowing that it was our wedding anniversary, staff could have created a  special moment for us to cherish.  (The person who had taken our reservation on the phone had asked the occasion) It would have created a cherishable impact and a memorable service."
5,"Sadly, I couldn't try everything on the menu, but the three dishes I sampled were all fantastic! Here's what I highly recommend:

1. Briyani
2. Sahib ki dal-e khaas (Black lentils)
3. Ka saag"
3,I have been to various socials but this one was dampener. Maybe I happen to visit on a Monday? But that shouldn‚Äôt be a reason for such a sub par taste and service. Hope they improve so that we can visit for a second time.
2,"‚ÄúPalladium Social‚Äù is situated on the 3rd floor of Phoenix Palladium Mall (Lower Parel).

Went in for lunch on a weekday and found it okayish. Ordered Chicken Tikka Pizza and it tasted average. There weren‚Äôt sufficient chicken in the pizza and whatever were there, didn‚Äôt taste that good.
Service was slow.
Nothing much to talk about the ambiance.
Will not be visiting again !"
5,"The veg and non-veg platter is a great choice if you‚Äôre looking to enjoy a range of flavors in one dish. The variety and quality of the items make it a satisfying option for any meal. The portion was generous, making it ideal for sharing. It comfortably served two to three people. I would highly recommend it for anyone looking for a satisfying and flavorful meal."
2,"Located in the Palladium Mall. Seems more of a place for mushy teenagers looking to escape the public eye. Unnecessary eye sore PDA.
Food is average. The mutton roast was all fat. Kheema was ground buffalo which has a different unsettling taste. The dish was salty and oily seemed to be made in a haste. The chicken momo was average as well. Tables could do with some good cleaning and not sticky.
Positives-The service was quick and beers were chilled. The DJ played good music.
Sorry Socials but this was my first and last time visiting."
5,"I recently visited this location, and the vibe was impressive! The seating arrangement is comfortable, and there‚Äôs a great balance of privacy with booths and open tables.
The food and drinks were well-presented and tasted great. Service was a bit slow, but the staff was friendly and accommodating.
Perfect place for anyone looking to unwind in a relaxed environment. Looking forward to visiting again!"
1,"my experience was nothing short of disappointing. From the moment we walked in, the service was subpar. The food took forever to arrive, and when it finally did, it was cold and lacked any real flavor.

However, what really made the experience unbearable was the rude behavior of the captain. Instead of addressing our concerns with professionalism, he was dismissive and outright condescending. When we asked about the delay in our food, he shrugged it off and made us feel like we were inconveniencing him. It‚Äôs shocking to see such poor customer service from someone in charge of overseeing the dining experience.

I won‚Äôt be returning, and I would recommend looking elsewhere for a dining experience where both the food and the staff treat customers with respect."
1,"Although they have good ambience the service is very poor. Lack of staff to handle orders. When we entered no one was there to share the menu card. After 10 mins of sitting we enquired for the menu, only then did we recieve the menu card. After that there was no one yo take the order, adding 15 mins more a staff came by, he was serving other tables as well all single handedly. After placing the order 25 mins took for order to arrive. And when asked to get the sauce, there was no one coming. We asked for it about 3 to 4 times and then whilst all this when sauce arrived the food had already cooled. So we asked to cancel the other half order and asked for bill which again took 15 to 20 mins to arrive. It wasn't a good experience."
4,This place is good to visit with friends as well as family. The ambience is nice and we'll maintained. The food was also tasty. The staff was well mannered and courteous.
5,I must say it was one of the best restaurants in Vasai. I loved the ambience beautiful and pleasant. Staff was very friendly and helpful.
5,Best restaurant to visit with friends for patyy and drinks.
4,"One of the first outlet to serve shawarmas in Vasai, located at Dindayal Nagar. They have so opened another outlet near TB College, Papdy.
The taste of shawarmas is pretty good. Can definitely give a try. Parking 4 wheelers is a big task as the junction is quiet busy. Also the service gets pretty slow on weekends in the rush hours. But definitely can try once."
5,"True Taste as the name says‚Ä¶
We had white tandoori, the taste was really awesome, the shawarma was also good.
The evening times are the busiest, overall a good place to have variety of non veg dishes"
4,Very friendly staff and good food. Small place but good ambience. Gave a feel of Turkish. Waiting time is a more... But good things take time to be served 
4,Nice place to enjoy shawarmas and rolls. They also have tandoori dishes as well. True taste is vintage eatery in vasai with the taste as same as it was in its initial days.
1,It is my humble request to anyone reading this. Please do not buy any iftari items from this place. The fillings are either gooey or too salty like literally the entire iftari i regretted buying from here. PFA images of items I bought.
3,Tasted lollipop here. It's average they need to work on taste. Budget friendly üëåüëå
5,Good ambiance. Service is nice. Really comfortable for routine Chinese. Food quality and taste is good.
4,"Delicious and reasonable meal. Have been seeing a lot of Improvement in terms of dining space and service overall. But they do less on experimenting flavours, so....4 stars to encourage as there is always a room for improvement"
3,It‚Äôs a small place to eat. We had ordered Veg Triple Schezwan noodles and Egg Fried rice. We were surprised by the amount of food. We liked the Triple noodles in particular. We had gotten the food delivered at our place. The delivery was fast enough. All in all it‚Äôs a nice place to eat chinese food! I definitely recommend this place.
3,"A decent place to visit if you want cheap food with good quality. Decent food quantity. Service is a bit on the slower side. Good environment despite being a very small restaurant. Overall it gets a decent 3 star for food, service and vibe."
1,"I tried yesterday thik shake, it was very bad in taste, I think he will make fresh but they gave me stale shake which is very bad I will not recommend to try this"
1,"Today I saw a damn RAT in the bag in which they keep the buns. I told the lady at the counter that there's a little RAT in there. She just ignored it saying there's no rat. I then asked her to cancel my order as I no longer wanted to eat from a place like that.

The food and overall experience was usually good for me. However, after today, I can no longer go back to eating from this particular branch."
5,"The staff was very polite and quick as well as informative of discounts and offers , which obviously attracted more crowds. The quality of food was definitely above average. The atmosphere is good enough, no foul smells of oil or no littering around or uncleanliness was found."
1,"West of money
Cold coffee ü§ß
Service is good but not satisfied with drink quality"
1,very bad behaviour four staff because in my order is combo but see key aapka combo nahi hai and single burger hai and very argument girls behaviour not good
5,"This place is located right outside Vasai railway station. Their pure veg section is fully AC. They serve a variety of Indian, Tandoor & Fast Food dishes along with mocktails.

The taste is too good. Definitely worth visiting. Staff is also very kind."
5,"It's a nice cozy place for families. Food was very tasty. Our server was a good man. Comfortable seating. Service was fast, maybe because we went early for lunch and there were no other people.

The a.c. restaurant is on the second floor. Where nonveg also is served."
2,"Had been here a while ago and had liked the taste of the food.

However, i was disappointed during my recent visit.
The food item served was not as fresh it is suppose to be. The taste was not that great.

As it is right out side Vasai railway station on the west side, i was hoping the food served would be fresh, however that was not really the case.

On the other hand, the the place is spacious and accomodate many people.

If some one really wishes to plan a lunch or dinner here, not sure where can s/he park vehicles.

Looks likes it made to cater mostly the rail travellers."
1,"Staff needs to be more polite. Cleanliness isn't that great, wash basin clogged up. It's location next to station is a good point but I won't go there again."
4,"One of the best restaurant in Vasai which is very close to the Vasai road station for all types of delicious meals.
I always love to eat their Idli Wada sambhar dish whenever I visit this place for breakfast.
They have different sections for breakfast, vegetarian food, bar section and non-vegetarian food. They also have banquet hall for birthday parties, engagement ceremonies, etc.
Nice ambiance.
Food was tasty. Service was quick."
1,I ordered manchurian and Chinese bhel found out hairs in both. I told him he was acting like it is thread from spoon. Later I found out he was giving same Manchurian which I given him back to other person. Very unhygienic.
3,Just had paneer manchurian frankie. Taste was good the proportion of paneer was decent but there was no manchurian in it. It kinda did upset me but I think the mistake was genuine. I am giving three stars because I think they can do better.
4,Everything is very good... But they should add Manchurian in Manchurian Noodles rather than adding paneer to it... Rest the taste is good
5,Pizzaman is a very budget friendly and nice place for youngsters to hangout as well as adults. The food is also good it is quite reasonable college students can go for it and they have a pretty good sitting also people are very generous. They have a nice small first floor for college Groups for party
2,"Earlier in 2016-17, The food quality and quantity was so good that we used to have our birthday parties here!!! Now the food is not that great, we visited around 9-10 months back, after that we dint felt to visit again because of the food!!!"
5,"Tried pastries, üç© and sides. Delicious üòã
I was over monginis since quite a time due to various bakers and confectioners around here.
Today after this long, I fell in love with it again! Well Monginis has its own taste and is unmatchable! #No. 1  Even the Owner/Manager was humble and positive.
Thank you."
2,"The chicken pie's filling has become lesser than half of wat it was. The filling of one chicken pie used to be equivalent to that of 2 chicken pattices, but now the filling is lesser than even 1 chicken pattice"
3,Please start your green chattni cheese sandwich it was amazing n we miss it the time you guys stop to sell it from that day I m visiting the store only to know when it will be back...
5,"Maintenance are very good clean and neat.
Reasonable prices, no cheating.
Positive and calm, supportive
No stail food, fresh and hygienic.
Quality and test superb."
5,"The environment within the premises is very clean, the engagement is friendly and cordial.
It is a treat to have a treat at Monginis üôè"
4,"Good veg. Restaurant. Food is very good but the place is too compact.  Maharaja thali  is small in size. But they give papd chas,  sweet, pickle, sliced onion and lime in other plates.
Thali is available only in the afternoon."
5,"Patang in Sai Nagar, Vasai West, offers a new menu for breakfast. I tried the idli, medu wada, khaman, fafda-jalebi, and misal pav. The food appeared fresh, and the service was friendly. Some menu items were unavailable early in the morning. The misal pav included peas, sprouts, and spices, and extra pav was ordered. The interior is well-decorated with spacious seating. A wash basin is available at the entrance. Payment options include UPI, cash, and cards. Card payments were not accepted in the morning. Thali options are available, including a jalebi fafda combo with dhokla. Parking may be limited in the evenings."
4,"Well maintained, the waiters were not too sure about what was being served in the thali apart from that the food was good and we were happy with the portions. My mom was happy it mattered as it was Mother‚Äôs Day."
1,"The food taste is degrading day by day. Had ordered soup, machurain and Schezwan rice, all items were taste less it didn't have even salt nor any other spieces."
5,Everything is awesome! Such a cozy feel and quick service. And the taste- super delicious!!!
2,"Food taste is different, even though this comes from a shared central kitchen.
We tried volcano pizza, chicken parcel and chicken pops. The chicken in pizza and parcel was didn't taste good. Chicken pops was pathetic as if bought from Chinese outlet and spiced with peri peri. Comparatively the pizza and chi parcel was good.

They don't look after dine in other until told to do so, staff seems to be occupied with their work and customer service is left behind.

There is certainly some room for improvement."
1,"This dominos seriously needs a revamp, the toilet yuck sheee, it was so dirty not even felt like looking at it. The floors are dirty, seating table is dirty. Bhai chalaane ke liye chala rahe hai aisa lag raha hai. People wait for 5-10 mins just to give order, counter hi khali rehta hai. Hospitality, food, hygiene is on a toss here. I have been to many dominos but this is the worst one. The brands seriously needs to relook at this store specially. Spending 800+ rs on a meal and not feeling satisfied is just a waste of time & money. Band kardo usse acha yeh. Jaake dekho waha Pizza Hut bhi tha baju me wo bhi ache se maintained hai and now it has shifted to 100 ft which is also good."
1,"I have been going to Domino's for 5 years and I go there 2-3 times a month. Yesterday I spent ‚Çπ1186/-Yesterday I had to pay extra charge for Pizza Bag also. Tell me how to carry pizza box without Pizza Bag,And he said that dip is not available with garlic bread, you have to buy it separately?dominoes guys are making up rules i don't like,For example, if you order a momo, you get chutney and mayonnaise free with it. You don't need to pay extra for it, right, but Domino's has a different rule right now.I didn't like it but I'll never go to Domino's again If you go to pizza hut they also give deep or mayonnaise for free they give it extra they don't charge for it
Change your rule or policy otherwise no will be visit again........
We don't have option for the minus star I will be give - 3 star üëéüèªüëéüèª"
1,"This is one of the worst domino‚Äôs outlet in the country, have been to 100s‚Ä¶washroom worse than a public toilet, water leakage, no hygiene, staff serving without gloves and look under trained.
After talking to the outlet manager Mr.Vishvanath yadav, realised how helpless he is working here
This place needs serious work and help
Being one of the loyal costumers of the brand, coming here was an eye opener and scary."
1,"Delivery boy name Jay Rane was so rude to customer. He was arguing over address information and just dropped the food delivery on top of compound wall and left. This is disgusting, will never order again through Dominos."
1,Shop location changed or may be business closed....
1,Dont eat very bad

5,"I recently ordered a cake for my 4-year-old son‚Äôs birthday from Ribbons and Balloons in Vasai, and I must say, I was absolutely thrilled with the experience! The cake was a perfect blend of creativity and taste. I opted for a ""Squid Game"" theme, and the design was spot-on ‚Äî the attention to detail was incredible! The cake not only looked fantastic but also tasted amazing. The flavors were fresh and delicious, with a perfect balance of sweetness. It was a real hit with both the kids and adults at the party!

The owner of the shop was exceptionally friendly and helpful throughout the process. From the initial inquiry to the cake pick-up, the communication was smooth and prompt. The owner took the time to understand exactly what I wanted and offered helpful suggestions to make sure everything was perfect. It was evident that they genuinely cared about customer satisfaction.

Overall, the service was outstanding, and I would highly recommend Ribbons and Balloons to anyone looking for a custom cake in Vasai. The cake was not only a visual treat but also a culinary delight, and the customer service was top-notch. I‚Äôll definitely be returning for future celebrations!"
4,I had ordered unicorn cake for my daughter and animal cake for my son. Both the cakes designs were perfect as per my requirement and so the taste. Everyone loved it. My only suggestion is if they can have base with different flavors for fancy cakes other than chocolates. Thank you!
5,Excellent service - cake was ready on time inspite of national holiday. Fondant uniquely different and tasted very good.  Not only delicious cake but the look was also good as expected
5,"This is my favorite cake shop. Either I buy pastries and cakes from east evershine gate outlet or this one.
Their eggless cakes are actually eggless hence I prefer this outlet over other.
This outlet is at Manikpur, not easy to be seen when you come from Babhola end.
Price and quality is comparable.
They don't have parking hence people have to park on road and make traffic more congested."
5,"One of the best cake shop for having a huge variety of cakes with different flavours.
It's always a good experience to try out new flavours from this store. This time I tried the fruit forest cake for my dad's birthday! It was amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è The staff is very good and polite."
4,"Quite place, good food !
Located opposite J.B. Ludhani school, this place serves Indian, Moghlai and Chinese foods. Ambience is good, there is a separate seating for family crowd. Apple Chicken is a must have here. We ordered multiple items like Apple Chicken, Chicken triple schezwan rice, Chicken noodles and manchow soup. Food is worth a try and overall experience is good enough."
5,"Owner behaviour with client also good, VEG./NON. VEG. Malvani, Kolhapuri, Chines, Champaram etc. variety of hygienic food available at one place. Charges also reasonable."
5,"This cozy restaurant has left the best impressions! Hospitable hosts, delicious dishes, beautiful presentation and wonderful dessert. Staff is also very excellent and well behaved. I know this restaurant from last 13 years and would recommend everyone to visit this restaurant every now and then! I would like to come back here again and again."
1,"It was one of the best restaurant earlier, the food taste and quality was amazing, it was worth paying for. But now the quality and taste has dropped drastically every time I order, I have to regret. I gave try 5-7 times thinking this time it will be better, but no. They really need to improve the taste and quality like before."
5,"Relish restaurant is one of the first restaurants started in Evershine city, I personally am a customer for more than 17 years. The quality of food is best and both the brothers (owners) try their best to provide the best food experience to all its customers. Chinese dishes are the best and so the other food items. Order it on phone or through online facility or visit the restaurant itself, you'll be satisfied with the food that's for sure. So what are you waiting g for, go ahead and try it if you haven't tried it yet."
5,"Greetings to Aao khao's owner... I've been trying to get in touch with you as I wanted to know if you still are operational. If yes, kindly share me address and contact details."
5,"Good tasty food, to take home and eat. The kitchen is open you can see the chef's running around , it's clean and hygienic kitchen, only issue there is no seating to sit and have food, and since its on a narrow road, you have to be careful about parking, but once these are over looked it a really good place to order food and take home to enjoy with family.the last thing to mention is the staff are friendly as well."
3,"The food is amazing and tasty,  Good quantity and worth the cost but very time consuming. Had been waiting for a long time to get d order n  there was a huge confusion with the order and forgetfulness among the guys there,  even after correcting d order twice. Management needs to get better."
5,"Delicious food very good quality and quantity superb experience
Would highly recommended to everyone"
5,Best Dragon Chicken and Burnt chilly fried rice. Ridiculously soft fried chicken. I don't know how they make their food so good... Great stuff
4,Small Fully loaded Monginis Outlet at Evershine near carnival cinema....they house almost everything here in bakery items except freshly baked breads ..you can get cookies chocolates pastries n cakes ...they can help you out with birthday marriage n other parties with all the accessories that you might need candles ballons etc etc....nice sweet shop managed by lovely helping staff... give it a try whenever you need these items ..
5,"I have been visiting this Monginis outlet for the last 10 years now. Excellent management, very friendly staff. The best part is the warm welcome and greeting in every festival. Keep rocking guys."
1,They have messed it up after they've renovated. They've been ordering only veg cakes from the company and no longer keep cakes with eggs. The taste of the cakes has become horrible and is not like before. Either go to Bravo or Ocakes cake shops in the neighborhood.
1,I bought two cake from evershine city vasai branch but the cake was horrible. It was expired the taste the quality everything was poor. I would prefer to give u guys negative rating. Not even one both the cakes were spoiled. Would never buy cake from u guys ever again. Poor quality......
1,Need to upgrade the quality..being a big name in cake industry and having bad quality cake not fair..This is my 3rd time buying the cake from this branch but no improvement seen..the cake sponge was dry enough to give a negative ranking..i hope u'll improve...
5,"Sometimes a simple, regular burger can be the most satisfying. Glad to enjoyed it!"
4,"The McDonald's at Evershine City is always a reliable stop for a quick bite. Some staff is friendly and efficient, and the food is consistently good. The restaurant is clean and well-maintained, with quick service even during busy hours. While the seating area can get crowded at times, it‚Äôs a great place for a fast, satisfying meal."
4,"Amazing place to dine-in/takeaway/delivery!
Seating arrangements are good.
However, The AC doesn't give proper cooling so you might feel hot a little bit. DON'T trust the pictures on the display as always. The size of the burger is small compared to the pictures of course. But it's pretty stuffing. The food is good."
5,"This McDonald's was very clean, quick service, washrooms was clean. They have ample parking space too. Staff is well courteous. Good to see that Majority of the staff are women. Keep up the good work."
3,"McDonald's is a great place to hangout in Evershine City. Strategically located in Dreams Mall, adjacent to the Holy Family Convent School this place is a hub for youngsters and parents who come with their kids. The place is spacious and the staff is friendly and accomodating. However, in terms of menu there is not much variety compared to KFC, Subway and Burger King. The air conditioning only works for a small seating area, which at times is booked for birthday parties, so visit this place only if AC is not a priority for you. They don't even have fans, so it's either AC or nothing at all."
4,"Our family visited Skybar for a Sunday dinner. Its spacious which made it comfortable for our family to settle in without feeling cramped. The restroom was clean and surprisingly spacious, a small but important detail when dining out with family.

The elevator ride up was marred by unsightly paan stains‚Äîa real eyesore. Additionally, the stairs leading to the restaurant are poorly lit.

The view from the Skybar is unfortunately hindered by this huge sticker-like design on the glass windows, so don‚Äôt expect breathtaking cityscapes at night. That said, the overall vibe inside is pleasant enough.

The band was excellent that evening. The acoustics of the venue left something to be desired. Pro tip: Avoid sitting to the sides of the stage, as the audio quality there is subpar. Opt for seats directly in front or further away for a better experience.

We decided to go for a range of various dishes. The food at Zeal Skybar ranged from delightful to disappointing. Some dishes truly shone, earning top marks: Mushroom and Cheese Cigar Rolls (5/5), Cheddar Stuffed Chicken (5/5) and the Mushroom Chilli (5/5)

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the French fries (2/5), which were limp, lacked crispiness, and tasted like low-quality potatoes‚Äîa major letdown for such a basic dish. Also the alcohol content in the cocktails (Long Island Iced Tea, Special Mojito) was questionable. The shots we tried (Brain Hemorrhage, Brain Tumor) were good, but lacked that punch.

Our total bill came to around ‚Çπ5,500 for six people, which felt reasonable given the portions and variety of dishes we ordered. Prior reservations are recommended, especially for weekends, as the place can get busy.

Would I visit Skybar again? Absolutely‚Äîbut with some adjustments. Next time, I‚Äôll skip the French fries, steer clear of overly complicated cocktails, and make sure to grab a seat with better acoustics."
5,"Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ (4/5)

Zeal Restaurant offers a unique dining experience with a combination of live music and mouth-watering dishes.

Ambiance:
The ambiance of Zeal hits you right from the entrance. The dim lighting coupled with chic and modern decor provides a cozy atmosphere. The inclusion of live music further amplifies the dining experience. The performers are not only skilled but also interact with the audience, making the entire atmosphere lively and engaging.

The name says it all ‚Äì the food here is genuinely tasty. . The basa fish we ordered was is a flavorful melange of tender piece marinated in sauce, sprinkle of fresh greens. It's hearty and utterly satisfying.

For vegetarians, they have good options thou, we ordered veg chopper rice, onion rings, chessy fries
The staff at Zeal is courteous and attentive. They ensure that guests are comfortable and are quick to respond to any requests or queries.

While the restaurant is largely impressive, the acoustics might be a bit of an issue for some. The combination of live music, chatter, and other ambient noises can sometimes make it difficult for diners to have a quiet conversation."
1,"The service was bad and so late. They didn't even approach the table to take orders we had to locate and call them. We had ordered a starter and main course and some drinks. The starter and drinks came within 15 min, but we are waiting close to an hour for the main course. The waiters/servers attended larger groups very actively over us (we were 3 girls) it's like we were invisible. The drink was too sweet, we left it as it is and the starter was ok, it felt like a ready made packet fried snack. Also the items are over priced. We had gone to celebrate but had the worst experience. We cancelled the main course as we were losing time and paid the rest. It was pain to pay for the dinner we didn't even complete. They don't seem to care much even after telling them the bad service, the server didn't care much.

Bad Service. Bad experience."
1,It's just a good name skybar but the service provided here is third class and the food quality is so worst. they just ignore there guests and don‚Äôt want to attend them. we ask for food parcel and they literally ask us can i pack onion lemon also. seriously skybar u have to change ur whole service team. they are just useless person working over here.
1,"We visited this place last week, hoping to relive the amazing experience we had last year (Jan 2024) with all my cousins. Unfortunately, this time was a complete disappointment. Due to technical issues, the live music ended around 10 PM, which was unacceptable, especially on a weekend. The management should have ensured a smooth experience, but instead, we had to request multiple times before they finally played some songs for us to dance and enjoy.

The food was average. We ordered lollipops, but they were undercooked.It was a total waste of money.
Given this experience, I would not recommend this place to anyone."
4,"This property special for nonveg food. You will love it. Peacefull place, There is small swiming pool but owner is giving option for big pool. Bathroom water is salty. Owner is working for the water üíß filtering project. Shitladevi temple is around 2-3 km. Rooms are ok"
5,The best seafood you can discover over here
1,Owner denied that he accepted the order and is not ready to cancel from his end since the mentioned item is out of stock. Owner was very arrogant on call
4,Super lovely food and competitively priced. They do take a bit of time before the order arrives but that doesn't really affect as much because the food is wonderfully cooked and presented with very good quantity. There is also a family section for people who wouldn't prefer drinking yet enjoy the wonderful ambience and food. Hygienic and courteous staff. Best place to have a wonderful meal in Naigaon
4,Nice bar calm atmosphere food was good and service was very good .
1,"Extremely disappointing experience at this overhyped and overrated shop. The food was average, but the service was appalling. The shopkeeper was rude and unaccommodating, delaying our order on purpose and making us feel unwelcome. The fact that we were asked to stay outside despite having an eating area was insulting. To top it off, the shopkeeper had the audacity to put our food aside and show us a sign that said ""pay first"" while we were already in the process of paying. Clearly, this shop doesn't value its customers. Wouldn't recommend."
4,I went there after 4years but can‚Äôt see that much hype it use to have first. My personal favourite were the Samosa pav as it is served with different flavoured chutney that taste suprrr amazing üòå that made my day √≠t reminded me of my childhood when I use to come here ‚ô•Ô∏è
4,"Tungareswar ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡•Ä‡§ü

Nice place for sweet and namkeen and farsan and snacks. Attention has also been paid to cleanliness. The samosa festival here is very tasty and that too sixty of chutneys.

This shop is very near to the station."
5,"I recently visited Tungareshwar Sweet & Farsan in Vasai and I must say, I was thoroughly impressed! This is the oldest sweet mart in Vasai and has been serving delicious treats for decades. It's no wonder why all the local schools, colleges, and offices order their samosas from here.

As soon as I walked in, I was hit with a wave of nostalgia. The old-school charm of the place instantly transported me back to simpler times. What made it even better was the fact that the staff was the same as it was 15 years ago! It's truly heartwarming to see the same smiling faces behind the counter, still dedicated to serving their customers with the same passion.

But let's talk about the food. The samosas were out of this world. Perfectly crispy on the outside and filled with the most delicious mixture of spiced potatoes on the inside. It's no wonder why this place has such a loyal following.

And if you're not in the mood for samosas, don't worry. Tungareshwar Sweet & Farsan offers a wide variety of mouth-watering treats that will satisfy any craving. From sweets to savory snacks, everything is made fresh daily and with the utmost care.

Overall, I highly recommend Tungareshwar Sweet & Farsan to anyone in Vasai or the surrounding area. The nostalgic atmosphere combined with the delicious food and friendly staff make this place a must-visit. Don't miss out on this gem of a sweet mart!"
1,"Avoid This Overhyped and Dishonest Snack Corner!
This place is a complete disappointment. It's wildly overrated, and the food is mediocre at best. Even the ""vada pav""  was utterly average.
The vendors are clearly focused on pushing out cold, stale food as quickly as possible. They exhibit a complete disregard for customer satisfaction.
Worse still, they seem to actively try to scam customers. Expect to be overcharged, with prices exceeding the MRP. You'll likely be served old, stale food, and the staff is consistently rude and unhelpful.
This snack corner embodies everything that's wrong with a food establishment. It's a complete rip-off and a waste of time. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere."
2,The place is not that good. And to add to it its over priced. Also the taste is just below average avoid this place. There's no table service also. Just giving an advice think twice before you visit and do your best to avoid this place.
4,"Loved their cheese burger and fries
Most of the students crowd come here to chill out and have their special burgers
You will easily get this place as it is near the station

5,"Had a wonderful experience at Madhuram Restaurant!
They serve excellent South Indian food full of authentic flavors and perfectly prepared.
We ordered their Paneer Chilly, Madhuram special paneer curry (one of their specialties), Paratha and Garlic Naan and it was absolutely delicious.
We also tried their Aamrasüòã, and it was truly the best we‚Äôve had - rich, smooth, and bursting with natural sweetness.
The ambience is pleasant and welcoming, and the service was quick and courteous.
Also, highly recommend trying their Parathas and Churma Laddu both were made with fresh, aromatic ghee and tasted absolutely delicious! Every bite felt homely and authentic.
Highly recommend Madhuram for anyone looking for great taste, good vibes, and a satisfying meal!"
5,"In Vasai West Branch. Good Environment. Overall it's a gud experience. Before v use to go Kubera. Bt, must say. Madhuram is better then Kubera. No doubt.
They hv kept in all table. Sam leav chutni. Vry gud. Must try once. Afterall it's complimentary..."
4,"It's a good option while searching for a pure vegetarian food with a good ambiance.
The place is always crowded because of their food taste and food quality.
The ambiance was nice.
Nicely done interior design.
Ample space for dining was available.
The food was good with a good quantity and reasonable rates."
5,This restaurant is one of the oldest and most popular restaurants in Vasai. Serving some pure veg delicacies. Beautiful photogenic ambience. Super spacious. They have live chat counters and outdoor seating as well. It is always crowded on weekends so prior booking is recommended. It's a perfect place for family lunch and dinner dates. The quality and quantity of food is   very good. Excellent service. A must visit if you are in Vasai. Dont forget to follow me for more such interesting recommendations.
4,"We are regular visitors of Madhuram Vasai (West). This is one of the best vegetarian hotels. Food quality is good against the prices. Service is good. No complaints, recommended for vegetarians."
3,"Pizzaman has been a nostalgic spot for me since 2010. It's a small and cozy place with a great vibe, especially for college-goers. We used to write our names and messages on the walls, and it‚Äôs nice to see that tradition still continues today. After many years, I revisited and had the chicken dragon soup and chicken shashlik sizzler‚Äîboth favorites from the past. While the food was good, I did miss the original taste I remembered. Also, the servers have changed, and they didn‚Äôt seem familiar with the menu. It was an okay experience."
1,"Second time Hair in my food, last time i got an hair inside chicken lollipop fry, This time in chicken Bombay Rice, like seriously, Yukkk!!! I feel like the hair is still stuck in my throat. The manager also was very casual about it, like it's always happening there. Please dont go there,& if you still want chicken fried hairs or chicken hairy rice its your choice."
4,"The Thai and taro boba tea at this restaurant was delightful at Rs. 150 each. However, service was slow as we waited 5-8 minutes for the waiter to bring the menu and another 5-8 minutes for our order. Despite the delay, the delicious Boba tea made the wait worthwhile."
4,"I ordered veg crispy and tripple schezwan rice. I asked for less spicy rice but they served almost no spice in it. Little disappointed.
Now they have added boba shakes and they are just yumm. Must try Tara Bubble Tea. I tried jain paneer chopper rice and its was quite good."

Perfect place for quick bite. Sufficient standing place."

Hygiene is a big joke here.
Arrogance of staff is really concerning. They‚Äôre very rude to customers."
4,"Located near Vasai East station, this place serves snacks at value for money prices. The taste and place hygiene is good. However there is no place to sit and no space to even park a two wheeler as it is located right outside station. I have had South Indian snacks, wada pav and samosa here. Taste is good and prices are moderate."

They offer a wide range of delectable food options and provide excellent service as well.

My personal favorite is the 'Masala dosa' from Ketki, which is truly one of the best dosas I have ever had. The portion sizes are generous and make for a satisfying brunch option."

3,The ambience is welcoming and cozy. That it is on the main road does not take away the warmth of this place. The owner is a down to earth person. Food might take a while to prepare as it is made to order. The menu is varied. We ordered chicken burger meal and buffalo wings. The burger was a bit woody and the fries salty. The Buffalo wings was too crisp. The overall experience was good.
4,"Very nice place
But slow in making your order since they make everytjing frash and hot but one have to wait there for atleast half an hour to get their order.

I tried T rex burger there its very nice for those who loves to eat chicken and egg in one burger.

Place is nice neat and clean
capacity is around 15 to 18 people

They also make custom drinks if one wants like I had sprite in my drink whereas they generally provide that blue drink with Duke's soda only

There quality quantity and fries are the best part
They also have chicken popcorn pizza burgers drinks non alcoholic beverages and what not üòã
Very wide range of menu.
Perfect place to Hangout with friends who loves to eat"
4,"We ordered Chicken cheese burger, Chicken Crispy burger, Hot & Spicy wings and Peri Peri wings. Both wings were absolutely delicious, somehow burgers were little blant. The overall taste was good. But the Bombay burgers located in Bandra has better taste. The interior and ambiance is great."
4,"Nice fast food joint to enjoy pizza, burger, pasta, sandwiches and other crunches in less value. We ordered crispy chicken fries and T-Rex. Food is good. Ambience is also good."
5,"Really tasty and very good chicken. Every chicken frankie has a lot of chicken inside, and even the chicken popcorn is delicious. Plus, prices are also fair. Very convenient for daily train passengers since its right outside the ticket counter. Must try."
4,"Rishikesh brings back a lot of memories. This is the restaurant where I used to have veg cutlets and masala dosa with my parents when I was 6. It's pure nostalgia. Of course, the interiors have changed, the staff are all new, and things have improved, but the food still remains the same. It's that good old taste of railway food, if you know what I mean. Parking remains a major concern since this place is located on the main road near the railway station. They don't accept card payments; however, they accept UPI and cash. I had mirch tava paneer, which won my heart, and it's even better when paired with paneer pulao."
5,"Best budget hotel in Vasai, just next to Vasai Depot.
One of the best place to have South Indian food, punjabi food is also good."
3,"The restaurant is located on very busy street near Vasai Railway station. The food found not that OK. Especially, the taste of Sambar was not up to the mark. Services are very slow. The illumination was found dull. Its OK to visit if a person is in transit."
4,"Had been to this place earlier for a breakfast which was okay.
For a change visited for dinner.
The place had been renovated,
The service was quick.

1,"We used to dine every Saturday here. But on 4th Mar23, we were refused entry on the reason that there was a certain odour coming from us when we visited the place the last time. The last time we visited, the assistant asked us what was  odour but He couldn't confirm that it came from us . We too couldn't confirm that it came from us. So on 4th Mar , we informed the counter staff that there were few incidents like serving the wrong brand of beer when ordered, not taking our suggestion to shut the AC as it was getting colder but the counter staff didnt listen to us. On few occasions we had to leave the place urgently as our requests were not taken. Several times , the staff were rude , insulting and misbehaving, food is bad, PLEASE DO NOT VISIT THIS HORRIBLE PLACE AS IT IS NOT WORTH GOING.HORRIBLE STAFF, BAD FOOD, UNHYGIENIC PLACE."

Nice and co-operative staff, food is ok and all brands are reasonable"
1,"Very poor and decay food providing here. Because of this, I got very sick from eating that food. Very cheep and sada hua food they are providing. Requesting all of you dont go at such place to drink and eat."
1,This is not a restaurant. It is a jail because everything that they serve here is similar to the food served in jail but jails have a better ambience.
2,pathetic sanitation.. u will puke once u enter the rest room. you will see rats crawling over chopped onions and mouth freshners around the corner.. extremely noisy and not worthy to the money you will spend here
5,"It is a really nice authentic Indian cuisine restaurant that is prepped fresh and served with efficiency.

All the dishes served bursts with flavour and often added their own little twist that elevated them just that little bit more.

Service was excellent and very helpful."
5,"A slight mix-up with our order turned into a happy accident, as we were treated to both variations of the Kadak Roomali - which were absolutely amazing. The food just kept getting better as the evening went on, with the Rawalpindi Gosht being a personal highlight - a truly stunning dish with just the right amount of spice. To our surprise, and despite it being peak dinner time, we received an amazing 50% discount on our drinks thanks to a happy hour offer. The restaurant itself seemed popular with a local crowd, including families and young couples, which is always a good sign."
1,"Copper Chimney is a very old and popular restaurant in Mumbai. I have heard only good things about this restaurant. Hence decided to head out here for a family lunch. We decided to try out the buffet and what a horrible decision that was. The entire spread looked so delectable, however not every item on the menu was good. A lot of the chicken was undercooked and almost raw and pink. The seafood dishes, especially the one with the prawns was stinking. It was as though they hadn't washed the seafood or used stale produce. I do not recommend the buffet here at all."
5,"The bestest fine dine restaurant off Mumbai. I luv Dum Aloo Kashmiri with Rumali Roti here. I go this restaurant once a month to eat this
The taste at Worli IS same.
Other CC doesn't deliver same taste"
5,"Really awesome experience. Lovely food and very helpful staff. Really loved the service provided by Nitin and Siddhesh. Kudos to both of u. Special thanx to Chef Suresh for making our family lunch truly memorable. It felt nostalgic to come to the Worli outlet after such a long time. The quality still remains topnotch. Having heard about Mr. Kapur from my Dadaji whom he had met at the time of partition with food being the common point, there always a part of homeliness in the food here and a feeling of apnapan n love."
4,"Nice place to grab a quick bite or have a decent lunch. The place is slightly difficult to notice if you are not familiar. Offers nice food, place is clean and hygienic. If you are in lower Parel then this is a perfect place to grab a quick breakfast. They have token system,so will have to buy a token first and give order at the counter. Offers amazing Beetroot Halwa but try and have while it's hot ;-)"
4,"It‚Äôs great place to have amazing South Indian food.

We had ghee roasted dosa‚Ä¶which was ü§§ it was good we could eaten it without sambhar and chutney. Let me tell their saambhar is amazing feeling like made in HOME. Chutney was good.

Also we had idlis they were good was not amazing‚Ä¶ I think we should have tried for ulundu dosa instead of it.

Filter coffee was superb‚Ä¶worth the dime."
2,"Restaurant is serves south indian authentic food.
Cost : High and increasing every year with no improvement in quality or quantity. Pathetic.üò°üò§
Service:  is below average due to low staff.
Now a days they have restricted service for Dosas orders which are available only after 9:30 am which is disgusting and at the whims and fancies of the owner.
There other options to the restaurant in the same street if Dosa is on your mood.

Food: Although Dosas are good but prices are fluctuating upwards every 3-6 months hence no stable fix price.

Atmosphere: No atmosphere at such less space for sitting area."
5,"Very traditional South Indian but you will also get the normal lunch food and sweets and tea and filter coffee ‚Ä¶

2,"Cockroaches!! Literal cockroaches roaming on the counter. The place is loaded with packaging to the ceiling because it allegedly serves more as a takeaway station for Zomato orders. Shouldn't they have a could kitchen for that? There are tables and chairs but they are also occupied by packaging. We had to order take out because they declined seating ""on weekends"". Three of the items we ordered were not available despite it being the weekend. Even if it serves for Zomato orders everything should be available right? We love some of the food they offer but it was sad to see this is how the place actually looks like :( I'm adding pictures as well."
4,"The first thing you notice as you step into the latest bar and restaurant of The St. Regis, Mumbai is classic opulent European luxury- beautifully set tables, polished silverware, gold chandeliers, luxuriant wallpaper and deep, comfortable chairs. A modern European restaurant and lounge bar, located at a dreamy sky-high level 37 of The St. Regis serves European cuisine enveloped in modern flavors.¬†The menu brings European flavours to the fore while the ambience soothes your craving for a high-energy escapade or a more relaxing atmosphere depending on your mood! Located across two levels, the luxurious space offers guests the choice to enjoy live music at the bar that offers domestic and international liquors with a varied choice of in-house infusions or to ascend a dramatic spiral staircase to arrive at Luna Gusta- the fine dine restaurant. The bar also turns into a pulsating nightclub on weekend nights that features a in-house DJ."
5,"Recently I had the opportunity to dine at Luna Nudo in St. Regis. It was an experience to remember. Right from its beautiful entrance to its uber classy interiors to its impeccable service, everything about my time in Luna Nudo made me feel special!

The entire menu of the drinks and the food of Luna Nudo is carefully curated. I was very happy to meet Chef Megha there, who took me through her professional journey and the story behind the food of Luna Nudo with beautiful smile. I am so happy to know that she is the first female chef to be appointed by St. Regis, and have been associated with the brand for a year now :)

The basic ideal behind the food menu of this place is to keep the flavours simple and true to its origins. I did get the sense of that in the flavour profile of all the dishes that I ordered there.

Let me tell you what I tried :

Moctails :
Billionaire's Coffee - 5/5 (Highly Recommended)
Red Current - 5/5 (Highly Recommended)
Star Gaze - 5/5 (Highly Recommended)

Cocktail :
Luna 37 - 5/5 (Highly Recommended)

Appetizers :
Avocado Toast Cream Cheese & Shaved Truffles - 5/5 (Highly Recommended)
Butter Garlic Prawns - 5/5 (Highly Recommended)

Mains:
Hand Cut Fettuccine with Lamb - 5/5 (Highly Recommended)
Truffle Roast Chicken - 5/5 (Highly Recommended)

Dessert :
Flaming Mud Cake - 5/5 (Highly Recommended)

Luna Nudo is a place where you should come with some time in hand, not just to eat and drink, but to soak in overall ambience as well. That's what I did, and I would gladly love to come back and do it all over again :)"
5,"Visited here to celebrate an event. Being on the top of St. Regis, it's one of the highest restaurants in the country offering great views of the city.
The ambience lives upto the reputation of a 5-star with beautiful lighting and chandeliers.

5,Quality of food is amazing... Would definitely rank amongst the top 10 Chinese joints of Mumbai
5,"Awesome food that savours your buds, the name says it all, freshly cooked delectable delecacies just flow thier way exclusively from China. Must visit."
5,"The place undoubtedly serves some amazing Chinese food. The prices are super reasonable for the quantity and quality. We got our lunch delivered from the outlet. Everything was well packed and looked tempting. What we had:
Kung pao Potato: classic at its best. Perfect blend of flavours.
Paneer Chilly: super fresh paneer, amazing tossed with chillies!
Triple Schezwan Rice: the taste was good, however the proportion of gravy could be increased a little. Else no complaints!
Chilli Garlic Noodles: Great taste, just how it‚Äôs supposed to be!
Overall, great food was delivered.

Will we recommend: For Sure!
Will we order again: Definitely!"

A restaurant serving many variety of wings. Their logo catched me, very nice. Thought of ordering it for a dinner.

Korean hot wings, were thick with good covering and tossed in Korean style sauce. Little spicy wings can be enjoyed really hot.
Lemon pepper chicken. Dish of the meal.
Chicken chunks batter fried and tossed in black pepper and lemon juice along with few mix peppers and spring onions.

Stir fry chicken in soy coriander sauce, cornflour batter fried chicken tossed in soy based medium thickness gravy with coriander and some mix peppers, consistency of the gravy was perfect.
Veg friend rice little dry rice with mix vegetables was good with gravy which we ordered."

1) Manchurian- the tastiest and good quantity
2)paneer chili- again the quality of paneer is good and a tasty dish
3)wok tossed noodles..this had twice the quantity we get in Normal restaurant and tasty and fresh..
4)triple schezwan rice - it consists of Manchurian, hakka noodles, gravy , schezwan rice..this also has a very good quantity and tastes amazing
5)veg manchow soup- thick and tsty ..taste best with fried noodles."
5,"I am a big fan of momo‚Äôs, Chinese food item and can never say no for it. While going through Zomato I located this delivery outlet. So I placed an order for-
Non-veg dimsum platter-
The quantity was really good according to the price range. And there was different types of dimsum/ momo‚Äôs. Few were of chicken and few of prawns. I loved the prawns much.

Non-veg noodles bento box-
It was like Chinese thali for me. Which had momo‚Äôs, noodles, chicken gravy. And the quantity was also really good. The noodle was bit spicy for me.

Chicken triple sichuan rice-
It was a bit mixture of rice and noodles. The gravy was included and mixed together with the rice. Not that spicy so I loved it."
5,"Tao 9 it is just a delivery outlet at the Gandhi Nagar lower Parel..
To have the food at home , office or any other place it is best to have it from here it is my recommendation they are serving the excellent quality of the food and after having it you will be fully satisfied wht you pay..

We have started with the the chicken in hot garlic sauce:- In this you will get the chicken which is cooked nicely with the little thick gravy which make the taste nice

Chicken chilli:- You must had lots of different varieties of chicken chilli in the restaurant, but after having it you will find something new which make up to have some more of it

Finally we have ended up with butter garlic prawn:- They are not only just prawns they are tiger prawns , they are marinated in the sauce with thick gravy which once you had you would like to have more the quantity is also more

According to the money it is more than enough..

4,"Lots of crowds on Fridays and the weekends obviously. So its better to reserve a table in advance if you're visiting as a group.
The atmosphere, ambience and the music at this place is 10/10. Just the perfect place to hangout with friends. The food is a bit pricey for the quantity, the taste is decent. Since there are a lot of visitors, the service time is longer than usual.
You can check the alcohol prices on their app, which keep fluctuating. Make sure to grab the deal.
Overall a 4/5 and you can visit this place if you're looking for a place to hangout in Lower Parel."
3,"Good Ambiance | Average Food | Moderately Priced | Very limited options for non-drinkers

This is a good place to party in Lower Parel. Mostly you will find office crowd here partying. On weekends the place is totally packed so make sure you reserve a table in advance and also ensure you reach there on time as they will hold the table just for 10 mins max.
The liquor has fluctuating price so keep tracking your choice on their app for best deals.
If you have non-drinkers in the group then they will have only 2-3 options in mocktails and they are also average.
Food quality and taste needs improvement big time. Basic fries or chicken strips are also disappointing.
There is valet parking available."
4,"The Bar Stock Exchange in Lower Parel offers a diverse experience for patrons looking to wind down after a long day. While the cocktail selection may be somewhat limited, the four different LIIT options certainly pack a punch, with the Mexican LIIT standing out as a favorite.

The culinary journey begins with a selection of appetizers including the flavorful Chinese BHEL, succulent chicken tikka, mouthwatering chicken wings, and delectable paneer tikka. Despite being asked to move tables due to prior reservations, the staff ensured a seamless transition and even provided a nicer table, adding to the overall positive experience.

Moving on to the main course, options like the chicken Khao Suey, veg Hakka, and peri peri wings continue to impress with their delicious flavors. The meal is perfectly rounded off with a decadent Death by Chocolate dessert.

Overall, The Bar Stock Exchange offers a great atmosphere to unwind, complemented by good food and just the right level of music‚Äînot too loud to overpower conversation. It's a place where patrons can enjoy a satisfying culinary experience while relaxing in a comfortable setting."
4,"The highlight of my evening was undoubtedly the innovative concept of fluctuating drink prices, mirroring the dynamic nature of the stock market. It added an extra layer of excitement to the already lively atmosphere, making each drink order feel like a strategic investment. This engaging twist on pricing not only keeps patrons on their toes but also injects an element of unpredictability, making every visit a truly unique experience.

Located in the heart of Mumbai, the Bar Stock Exchange boasts a remarkable selection of English music, setting the perfect backdrop for a night of enjoyment and relaxation. The carefully curated playlist complemented the overall vibe, creating a delightful fusion of music and merriment.

The menu at Bar Stock Exchange offers a diverse range of options, from delectable appetizers to satisfying main courses. The culinary experience was on par with the high standards set by the ambiance. The quality of the food, coupled with the inventive drink menu, ensures that patrons can indulge in a well-rounded and satisfying dining experience"
4,"Good food, good ambience, nice place to chill and hang out,

The alcohol is reasonable and as the name suggests and as we all know the prices of the alcohol keep fluctuating based on which alcohol is being purchased the most. Surprisingly but not so surprisingly sometimes we got the 12 year old whiskey was cheaper than the 10year old same brand. So it was fun.

Japanese whiskey was cheaper when no one was ordering.

The concept is fun and you get to try different types of whiskey."
5,"An unusual request of asking the restaurant owner to get me the number for type change guy, located next door to hers. Without blinking an eyelid she sent someone to get me the emergency contact I needed and messaged me. It wasn‚Äôt a part of her work or related to F&B but just mentioning this review as it‚Äôs a cool act of humanity and simply being nice. Thanks a lot."

As the name suggests, it was an experience, complete with a personalised cocktail (delicious) and a souvenir hard cover book of the inspirations behind their signature cocktails. Never had such a good dessert in my life. The price is actually very reasonable for what you get, which is a 9 course meal and exceptionally friendly service! Shout out to Tilak for his fun explanations of each dish, personal touches, and remaking one of our surprise drinks just because we didn't love it üôèüåº"
4,"Bomany Canteen is celebrating its 10th anniversary with a lineup of OG dishes, and we got to indulge in plenty of their Chota starters‚Äîeach one packed with flavor. The cocktails were on point, and the vibe made it a great spot to visit with friends and family. Definitely worth a visit!"
1,"This place is the most disappointing I have ever been in my life. The food is extremely pathetic. We ordered 4 dishes:
1. Ghee Roast Seekh Kebab - it was average, nothing to rave about.
2. Corn Locho - this dish was disgusting. They gave us corn puree with farsan.
3. Prawns Chetinad - The prawns were floating in oil and the server recommended that we dip the bread in the oil and eat. Again DISGUSTING.
4. Biscuit Sandwich Icecream (not sure of the fancy name) - We paid 800 for 1 jim jam biscuit, a pair of Krack jack biscuit and 1 bourbon biscuit, all with ice cream in between. Complete disaster and waste of money.

You can go there to chill out but not for the food. Worst food and experience ever."
3,"Pros:
Attentive and friendly service
Cons:
Food is just average, failing to live up to the hype and price tag.
Portion sizes are on the smaller side, making the overall value proposition weak.
Recommendation:
Considering the high cost in relation to the quality and quantity of food, you might be better off exploring other restaurants in Kamala Mills that offer more bang for your buck. There are many great places in the area that serve delicious Indian cuisine with more generous portions at a more reasonable price."

3,"Masala Kitchen is a delivery kitchen located in Worli besides Casa De Cafe on Dainik Shivner Road...

This outlet is famous for its North Indian dishes and we ordered a few of their signature dishes... Like :-

1) Trio Chicken - 6 pieces of boneless chicken marinated in 3 different colours - orange, white and green it and grilled over the tandoor till well done... The taste of these 3 different marinations was amazing and lip smacking. Definitely recommended...

2) Chicken Tikka Biryani - The biryani was tasty and it consisted boneless pieces of chicken tikkas. Biryani flavour was nice. Liked the biryani out here.

3) Butter Chicken - Succulent pieces of chicken marinated in red tomato gravy and cooked till perfection... The only thing that it was lacking was the gravy was too sweet. Could have been a lot more better if they could make this savoury dish a little more spicy...

4) Parathas - Plain Parathas were cute and small in size and so you have to make sure to order more if u are ordering the food from here... Triangle size...

5) Angoori Gulab Jamun - 6 mini pieces of gulab jamun. The sizes were very small as it was angoori gulab jamun. Finished the dessert within no time. Service was quick and in time..."
4,"Masala Kitchen

This is a Delivery Kitchen that's specialize in North Indian and South Indian Cuisine.
One of the best thing that they keep posting about the food until they deliver you on your door step. This helps to track your order.
Prompt delivery and leak proof packing.

Had some lipsmacking food from this place...
We Ordered:
Mangalorean Sukha Chicken Tangdi: This was incredibly delicious and went well with Butter Naan..
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

Khade Masale Ka Murg:
Quite settle taste. The gravy is smooth in taste and no disturbance from khada masala.. Goes well with Roti & Rice
Can try!

Butter Chicken Biryani:
The creamy texture from butter chicken masala just lifted the taste of the biryani.
If you like mild biryani taste and don't wanna opt. For too spicy biryani then this one is for you.
Can Try!

Dessert: Moong Dal Halwa:
The taste is absolute divine with the Oozing goodness from ghee.
If they would have mad it to Caramel brown halwa. This would have been heavenly good.
Can Try!

The prices of the menu appeared perfect for the quality, Hygiene & quantity of the Food!
What a beautiful experience that they serve all of that comfort food.
Worth ordering!
I recommend this place!!"
4,"Today I had ordered my dinner from Masala Kitchen which is a delivery outlet located in worli.
The food was delivered on time hot and fresh.
I had ordered:
1. Chicken Tikka biryani: it was very less and as it was small portion. Only two chicken Tikka pieces were there. The biryani taste was ohk ohk. Not that great. It costed 200 rupees and for that small portion it was way too costly.
2. Chicken Gilafi Seekh: it was yumm!! Best dish! N worth the money. It was cooked Soo well and topped with cheese. They could have added a bit more cheese. But it was great anyways.
3. Make your own meal gravy combo: it consists of butter chicken, roti, salad. N roti was Soo soft. Not at all hard or burnt. Relli impressed! The butter chicken was flavorful and tasty. It had enough boneless chicken pieces. Salad was also good.
3. Moong dal halwa: it was not at all good. It was made in dalda which is not at all healthy and tasty. It was very very dry. I didn't like the taste at all. Halwa should alwys be made in ghee. Not at all recommended here.
Overall I loved the food. It was good. I had given special instructions not to make it too oily or too spicy and they prepared it accordingly. Good!"
4,"Masala Kitchen is one of the few good delivery options for Indian food in SoBo. Their packaging is neat and spill-proof; delivery is well on time. I tried the following items:

Salli Boti Bun Muska: this is a Parsi dish which I liked quite a lot. Very succulent salli boti stuffing inside the classic bun muska.

Murg Gilafi Seekh: I love seekh kebabs, though I didn't quite like this one due to overload of ginger.

Khade Masale ka Murg: a rich, medium spicy chicken gravy dish which I loved. Went well with butter rotis. Chicken chunks were quite tender and juicy.

Hyderabadi Mutton Dum Biryani: This was the best dish out of all. Loved the aromatic biryani with soft and delicious mutton pieces. Well balanced on spice.

Jalebi Rabri: Perfect end to a hearty meal with crispy jalebi and creamy rabri.

They had also provided mint chutney, raita and salad with the order. Thumbs up for that. Definitely gonna try out more items from the menu in future."
5,"We had Sadya at Just Kerala and it was served on a banana leaf, offers a wholesome vegetarian feast with vibrant curries and pickles. Each dish was perfectly spiced and complemented the traditional Kerala rice. It was a wholesome and delightful experience!"
5,Visited for the Vishu Sadhya that's available. Very well organised lunch. Delicious food. There is also an option to add a couple of non veg dishes like pothichoru for an extra charge.
5,"If you're craving authentic Kerala cuisine, Just Kerala Restaurant is a must-visit. Their Kerala Thali is the highlight ‚Äî a hearty spread of traditional dishes served on a banana leaf, bursting with flavors and spices. From the tangy sambar to the creamy avial and perfectly spiced fish curry (optional), every element reflects the rich culinary heritage of Kerala. The service is warm, and the ambiance is simple yet welcoming. A perfect spot for a soulful, satisfying meal."
5,Starting with the appetizers we started with chicken 65 and omg the taste is amazinggggg you will not regret ordering it and the main course we had was obviously Kerala parotta and chicken Malabar curry they actually serve you authentic Keralite food and when you take a bite of the parotta and the curry together while it‚Äôs hot the feeling you will have in your mouth I cannot explain only you can experience the ambience is peaceful would definitely recommend if you planning to visit Just Kerala do visit don‚Äôt give a second thought you won‚Äôt be disappointed
5,"The place speaks for itself just as the name is. The entrance the vibes are all things Kerala. The menu is very authentic. We ordered the Kerala sadya which was like pls carry two stomachs with you if you want to do justice to it. The vegetables , the pickles the sweets are all have finger licking to the last morsel. The buttermilk at the end is a must to digest all that food !
Last but not the least, they were a full house when we visited them but the warmth and energy with which all the staff received and served us was real !"
4,This is an excellent mid segment business hotel close to the international airport. Well connected by metro and easy access to all business districts. Decent rooms and very good restaurants. Staff are very courteous and customer centric. Only flaw was the noice from the road on lower floors as well as you could hear people talking outside the room constantly . Otherwise great place for your business or personal visits
3,"Friendly service and nice ambiance but not so good food. A few items sent me to the toilet on 2 different visits (one was after a buffet and the earlier one I cannot remember what I ate) during my stay at the hotel in November 2021.

Sandwiches are their safest food item."
4,"Decent place. Decent rooms. Nice location , close to sahar airport and metro station"
5,Awesome place and great taste... Amazing service too... Very nice ambience and beautifully managed...
5,This hotel is very good services
4,"Good vegetarian options.
I enjoyed Karnataka Kara Dosa.
Even Masala Uttapam was yummy..
Chutnies are little bland.
Service is quick.
South Indian coffee is superb ."
4,I tried Ghee masala dosa and idli. Both were good but sambhar was missing south indian taste and so was it's coconut chutney which was also watery. Rest was all good. Service was excellent. Atmosphere was very noisy due to its very busy location close to Ville Parle West railway station.
5,"Loved my experience here! The food quality is simply top-notch, complemented by warm and friendly service. The ambience is perfect for a relaxing meal. Plus, it's so close to the airport, which is a big bonus for travelers like me. Adding to all this, the good food fragrances tantalize the taste buds. A well-deserved 5-star rating from my end. Do try for yourselves, you won't be disappointed."
5,Excellent place to stay. Staff are superb and love customers. So concerned staff. God bless all
1,"Extremely disappointing experience! We visit this place regularly, but today was the worst. Lassi was overly salty and completely inedible. The food was wasted, and shockingly, no staff member bothered to check or taste it. The quality has dropped significantly, and customer service was indifferent. We won‚Äôt be returning!"
3,This shop has now shifted to another shop in the same building. Years back Monginis used to have all the items on the shelf and two persons manning the counters but now it is a different story. No customers and empty shelf. There is one middle aged lady I see with curly hair whose face looks as if she is mourning and one who is not interested in customers but is in her own world.
5,Cakes and snacks are fresh and they take party order also I have taken chicken Patrice it was juicy and tasty .......
5,Wide range of variety available. Seating area not provided. But they are friendly enough to provide space to celebrate birthday outside the place.
5,"The evergreen cake shop, is still my go-to preference for cakes and bakery goods, in this area. The factory-made food items feel fresh throughout the day and standard quality. The quality of cakes and baked goods is much better than the competition that has newly popped up in recent years. Monginis only loses out on their marketing, but the legacy and feel of the brand is still in tact after so many years."
1,Monginis has tasty cakes and pastries but never try this chocolava cake... It's horrible
4,"The best Chinese Food experience so far. Much much better than Mainland China. A wee bit expensive, but you won't complain once you have tasted the food. Nice ambience with complimentary Green Tea.
Keep it up China 1.

A Happy & Satisfied customer,
Sandeep"
5,Ccccvj be there at less than an hour to get to know you better and I will be enjoying the weather and the other one is a very good and I will be enjoying the weather and
5,Exceptional food very good service
4,Authentic food and great ambiance
4,Superb quality food
4,"They have good pizza usually, but sometimes they tend to make mistakes. Like once they forgot to put cheese in my cheese burst. But otherwise their quality is consistent and the pizzas are tasty."
3,"The food is good here but it was better earlier. We ordered Fiery Chicken and Makhanwala chicken non veg pizzas and BBQ chicken wings. The Chicken Wings were good but very small.  Same with pizzas. Though the taste of the Pizza was good but we were little disappointed. They used chicken Salaami pieces instead of the tandoor chicken pieces. That didn't taste great. The outlet is small to accommodate only few people as they focus more on delivery and take-away. Service is not bad. We got the pizzas on time. The manager is also friendly and helpful. As there are lot of competition in the market, Smokin Joe's need to gear up and do but extra to be a level up."
4,"Liked the Tandoori Paneer pizza wasn‚Äôt very spicy but still was good at taste.
Supreme and California pizza were ok not at all spicy.
The thing that I liked was it wasn‚Äôt very dry.
Ordered thin crust assuming the base would be crispy which wasn‚Äôt."
1,"Ordered a large 5 pepper Fiesta with 3 cheese base, regular tandoori paneer with jalepeno with 3 cheese base and, on the order taking girl's recommendation, garlic bread with cheese

Ordered at 7.15pm and received delivery at 8.50pm, after 1 hour 35 minutes. Order was delivered cold. The 3 cheese base being the only saving grace (it was slightly warm).

Garlic bread with cheese was the worst, it was cold and difficult to bite (rubbery) you can find better at any road side sandwhich-wala

Recommendation:
1. AVOID THIS OUTLET if you are looking for fast and hot pizza
2. Don't even think about ordering sides"
4,"The pizza was really awesome and delicious. The dough was freshly baked and the butter quantity was also good.
We ordered Butter Chicken, Chicken Tikka & Tandoori Paneer"
5,"Randomly walked into this place after a long day at work.
Trust me, the place is so beautiful, and for aesthetics it'll be a 10/10 even by the strictest yardstick.

I ordered a bruschetta and a chocolate mud cake cutting. Excellently prepared. Quick service. I'd rate the food 10/10 on most days.
Absolutely light on the pocket.

Was a delight to speak to the manager of the  place. A very warm and welcoming place.

Keep up the good work guys!

(Also, pictures that I clicked are not that great, excuse me for that)üòã"
5,"Amazing Burgers at pocket friendly rates. Do try their Crunchy Paneer Burger. I've been having burgers since 5 years and the taste hasn't changed a bit.

We also tried Pizza like Sandwich which was Okay."
5,"This place is near vile parle station east. It is great if you want to have pizza, pasta, burger etc. They have opened a small good food cafe opposite to this outlet.
.
I have been here many times. But this time many new dishes were added.
.
I ordered -
.
1) Patani Paneer wrap - This is a wrap you wouldn't want to miss if you love paneer. The gravy in which the paneer is marinated is awesome.
.
2) Tex mex pizza - This pizza is for spicy lovers. Tangy taste with little spiciness makes it a great choice.
.
3) White sauce Arrabbiata pasta - White penne pasta. Nothing can go wrong with white sauce pasta :) awesome cheesy and creamy pasta.
.
4) Hummus falafel pizza - This was a new pizza. I love the concept of hummus and falafel on pizza. Loved the flavours, sauces, falafel and presentation. I would again go back for this pizza as it is combination of hummus falafel and pizza. :) :D
.
5) Nimbu soda - It was refreshing and chill drink."
5,"The Good Food Co. is a household name from Santacruz to Andheri serving delectable and pocket friendly caf√© for the last 10 years. TGFC has now launched a delicious new range of rice bowls, burgers and sides. Do try their new fantastic menu.

Recently I have tried the following items.

Cheesy Corn Balls

Beetroot Hummus with Pita Bread

Simple Vego Burger

This place is reasonably priced. The packaging was really good and food came before time.

They impressed me with their food. I am sure for lunch or dinner I would definitely order from this place.

P.S: This review is strictly depending on my personal experience.

5,"Nimantran serves one of the best Gujarati Thalis I've ever had! The food was absolutely delicious, and the staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming. The entire experience was delightful, and I‚Äôm already looking forward to coming back just for the food. Highly recommend for anyone craving authentic Gujarati flavors!"
4,"A Small, but Very Good, Airconditioned, Neat & Clean Specialty Restaurant which is a part of the Popular Hotel Parle International just outside the Railway Station in Vile Parle East, that serves only Authentic Unlimited Gujarati Thali, both for Lunch and Dinner as well. Parking can be a Challenge here, but the Hotel Watchman generally makes some space nearby, so it is not really an issue. The Restaurant is Nicely Furnished, the Spread is Quite Exhaustive, all Items are Freshly Prepared & served Fire Hot and the Service is Good as well. They have a Washroom too, which is situated in the Main Hotel and can be accessed from the Corridor outside the Restaurant. The Rates are Very Reasonable as well, making it a Very Good Value for Money place.
A Good Restaurant to go to, if you are looking for a Sumptuous, Authentic Unlimited Gujarati Thali with a Good Spread in the Vile Parle Area and Quite Popular as well. Definitely Worth Visiting and Well Recommended too."
5,"Gujarati Thali is really nice. You can have 3sabhji,dal rice/kadhi khichdi,2 sweets,chhas,papad,farasan etc. we have searched it on Google and found gujrati taste which is really fine, dinner thali at rs.375 unlimited. Staff is also nice. Overall good options for gujrati food. It near to juhu gulmahor road."
5,Food was good. Wait staff were very nice and quick. Ambience was nice and quiet for a weekend. I couldn‚Äôt help but notice that we get better gujarati thali in Texas and at a (relatively) lower price.
3,Average pure veg thaali. Spread is good.
5,"We went to look for another place for Marathi Thali near by but that place was shut down. Thank god this place was near by and it was what an experience. Especially young owner explaining the difference of Thali and Selection on Menu Main Dishes. My elder brother who hard likes spicy food but this place splendid indeed.

We are base in Hong Kong and hope we visit in Mumbai soon and try this place soon.
Good luck  and kind wishes to Owner and Staffs working for this Establishment.

Its a 2 Star place, do not expect much of Modern Conviences but its true what Marathi MALWANI Food is YUMMY."
5,"If Michelin gave stars for pure flavour (and ignored fancy lighting), Malwani Aswad would have at least three.

Ambience? Let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs so basic, IKEA would walk out. But the food? OH. MY. MALWAN. It‚Äôs a masterclass in the KISS principle - Keep It Simple, Silly, and they execute it to perfection.

No frills, no fluff, just full-on flavour bombs. Authentic, fresh, and unapologetically Malwani. The clam thali is my holy grail, the kombdi vade is pure comfort, and the bombil fry could bring a tear to a grown man‚Äôs eye.

Pro tip: Avoid the ready-to-fry crab lollipop (you‚Äôll thank me later) and just dive into any thali. You‚Äôll leave with a full stomach and a happy soul.

Malwani Aswad isn‚Äôt here to impress your Instagram. It‚Äôs here to feed you right. And it does that like a boss."
5,Excellent food and service. Fish fry and Bheja fry were incredible!!
5,"This place is amazing.  It might be small,  but serves delicious authentic malvani food. We ordered fried bombil, surmai thali, and few other dishes and everyone loved their food! The sol kadi was bomb! Highly recommend üëå"
5,"Don't expect much of ambience but you will be in for a treat in terms of food quality. Best authentic taste. Too good seafood.
We had surmai thali, prawns tava fry, halwa fry, crab thali and more. Each item had a next level taste and was pretty reasonable too"
5,"When I visit Mc Donald's it's always a nostalgic memory, in this world of fusion and innovation it feels good to come to a place where you want to have that old burger that you craved during your college days and it's simple the taste is decent not great but the overall experience is just wonderful"
5,"Overcrowded, have to wait for seat.
AC was not cold enough.
Burger taste and price both are awesome.
Their softy cone ice cream also nice to try"
4,"The burgers from McDonald's never disappoint!
Whether it's their classic Big Mac or a mouthwatering spicy chicken, the quality and taste are consistently top-notch. And paired with the Lotus Biscoff Frappe, it's a match made in fast-food heaven.

I tried this for the first time,The creamy, indulgent frappe with hints of caramelized Biscoff biscuits perfectly complements the savory goodness of the burgers.

It's a delightful treat that  hits the spot, making any mealtime a satisfying experience."
4,"It a spacious place. Walkable distance of 7-10 minutes from Vile Parle station.

Usually you will have college student hanging out at the place. Has birthday celebration room for kids and two wheeler can be parked right in front of the restaurant."
4,It a really good ambience food outlet and the service is also good. I enjoyed the day with my friend and had a little hangout.
3,"Its a decent place to catch up with someone (near to the railway station if you head off soon after) or if you need to catch a meal before you flight from the Domestic Airport (its literally 7 mins away). A laid back restro-cafe downstairs and a restro-bar upstairs. Drinks are only served upstairs I guess. They do Have Happy Hours and other offers every once a while. The immediate street outsie is a vegetabl/fruit market, So you might wanna be mindful of the company you get here."
5,"""Strenght - Ambience & bar Weakness - food quantity n quality variety""
""Amazing experience...lovely music...lovely atmosphere !""
""Good people, good ambience, Good food and lovely location."""
3,"Bit dim lit.
You can request to turn down the volume.
The food is good.
Tried Keema Pav, Veg. Kurchan, Gazali Kabab, Pasta in Alfredo sauce and Dirty Martini."
4,Great place for bachelors and couples....Great food good ambience cool live music!! Sports fans can enjoy live matches...Food has great variety and is really tasty!! Drink options are also good. Groups can have real good times at dinner!!
4,Awesome place. Depending on your mood you can either eat at the ground floor with music or the first floor with a more quiet ambience. Good selection of drinks. Really good food options.
1,"Most of the time we order through Swiggy/zomato, however today me and my wife had been to this place whereby after looking at the ice cream my toddler just wanted to taste a small spoon from the counter (post taking away our parcel). The owner denied flat on my face. This is the worst experience ever faced and was told ‚ÄúWhy am I arguing‚Äù. The owner doesn‚Äôt have a heart‚Ä¶!! And I will always remember that my toddler left the ice cream parlour crying. Hope he gets his karma someday"
5,"Awesome place to have Ice cream !!
Sancha ice cream is very famous
Very old and popular Ice cream shop in Mumbai....
There are many branches of Apsara Ice cream across Mumbai

Each and every flavour Ice cream is amazing"
4,"All the flavours r soo natural n tasty
Its peru is a must try it tastes exactly like the peru fruit specially with masala on top
Freshly made waffle cones are also tasty"
4,Ordered for the first time from Apsara icecream through uber eats. Ordered their brownie icecream flavour nd it was amazing. My whole family liked it. Yummilicious icecream with a creamy flavour nd soft texture. And also the icecream did not melt a little bit also during the arrival nd also after the arrival. Must try their icecream whenever near by or through uber eats.
5,"It was amazing earlier but recently I had ordered for some brownie ice cream rolls and the guy preparing it spoilt the roll it didn't look like a roll it looked like a triangle and I didn't even feel like eating the ice cream after that.Damn the ice creams are so great in it. Their menu is pretty wide. It's nor the same old tradition ice you will get. There are more than that. Be it the ice cream roll waffles or smoke ice cream. And the taste is without any doubt is perfect.Amazing icecream had a blast eating it and also how is was made was a feast to eyes n camera.One must try there blueberry icecream, red velvet cheese cake and death by chocolate frozen blast. Seeing anyone eat smokey biscuits is fun and a must try too.  Having a icecream craving or a sweat tooth should surely visit the outlet. Also very nice and cooperative staff."
1,"Worst Experience Ever!
I recently ordered from Domino's and
was completely shocked by the quality.
The food was stale and tasted like it had
been sitting out for hours. The pizza was
cold, the crust was hard, and the
toppings felt dry and old. On top of that,
the outlet was not clean at all--it looked
unhygienic and poorly maintained.
Absolutely unacceptable for a reputed
brand like Domino's. This was not just
disappointing-it was disgusting. "" I
never order from thiS outlet again, and /
suggest others think twice before doing
so. Quality and hygiene have hit rock
bottom."
1,The place is so unhygenic and the staff is very unfriendly. Would recommend dominos to take this feedback seriously and take corrective action.
1,"This place is extremely unhygenic
All chairs are messy ,walls have wierd and uncomfortable pictures which spoil the mood for eating  flies are observed all around the tables and food i bet you will feel pukish after you look at the cieling  proof  in photos attached
Owner does not pay attention to hygiene"
1,"The food was bad, i had food poisoning because of it. Highly recommend you to not visit this outlet. The staff is clueless about the new items in the menu, the ambience is bad, AC doesn‚Äôt work, staff doesn‚Äôt even clean your table properly, overall its a shabby place. No wonder i got sick after eating from there."
3,"Domino's pizza is on road side easily seen,from inside is Good neat & clean but at entrance there is no steps to climb there is slope that to rough there is no rod you can hold climb up. Small place with 4 tables only each table has 4 chair sitting.
Today there was 99 rs Masala pizza we took Kheema Do Pyaza Pizza& Achari Do Pyaza . It's was ok but Kheema was not good at all the taste it was not fresh kheema in it black pepper. I felt bit uneasy also."
3,"Its a good restaurant on the way to Hyderabad for charging our electric vehicle and have lunch by the time. Good washrooms. Price is on a higher side!
Plenty if parking space."
5,Been a timeless favorite for its reasonable prices and food quality.
1,"Pathetic condition of this bar with sick service. Staff not interested in serving. Got to know that chinese is not prepared in this bar but outsourced from nearby Gurudaya restaurant. Also no tandoor nor fish items, but charges are high. No value for money, it's clear cheating in the name of bar and restaurant. Should avoid and look out for others joints nearby. Please avoid such bars."
4,"If you are looking for a bar for drinks at Andheri (E) at JB Nagar at a budget price this is the best bar in nearby. Don't expect great at food, but okay to sit and enjoy drinks. This bar comes with small area and some time public non smoker may face inconvenience. Average ambience."
2,"Nothing special about this bar, very ordinary countryside bar type. Sitting out is a nice option as it feels choking inside when it's full. Average pricing, but food is below average. I wouldn't dream of eating a full course after drinks. Starters are still okay and nothing to carry home. Cleaners would also need to do their job better here!"
4,"I had been to this place Food Search quite a few times and was never disappointed with the food. We had ordered for Chicken Crispy, Tandoori Roti, Murg Pahadi Kabab Masala and a bottle of Thumbs up. On the whole a good experience.
Few reasons to deduct 1 Star is even while we were sitting in the Air conditioned seating yet we couldn't feel the usage. Secondly the tandoori roti was not that upto the mark.
Previously we had tried Chicken Adraki Kabab Masala that was too good to be true.
Location wise this is situated right opposite Surya Hospital behind the bus stop.
The location looks a bit shady considering it to be regular Bar."
5,"This is a male dominated quarter bar. If you manage your expectations well, you'll have an awesome time. Get to know the staff and they'll give you better service and attention than most posh restaurants. Couples might not be comfortable. Groups with ladies go to the family section on top. External appearances and the approach might look shady, but in this area this is an awesomely modest, safe and fun quarter bar to frequent."
2,Good if you are a large noisy crowd yourself and don't mind crude language around you. Food is ok and liquor flows as you order. Staff is friendly and service quick. Warning: After 12 am they allow smoking inside so unless you are a big fan of smoke circling around you better push off before 12. I go frankly because my friends drag me there.
5,Good place to visit
4,I have been here a number of times with friends. Mainly a bar very popular for those who like quarter system drinking. Wide choice of drinks available. Starters are awesome and delicious main course available too. Service is prompt and customer friendly.
2,"It is very near to vile parle railway station. However, it isn't that professional. There are mosquitoes around. You cannot go in short dresses because they are going to eat you up while you eat your food. The food items were stale and not fresh.

There are very few places to sit. It's not neat and very tidy. It's okayish to eat in a budget. The vehicle are parked right there, where you eat.

Pizza and cheese garlic bread are also stale. ‡§™‡§æ‡§µ ‡§≠‡§æ‡§ú‡•Ä seemed as if it was cooked like a week ago. There can be a lot of improvement with regards to hygiene, cleanliness and food. :)"
5,Delicious Food with reasonable Rates üòã. Nearby from Vile Parle station. A small joint. Spacious. What else ...yum food. Little slow in service need to wait for 15-20 mins for dishes you order
5,Excellent menu with mouth watering dishes. Best ever white pasta. Going there since 5 years. Even all veggie pizza üçï is best. One of my favourite VEG CLUB SANDWITHCH WITH LOTS OF Russian salad.
1,I want to give zero star if possible. The quantity is very very less. They give only two spoon of bhaji and their medium pizza is just 6 inch and taste is very bad as well. If you ever by mistake go to this place order a burger as it is the only decent thing in the menu.Disappointed.
4,"If you are super hungry with limited cash, try this place. Few of their dishes are very nice like mysore cheese dosa and pasta. Could be little neat and clean though. I liked their service. It was fast and very efficient, this a quick and cheap EATS place."
5,"I highly recommend Food Point for authentic Maharashtrian pure veg cuisine, rating it 4.5/5 stars! This hidden gem serves scrumptious dishes from breakfast to dinner, showcasing the best of Maharashtra's flavors. While there's no seating arrangement (stand-and-eat only)but the exceptional taste, quality ingredients. Must-try for Maharashtrian food lovers - don't miss their signature dishes!"
4,"Reasonable and TASTY üòã food , decent kitchen,

5,The quality and taste of sabudana khichadi was good
3,Paneer Paratha without Paneer and insufficient quantity of food for 140 rupees.
5,It offers delicious snack Items. Place is flooded with office crowd during lunch time. Best part is that the shop itself along with the food they serve is very hygenic. The menu includes a variety of items. It also has a friendly and convivial staff. Overall its a nice place in a good location and a calm environment.
3,"Situated inside the athiti hotel, the restaurant had a strange smell and looked worn out. We  arrived before before the dinner crowd so we were able to get our food pretty quickly. Note food is either prepared in ghee or sunflower oil. If you want cheap eats and still enjoy your food this is he spot. We ordered chicken Tikka , naan, vegetable puloa and two drinks. All for about 1100 inr."

5,Good Hotel. Attended seminar on 15.11.13
4,"Went to this tastefully decorated restaurant in Ibis  near the domestic airport! It‚Äôs a great place with clean washrooms and a pleasant courteous staff! However as you enter the ladies are taken to their cloakroom for a security check ... amongst loads of bags! Ridiculous

Food was spot on with the burger being tasty and delicious! We had ordered their chicken burger served with fries ! Perfect !
The cappuccino was hot and as usual just right!
Gets them a 5/5
Yet when we ordered the bacon sandwich they offered brown bread instead of the multi grain on the menu! That was a minus as well
But It‚Äôs the security detail amongst the vip bags, the safaris or the American tourister  , the soft and hard luggage that brings them back to a 4 rating! No way to treat ladies!
They serve buffers too during dinner but I recommend that you drop in for a snack and coffee"
5,"Love Food. Love good Mood - This is Spice it all about. Situated at Hotel Ibis Santacruz, a nice vibrant place with a good feel and ambiance. All new menus curated. Being a 4 star Property the prices for 2 approx would be around 1200/+ which is Real VFM. Had a chance to visit this place last week and here is what we had -

Skipped the Soup, Opted for Cafe (Quick Bites) along with my Beer. MASKA BUN, all time favourite had a bit of a twist. Hot that spicy hit of the crunchy Bhujia. Overall the Bun was soft with a generous portion of butter. Lovely sheen and tasted good.

Bullet Chilli chicken - semi dry with scallions. Diced pieces of chicken with bell pepper / onions tossed in soy/garlic sauce. Looked nice. Bold flavours. Gave that spicy touch. Overall good.

This place is known for its MOMOS and presented in a Tiffin box - 3 each (2 layer Tiffin) with 3 dips. PAN FRIED CHICKEN MOMOS - could have been better. Maybe a tad. Minced chicken with spices. Had a nice texture though. Chef, maybe less stuffing and this can be batter (just a suggestion)

Chur Chur Paratha. This is so Delhi. Crunchy Paratha with different types of filling. Here the chef has used Aloo Pyaaz/Gobi and methi matter. Just a suggestion as it gets a bit messy when all the 3 are served together. Served with Dal Makhani was yum (lovely texture) and Raita. Anytime for Dal Makhani. This is comfort food.

Phulka Soft Tacos with peri peri soya - again a good spicy tangy dish presented well. Veg consisted of Chilli Kidney beans Minced soya (had a good texture) Yellow cheddar (sharpness) and vegetables. Overall a nice dish.

Do try the Super meals (meal by itself) priced at 429/+ Consisted on Dal fry, Steamed rice condiments like Crushed Papad/Raita/Cilantro/Aachar/Lemon/Chilli and carrot pickle. Presented in Tiffin.

Dessert - Rasmalai Panna cotta (Missed the Ras malai touch) set well, could have been better, however the molten chocolate with vanilla Ice cream was good baked well.

Overall - This place has a lot of potential if marketed well. USP = Price. Ambiance is good. Comfort food. Will be back for sure, till then cheers."
5,"Spice It located at IBIS near the Santacruz Airport, is the hotels all day diner.

The serve buffet meals as well as a la carte meals. The buffet spread is very good with option  in live counters .

The service is good and the buffets are priced quite well .

Definitely a place to visit again and again"
5,"Desert options were less in Buffet. Taste was ok. Need more variety compare to prices. Rest all good.
Also they charge you separate for parking which is very weird. People coming for lunch and Dinner will definitely come by car and you need to keep parking space for free as the location is very much near to high way."
5,"It was an amazing experience. Although the variety was not much, the food's quality and taste made up for it. It was totally worth the price. Rohit and Ekta served us humbly with love. Starters were very yummy. The texture of the sabzis was perfect. Great job with the naan/roti as well. Everything was fresh and top notch. Desserts could have more options though. Another suggestion would be to include any 1 or 2 basic juices/drinks in the buffet. Overall it was a seemless experience for us. A solid 7/10 üëå"
4,"The Hub, is first mall to come up at far suburb of Mumbai. It has more to offer to its customers. At basement you have Big Bazaar, ground floor has MacD, Balaji restaurants plus movie ticket window. Upper floors has Vijay sales and other shops. Top floor is of multiplex. The mall is always crowded due to surrounded area is of commercial establishments and residentials too. People come from nearby suburbs and enjoys shopping and leisure too."

5,"We had a great late lunch today at the Red Grill Restaurant despite coming at the closing hours. One of the employees named ""Joseph"" gave us very warm welcome. He instantly took our food order  and sent to the kitchen. Staff like him must be noticed by the Manager/ employer so that such person can be encouraged in the days to come."
1,"We headed to this place today to have lunch! One of the worst place to be! We had to go to this place as there was no good restaurants near by! After hearing it only we came to know that this place is under renovation but still they manage to drag the customers inside by telling that the restaurant is moved to the basement! The way to reach there looks like a haunted place. The place was totally empty so we thought our order might reach on time! To ordered two starters and two rice items! They took almost 45 minutes to bring the order. They said Fish Tikka will take time to get ready so we asked him to give fish fingers instead of Fish Tikka and ordered one Sheekh Kabab! But to our suprise they brought all three starters together along with two rice course. When asked about the third starter they said they prepared they cannot cancel but we said we haven't ordered it why to force it on us! He said he will pack and give we told we are traveling we cannot take it but he wasn't ready to reason all he had to tell is that he can pack it up for us! Taste is also not up to the price! Fist used in Fish fingers smelled like it is very old!

I will never recommend anyone to this place! Poor service they will not listen to your requirement but will being something and will force you to pay for it!"

3,Very good food. Okayish ambience. Slow service
4,"I‚Äôve been to many restaurants, but this one truly stands out as the best. From the moment we arrived, the service was impeccable, with friendly and professional staff making us feel welcome. The food was absolutely phenomenal‚Äîeach dish was thoughtfully prepared with high-quality ingredients. I had the rack of lamb, which was cooked to absolute perfection, and my partner had the seafood pasta, which was packed with incredible flavors. The desserts were equally amazing, and we left feeling completely satisfied. If you‚Äôre looking for a restaurant that delivers on every level, look no further!"
5,"Mabruk, Sahara Star.

The place has an amazing ambience with comfortable seating arrangements, palm trees and water body flowing besides the restaurant, they actually resemble an Oasis.

coming to the food we tried: -

üí• Falafel is deep fried balls made with chick peas and broad beans with tahina. The balls were perfectly golden fried and tasted amazing. It is Egyptian dish originated in Egypt but is famous through our Western Asia.

Dessert.

Baklava: - Baklava is rich dessert pastry made made of layers filo filled with pistachios and sweetened together with honey. The baklava was so delicious and tempting, a perfect end to your meal.

Overall, Mabruk is an amazing place to try some authentic middle eastern cuisine. The service is also quick and the person who was I‚Äôm charge of our table, Neeraj was also excellent.

Much recommended üòÉüëå"
5,"It was our anniversary and we decided to dine with a slightly different cuisine as compared to the usual Indian, Chinese etc. We liked the ambiance, the service and oh the food was so so good. We had the hot and cold mezzo platter, the meat platter and some refreshing mocktails which left us feeling so satisfied at the end of the meal. We enjoyed our time spent there, the staff were so courteous and we relished ending our meal with the famous baklava. I highly recommend this place to all. Its amazing and so is the food üç≤"
5,"It's a very classy restaurant, quality food ,nice atmosphere, excellent service. Loved to be here ."
5,"Mabruk is a Lebanese restaurant in Sahara Star amd recommended for all if they have a liking for Lebanese food. It‚Äôs one of the old restaurants but the taste and originality is still that great and authentic. The hummus, pita bread and falafel here are great. In case you are a non vegetarian then the shish touk is a great choice. Sheesha is also very good quality and herbal. Staff is extremely attentive, polite and courteous. You can enjoy a good relaxing dinner here along with the beautiful View of the hotel and the water by the restaurant. Must for anyone who like to have good meal - a little bit high on budget though. Will require spending 2000 plus each person is what I believe but nevertheless enjoyable"

Quality of food is 5 star

1,"We‚Äôve been regular visitors to Orchid Hotel, but this recent experience with the midnight buffet was quite disappointing. Instead of being held at the usual Boulevard restaurant, it was arranged on the ground floor in a small, uninspiring space that completely ruined the atmosphere. The dull ambience and cramped setup didn‚Äôt reflect the standards of a 5-star hotel. We were told the buffet would include both continental and North Indian cuisine, but it mostly consisted of basic North Indian dishes with very limited continental options. The taste was underwhelming, and overall, it wasn‚Äôt worth the price. As loyal guests, we were truly let down and are now reconsidering future visits."
5,"Boulevard is one of the famous restaurant since ages. Orchid can be easily said to be one of the best ecotel hotel since years. Buffet of them had really lot of options. View from the restaurant is excellent too. Certainly a must visit restaurant if you want to enjoy the lavish spread. Strongly recommend, go for it.

Location- This restaurant is on the first floor of very famous ecotel hotel Orchid. Orchid is just adjacent to the domestic airport.(5/5)

Theme- Being the main restaurant of the hotel it's 24*7, it serves mix cuisine with a la carte and buffet both.(5/5)

Ambience- one side of first floor is occupied by this restaurant so yes it's really big. Divided into small sections. You can get a lobby view from any table.  One side of restaurant they got lovely spreaded buffet . Lighting is bright n fresh. Got mix tables or 2,4,8 covers. Soft music at background was nice.(5/5)

Food- This being a main restaurant of the hotel, it is open 24*7. You either can go for a la carte menu or decide to go with the lavish buffet spread. We decided to hog on buffet which looked really impressive.  Buffet consist of soup, salads, farsaan,starters, Chaat counter, main courses, desserts.(5/5)

Soup was the first dish I tastes and was highly impressive with the taste of it. It was seafood clear soup which was made with fish stock, fish chunks, thick sliced celery. Great way to start.
Chaat counter had various options like seven Puri, dahi Puri, dahi wada, bhel. You have to order your dish to the chef who was standing on the counter and he will send it to your table.
I had a go at dahi Puri which was delicious.

Starters they had paneer Tikka, corn bruschetta, fish fingers, chicken in Asian style. Fish finger was the dish I kept eating for long, fresh fish and crispy enough.

Salad counter had mix of veg and nonveg salads, loved the smoked salmon salad and tuna potato salad.
Very rare that I saw a farsaan options in multicuisine restaurant of 5*. They were serving bakerwadi and khokla, I didn't try it though was looking tempting.
Same section had options of nachos with in-house cheese sauce.

Main course really had many options. Pasta  live counter seemed very busy. I opted for more Indian food as awadhi gosht korma caught my attention. Excellent colour with medium thickness gravy and well cooked lamb in it was heaven with the butter naan (any bread options you like) which they serve on table.
Dishes like Pan seared fish with garlic cilantro butter sauce, chicken in black bean sauce were a must try.
Coming to rice , I saw Chicken biryani  first time itself when was checking the buffet. So took biryani with some for a gravy. Biryani was well made with long grain rice, garnished well with fried onions and had extraordinary aroma of it's own, Enjoyed it.

Dessert section is always said to be the best part of any buffet, it's true. Here they had mix if Indian and continental desserts. Had dark chocolate mousse, kiwi mousse, peach apricot jelly, Chocolate mud cake , strawberry salsa with caramel mousse etc. Had ice cream options along with black current Halwa and kesari kheer."
5,"My first visit to the ORCHID restaurant was shortly after it reopened after the lockdown, and the assortment of food was amazing. There is no better breakfast, brunch, or dinner buffet in town than that at The Boulevard. Dessert and chat are undoubtedly the best parts of their buffet. The buffet is highly recommended. Both the food and the atmosphere are excellent. All staff members are courteous and helpful."
5,A wonderful place with lots and lots of variety food available for vegetarians and non vegetarians. It has a buffet system for main course and desserts. Moreover the snacks are mouth watering and yummy too. Food is delicious and worth every penny spent. Ambience is beautiful with courteous staff.
5,"A first for us, visiting a premium whisky lounge. Although I‚Äôm not a fan of whisky this place was so appealing I had to visit! Situated inside The Orchid Hotel near Mumbai Airport this place is a delight for whisky lovers with more than 99 premium whisky brands in their bar.

This place gives of a little bit futuristic neon vibes with pink and light blue colours dominating the decor. With the bar on one end and tables across the floor this place is as good as it gets.

They even host live music every now and then, please check with the lounge before visiting. Their drinks section is quite huge with a menu as extensive as it can be. There‚Äôs a liquor or cocktail for everyone!

The service is also super fast, staff is very courteous and helpful in guiding through the menu. The dish presentation is also quite neat. Our food was on the table within a few minutes of ordering.

Coming to the food we had a few cocktails and a few veg and non veg starters. The cocktails were really good, they were strong punchy and had a good flavour. Same for the food the starters were really good. Overall we had a really great time!"
3,"The first thing that stands out about this lounge is its impressive collection of 99 different types of whiskeys. If you're a whiskey connoisseur, then Merlin's 99 Whiskey Lounge is definitely worth a visit. However, even if you're not a whiskey aficionado, you're bound to appreciate the inviting and calming atmosphere of the lounge.

Merlin's 99 Whiskey Lounge also offers live music, adding to the relaxing vibe of the place. Whether you're looking to unwind after a long day at work or simply enjoy a night out with friends, this lounge is the perfect spot to do so.

Moving on to the food, we had the pleasure of trying their paneer zaffrani tikka, chicken bhuna roll, and chicken tikka pizza. All three dishes were delicious and packed with flavor. The paneer zaffrani tikka was particularly outstanding, with succulent pieces of paneer marinated in a fragrant mix of spices. The chicken bhuna roll and chicken tikka pizza were also top-notch, with generous portions of tender chicken and mouth-watering spices.

The cocktails and mocktails at Merlin's 99 Whiskey Lounge are a must-try. The mixologists here are skilled at crafting unique and creative drinks that perfectly complement the food. Whether you're in the mood for a classic cocktail or something a little more adventurous, the drinks menu at this lounge has something for everyone.

Finally, the service at Merlin's 99 Whiskey Lounge is impeccable. The staff is friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. They are always happy to recommend dishes and drinks that suit your taste preferences.

Overall, Merlin's 99 Whiskey Lounge is a fantastic spot to enjoy a night out with friends or a romantic evening with your significant other. The live music, impressive whiskey collection, delicious food, and creative drinks make for an unforgettable experience."
5,"Merlins Karaoke Bar is one of the best karaoke bars in town. It has 99+ whisky options to try out from. This place has a very rich ambience. The service is quite good. Many cocktail and mocktail options to try out from. A good munching starter is available here. It is inside the Orchid Hotel in Vile Parle. The dishes and drinks I tried here were:

1) New York Sour : A rich whisky sour with amazing flavours, must try.

2) Cinderella Mocktail : A mocktail made up of pineapple and orange juice. It had an amazing presentation and taste.

3) Fish Fingers : A perfect snack to munch in with the drinks. Fish fingers were perfectly cooked and served with french fries.

4) Chicken Tikka : The traditional and ever lasting chicken tikka served with green chutney and salad. Just perfect.

It was truly a mind blowing experience visiting here. I highly recommend visiting this place once with your buddies."
5,"I visited Merlin's Karaoke Bar this weekend with my better half and here I am sharing my experience.

The lounge is located in the 5 star premium property of The Orchid Hotels near Mumbai Airport.

Starting with the ambience. The interiors are eye catching with a comfy couch and lounge chair seating.

The bar is mesmerizing and they serve 99 kinds of Whiskeys. They have a wide spread of options in the Cocktail Menu.

We were attended by Jay and Allen. They were kind and served us with warm hospitality. The service was prompt and they helped us well to decide drinks and starters as per our taste buds.

We started our night with Rob Roy which was a whiskey based cocktail. Just how I like it.

My partner tried their bartender special LIIT which was made with a mix of different white spirits with a twist of cranberry juice and beer.

We started our meal with Cheesy Mutton Seekh Kebab and Malai Chicken Tikka. Both the starters were marinated and grilled to perfection and complimented well with the green chutney.

In mains we loved Extravaganza Pizza. It was a thin crust pizza topped with exotic veggies and mozzarella cheese.

You can enjoy IPL or any sports matches with your partner along with drinks and appetizers here.

They have Live Gigs and Karaoke throughout

Warm hospitality, crafty cocktails and mouth watering appetizers.. couldn't ask for me.

It was a lovely experience for me and my partner. Will surely visit again very soon."
5,"If you enjoy whisky, you must visit this establishment.  The karaoke establishment inside the Orchid Hotel in Vile Parle East is called Merlin's.  This location has a wonderful atmosphere and the sitting is ideal.  They also have a unique beverage counter.  There are more than 99 options accessible if you say whisky.
The best feature of this location is the live music and singing performances.  People become automatically indulged in the surroundings as a result. The food was absolutely delicious and came in a variety of forms.
We experimented.
Murgh Tikka/Malian Zafrani
2. Chicken quesadillas
Chicken Pakoda, third
4. Chicken rolls from Bhuna
Chicken Nuggets, no. 5

beverages 1. Red cider
1. Cinderella
Negroni Mezcal Daiquiri

They also provide incredibly fast service.  This place is incredible."
1,"We had no other option, so we decided to eat here. After waiting for 20 minutes, we finally got our food. However, the hygiene standards were extremely poor‚Äîtables and chairs looked nice in design but were not cleaned properly. We even spotted a #cockroach under the table.

Unfortunately, the next day, we fell seriously ill with food poisoning. This was a terrible experience. We urge Pizza Hut to prioritize hygiene and thoroughly check their kitchen before serving food to customers."
1,"I write this review to spread awareness for consumer rights. I don't live in india and was traveling from Mumbai to another country. I used my international bank card. When you do that anywhere else you can pay after you select the currency of the payment, which by law is a decision the customer has to make. On the other hand a guy who was taking orders here, didn‚Äôt let me do it and was pretty sly as he chose the options very quickly and did the transaction before i could even react and then was just very cool about it. Things like this makes it harder for us Indians living abroad believe in the country again. This is a small issue but you get to know lot of the values of people here and how everybody is just ready to scam you. The employee name is Aadil ji, seems like he is the manager here. Good hire pizza hut! Am never coming back to this establishment again"
5,"izza Hut is a taste sensation! Their menu offers a fantastic variety of options that cater to every craving. From their mouthwatering pizzas to delectable garlic bread, every bite is pure satisfaction. The flavors are divine, the ingredients are fresh, and the quality is impeccable. Pizza Hut truly knows how to deliver an outstanding dining experience."

The staff of the hotel n the staff and chef of Chinese Inc, the chinese restaurant went out of their way to accommodate us though it was almost closing time.
They made us comfortable n served us our food and also made some special kids menu for my grandniece m grand nephew.
The food was delicious. The sticky fried rice, the chef suggested was excellent.

A big thanks to the staff of the hotel, the staff n chef of the chinese restaurant.  U really made us feel special.
Thank you once again. We really appreciate what you did for us.üôè"
5,"CHINA INC AT Taj Santa Cruz - Dragonboat festival. Mind blowing
Started on 22nd June till 2nd July . SICHUAN AND CANTONESE at its best
Chef has curated a balanced menu veg and non veg which has flavours , balance , umami taste , texture sheen . Overall satisfaction.
Though Sichuan is spicy they have balanced it so well one does not get the spice hit
Almost tried small portions of half of the MENU hence going in detail would be difficult but highlighting some star dishes
Dimsum - Truffle flavoured Carrot was amazing , thin layer minced carrot melt in mouth . Also try the Zhonghi (veg and non veg ) lotus leaf sticky rice served hot and XO perfumed fish Shumai. Fragrance all over thin layer stuffed with fish

Spiced cucumber salad or Sichuan giang huang hua is simple salad loaded with flavours ( a bit spicy ) lovely presentation

STAR DISH : Huaiyang style marble tea eggs . Look at the texture ( pic uploaded ) braised eggs infused with herbs and Chinese tea

Crispy Okra is an amazing dish if one is an okra fan. Simple tossed with aromatic chilli mix

Mains : Steamed salmon with pungent bean sauce . Light soft . Polished in a minute
Shredded chicken fresh chilli with Xhaoxing sauce , simple yet flavours did the trick
Mopu tofu was done well as were the hakka noodles ( this is so Cantonese )
One should try the truffle braised noodles ( you can choose from veg / chicken ) pair it with Sichuan style mala fried rice

Must end with their 2 amazing desserts
Coconut sago pudding - Cantonese delicacy and last but not the least Jian dui ( outstanding ) the chocolate tea cup was heaven - placed over it was a perfect fried Cantonese pastry made out of rice flour coated with sesame sead

Not to forget the negroni and the gin based cocktail
AMBIANCE of this place has a dragon shape feel with a lovely hand blown (3800 approx ) blown glasses
Two PDR for private dining and a lovely and exclusive Bar area to unwind
Over all = kudos to team and the entire team of Taj And China Inc
Till we meet again , cheers"

I visited the place today. Mocktails & appetizers were amazing. The vegetable dumplings were unique. Mr Yogesh, the manager, offered me personalised services; the other servers were equally helpful and absolutely friendly. The main Course was average - I tasted some French Beans and Chicken. In the deserts, the Wasabi Cheese Case was fantastic.

Visit 3 [ Extract ]

Some of the dishes I had:

Duck [ in the main course, whose precise name I don't remember ] - Unusually strong on species, very much unauthentic, some pieces covered almost entirely in bones, and tough to chew upon. Call it a botched preparation and mood spoiler! It's not very often that I leave behind any dish. The grievance was resolved amicably.

Pork baos - You don't get these in many same-level restaurants, so a must-try. On a sweeter side and minced well and soft to consume. Arrived in the estimated time.

The quantity for all the dishes was above average and probably the largest I have seen at same-level restaurants.

Visit 4

A supreme and unforgettable experience

Some of the dishes I tried:

Traditional Pecking Duck - A conventional Chinese dish which is usually served with pancakes, troika of sauces, some veggies, and ofcourse, the duck cuts. Kudos to the chef, on my request, for serving me ready-made and saving me all the effort. The dish was slightly on the sweeter side, and the rolls had a good proportion of duck. Much laborious to scoff if all constituents are served separately.

Steamed Chilean Sea Bass - Prepared in soya ginger sauce, lightly spicy, mildly¬† pungent, and medium in size. Delicious, healthy and a must try. Maybe a few veggies at the side should be considered.

Light Breeze mocktail - Indeed light, mild soda, simple as it gets. Kinda like virgin mojito less Sprite/7UP and less coriander.

Grapefruit-based mocktail - the best of the three, authentic grapefruit flavour with medium bitterness, preserving the original taste, no soda.

Watermelon-based mocktail - another light one with no soda, pure watermelon [ and no syrup ] and a dash of cucumber.

I would like to thank Mr Jojo for preparing tailor-made off-the-menu [ above-mentioned ] mocktails, all of which were served inside 10 mins.¬†And not to forget, offering me cashews which were off-the-menu. At the end, he also made an exception and served me the desserts from another restaurant because I didn't want any from the menu courtesy to various reasons.

This is amongst the handful of restaurants in this range where almost all the dishes are available in small and large sizes, and this allows one to make better selections on quantity. To add to that, even small sizes are equivalent to medium in many dishes. If I were to offer a suggestion, it would be to rejig the currently-mediocre dessert menu and add dishes like creme brulee, coconut pudding and cheese cake. On the embellishments front, I would say the restaurant is slightly behind despite the fact that they have a Chinese dragon hanging from the top & and a plush red carpet albeit the latter doesn't cover the flooring of the whole restaurant . The pots don't look very attractive and there is room for vibrance - a few paintings & art pieces could help. The restaurant size is quite big with 10+ tables.

It was also nice to meet & have an interlocution with Mr Srinivas, and I would like to thank him for personally overseeing the dinner and ensuring that it was a memorable experience. It is recherche of someone of his level to come down and discuss the ways certain past flaws were handled and briefing on the feedback taken to minimise the bitter moments; I really appreciate this commitment.

I am looking forward to visiting here again soon."
5,"Ambience and Food merit a Four
But Rahul our server was so knowledgeable and courteous that he turned the four to a five!
He practically knew all the ingredients that went into each dish and turned the dining experience into a culinary adventure
Pineapple goes into the sweet and sour prawns... and the bean curd was tofu!
The dessert was devoid of sugar and sugar free additives as well, the taste totally from chocolate apricot and a hint of rosemary!
The ceiling turned out to be a dragon ... and though they must have been tired at the end of the day the staff were pleasant, caring,  helpful throughout"
5,Very very good food. Would not expect anything less from the Taj. The team were very very good also. The ambience is good even though it is a closed space. It is definitely more than a tad expensive especially considering this pretty much an airport hotel for Taj. The sliced fish was very well made and the clear wanton soup was distinctly different.
4,"The ambience is excellent. And as far as hospitality goes, the Taj is impeccable. However, we had a few highs and lows.
We chose to go for the √Ä la carte menu.
The highs - the Gremolata prawns and slow cooked lamb chops were excellent. The pork skewers were fine. The Italian white wine was excellent.
The lows - the deconstructed Tiramisu, however, was quite bad. The Prosecco poured for us was flat. On pointing it out, the staff did replace the drink. Just that one doesn't expect this at a Taj fine dine.
However, the warmth and hospitality covered the flaws. Overall, an expensive experience."
5,"Italian Fine Dining Restaurant at
Taj Santacruz.
Classy Ambiance.
We tried their vegetarian dishes .

Cappuccino - good
Iced Americano - very good .

Rivea Signature Pizza -very good .
Spaghetti Algio e Olio with Edamame - good.
Burrata Salad - good.
Truffle Fagottini pasta - very good .

Desserts
Flaming Chocolate Brownie-
excellent .
Sicilian Ice Cream Cake - excellent .

Service was bit slow but extremely courteous. The server dropped a slice of pizza by mistake so they immediately offered us a complimentary mini pizza which was much appreciated."
5,"Where hospitality is taken to a new-level

My fourth visit to this French / Mediterranean restaurant was filled with fantastic delights, crafted dishes, amazing interactions, and sweet surprises throughout the dinner.

We were warmly welcomed at the restaurant by head chef, Mr Minocha, who named a few specialities and why they deserved consideration, and wow! -- all of them were outstanding; more on that, later. In a few minutes of our arrival, we were served complimentary kiwi mocktails, which had a high-powered soda and were mildly sweet; it didn't take long for the team to catch our taste buds for mocktails. We ordered a blueberry-based mocktail and a mango lassi, and both were authentic. The former was reasonably sweet with a significant amount of fruit % made with medium-power soda, whilst the latter had a rich % of alphonso mango [ and not concentrate ] content, unlike other same-level places where mango lassi is likely to have more of concentrate and yoghurt %.

Till the time the main course was getting ready, we were served a small plate -- Avvolto Avocado -- which was a small, soft roll containing mashed avocado with a dash of jalapeno flavour. In Pizzas, we were recommended Truffle tartufo, and gosh! The smell has started doing the talking and managed to dominate our sensations. The arugula was a skosh scratchy on the tongue, but that could easily be kept aside without affecting the taste of the pizza; it could not supersede the rich parmesan spread on the crispy layers. Next came the soups, and the chef had to do some convincing; I ain't someone who has much liking for soups. But the chef had won here; his nice smile had words written all over it. If the aroma wouldn't be all over one, then just a sip would send one in an Elysian mood. The porcini cream soup with its truffle foam, which looked like a cappuccino, was creamy and so delicious that I could keep having it.

And now came the main course -- Pan-seared Chilean Sea Bass and Lobster. The former was arguably the best I have had hitherto; A medium-sized portion served with sauteed veggies and mashed potatoes alongside, it was perfectly cooked and easy to slice that I couldn't help but scoff it quickly. If one weren't to mince for words, no words would really describe the taste; one would have to nosh it to feel it. Meanwhile, we ordered a cranberry-based mocktail, and as per our instructions, it was mildly sweet with medium-power soda; this was notable given that mocktails which are significantly or entirely cranberry-based cannot be kept away from high sweetness. And this was just another example of scrupulousness from the restaurant.

In the desserts, we were treated to a De-constructed Tiramisu, a famous Italian dish. Having a different presentation and girded by lady fingers and creme and chocolate cuts on top, it had a rich coffee texture and was brownish and spongier than the ones I have had in same-level restaurants. The size was small. The Classical-flavoured Cannoli with three flavours was a roll filled with flavoured, reasonably sweet creme, albeit one of the flavours was insipid, and possibly a change of flavours would find more takers. The chef agreed to my request to replace the original ice cream, and the chocolate ice cream [ sans almonds ] was delicious and made up for the cannolis. The size was large overall. Another off-the-menu dessert, whose name I have forgotten, which was offered to us, too, was a chocolate-based dessert whose layer was artistically molten by liquid chocolate to form a crater. It was delightful too.

Throughout our dinner, Mr Lopes and his teammates were around to ensure that our requirements were looked after, and satisfyingly so, and we were given notable suggestions from time to time; we enjoyed our chat with everyone, in particular, Mr Lopes. It was also nice to catch up with Mr Minocha earlier. I would also like to thank Mr Srinivas for personally looking into the reservation. We bid adieu to the restaurant with a nice photo with the chef & team."
1,Very poor quality dessert... Just looked fancy but the quality of ingredients used was below average. Please do not try the flaming chocolate brownie it tasted like sugar with compound chocolate and costs INR 1125. Complete rip off.
5,"I had the most amazing food last night here. Was not sure what to have but chef Sumil just asked the preference to me me and served  a good 7 course meal to us. The food was amaazingly tasty, the plating was fabulous and the ambiance was great. Its perfect for date. All the meal came on time ,Thanks to Rizwan who was there to do so. Once again thank you Sumil and Rizwan for making our day with great food and great service."
4,"Tiqri, the 5-star hotel restaurant, offers an overall experience that leaves room for improvement. While the atmosphere exudes a pleasant ambiance, providing a comfortable setting for patrons, the culinary and service aspects fall short of the high expectations set by the premium pricing.

The food, unfortunately, only attains a level of mediocrity, lacking the wow factor one anticipates from a top-tier establishment. The menu may benefit from a more innovative approach and attention to detail in execution to match the restaurant‚Äôs upscale positioning. Similarly, the service, while adequate, doesn‚Äôt quite reach the excellence expected at this price point. Promptness, attentiveness, and a personalized touch could elevate the dining experience significantly.

Given the premium charges, there‚Äôs a clear expectation for a flawless fusion of exceptional cuisine and impeccable service. Enhancing these aspects could undoubtedly motivate clients to revisit, fostering customer loyalty. Tiqri has the potential to be a standout dining destination, but a concerted effort to elevate both the culinary offerings and service standards is essential to fully realize this potential and ensure a memorable and rewarding dining experience for its clientele."
5,"""A hidden gem with a cozy ambiance and great food. The service was quick, and the staff was friendly. The menu had a good variety, and everything we ordered was fresh and flavorful. Prices were reasonable for the quality. Would definitely recommend for a casual meal or a special occasion!"""
1,"It seems this place is asking people to leave fake 5-star reviews and positive comments in exchange for money. This raises serious concerns about the authenticity of their ratings and the integrity of their business practices. Genuine reviews should reflect real experiences, not paid promotions.‚Äù"
5,"One of the most beautiful restaurant I have ever been to. Staff hospitality was on show.
Kind, warm, welcoming and generous staff. The interiors are made from the best of best quality. And have been designed with  designs known. The tables are beautifully designed.
The quality is top notch when it comes to hospitality and management. All the chefs are so good at what they prepare. Amazing and delicious food.
Overall experience is wonderful üòä"
4,"Located inside Taj Santacruz it‚Äôs known for its buffet spread. Thus we decided to visit on a special occasion.
I liked the restaurant as it was illuminated by natural light and I always have a fascination for green structures.

The portrait of a large tree made of steel catches the attention as you get in the restaurant. The buffet spread is incredible and it had everything that I would have thought off. Complete value for money and if someone has huge appetite then it‚Äôs more than value for money üòÅ

The only suggestion would be to get rid of the small plastic bottle water and replace by glass bottles where patrons can pour water themselves saving unwanted wastage of water and reduce plastic footprint.

Definitely a great place to celebrate special occasion"
5,"Absolutely loved the authentic South Indian flavors at Shiv Sagar! The dosas were crispy, the sambar was perfectly spiced, and the tea hit just the right note. Clean ambiance, quick service, and great value for money. A must-visit for anyone craving true South Indian taste."
1,Falooda was worst ever tried here. Not recommended at all. Remaining food taste was okay okay. Serving food is ur self task.
4,"Shiv Sagar veg Restaurant ‚Äì Delicious Food with a Price Tag to Match

Shiv Sagar Restaurant is well-known for its delicious vegetarian offerings, and my experience was no different. The flavors were absolutely amazing, particularly in the veg main course dishes like the perfectly spiced Aloo Methi and the rich, flavorful Paneer Kolhapuri. For South Indian food lovers, the Udupi Masala Dosa was a delight, with a crispy texture and a tangy, authentic chutney pairing. The curd rice was another standout, served chilled and refreshing‚Äîa perfect way to end the meal.

However, the portion sizes left a bit to be desired. The quantity of food seemed to have been reduced, which was disappointing given the high prices. Paying ‚Çπ44 for a single tandoori roti and almost ‚Çπ400 for a veg main course in the non-AC section felt steep. While the food quality undoubtedly scores high, the pricing does take away some of the charm.

Pros:
‚Ä¢	Exceptional taste, especially the Aloo Methi and Paneer items .
‚Ä¢	South Indian specialties like Masala Dosa and curd rice are must-tries.
‚Ä¢	Quick and efficient service.

Cons:
‚Ä¢	Pricey for a non-AC vegetarian dining experience.
‚Ä¢	Smaller portion sizes compared to the cost.

Overall Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (4/5)

Shiv Sagar Restaurant delivers on flavor and variety but falls short when it comes to value for money. If you don‚Äôt mind spending a bit extra for great vegetarian food, it‚Äôs worth a visit!"
4,"Have been visiting this place for many decades now. However, this time, quality was a notch below par. Still pav bhajis are great to have at
this place. I have always tasted pav bhaji at this place so can not comment on other items. But pav bhaji is a must have at this place."
2,"Got a take away . Worst Pavbhaji in Mumbai. Just taste of tf tomatoes.
Pav was not even roasted. Ultra hyped place and totally avoidable.
Earlier their staff experience was so rude that out group left the place."
1,"The outlet sends stale pastries. I had ordered a Zebra Torte and two Devil's delight pastries. The sponge was dry and the cream was pale yellowish and foamy and so was the case with chocolate ganache of Devil's delight, it wasn't fresh. I had food infection after consuming it. I am disappointed as Monginis should make sure they send quality products."
5,"Courteous staff, very neat and clean. Good variety of cakes and pastries. Highly recommended for any kind of celebration. Character photo cakes, special made to order birthday cakes are available basis advance order. Good and reliable place to visit, very near to Parle East station and market area."
1,Worst cake I've ever had in my whole life. It was not fresh at all i suggest to not visit this shop.
5,"Amazing....
The cup cakes and cakes here are delicious. I can't stop eating them. They have a great service and nice employees who treat you politely. They deliver cakes on time to the venue. Would recommend"
5,"Nice delicious food and best service, i recommend you to visit once."
4,"They are ok.
The only reason I went here was I was hungry and wanted vegetarian food.
The channa batura that I ordered was ok. The channa was loaded with oil, I know it has oil but not like what they served.
They better change this too much oil.
The rates are high like any other restaurant inside an airport."
1,Pure veg and thinking good food I picked up veg Biryani. Shocking to see chole as side dish. Who on the earth gives chole as side dish. Taste of chole horrible. Pls stop fooling people. Raita was only water. Biryani taste average taste. Pls do justice for the money you take. If can‚Äôt pls stop fooling people.pappad you can fold not break. Stop taking people for a ride. Staff not even looking at guest to talk to them what they need .
1,Terrible Paratha of Paneer and looks like got served Frozen one
1,I have ordered Misal paw...which was very very salty...I hv exchanged it too to make with normal taste..but second time they have made same as before order.
5,"I found this shop near Gate 65 and 66 next to KFC and Pizza Hut. There is a garden ahead of this shop. So from the entry to departure side of airport take first left and walk ahead, then take a left another left crossing garden you walk ahead on the left is an array of shops where this shop is seen. Being morning time I ordered breakfast. Poha and water bottle.

Yummy food I tasted today. The order was placed in no time. Food arrived in no time. Yummy and very very tasty it was. The unique part of the restraunant is I found old phone, old typewriter, old books leaning against the pillar. The pillar is full of old Mumbai paintings. So if you are allotted gate 65,66 don‚Äôt miss this shop."
5,"One of the best places for authentic vada pav and misal pav! The vada was hot and crunchy with just the right amount of spice, and the misal was rich, flavorful, and satisfying. Great taste, fast service, and perfect for a quick bite."
1,"Had ordered 15 vada pav and 10 patti samosa morning in office today
The patti samosa were oily just check the pics and masala was also stale .
Disappointed with people who have big names and cheat us with quality ."
3,"I heard huge hype over it .
But it was below par quality with multiple variety of vada pav."
4,"Very good kotimbir vadi and also cheese burst vada pav.
There are 2 option
One just plain cheese on vada and other cheese üßÄburst where cheese filled vada is served in vada pav.
Overall taste is great and good experience."
5,"I recently visited this vadapav center. They've been around and loved for decades.
The vadapav served here has the freshest a as in the stretchy pav bread. The optional chutneys add the much sought after punch to the dish.
It's easy to understand what keeps the town running and why mumbaikars love their vadapav so much.
The place is large, corner building and clean."
5,"I received my fresh and hot pizza within 10 minutes, making it a great option to grab a quick bite before a flight. Domino's is located inside a food court with several other outlets, so there are plenty of choices available.

I ordered the Blazing Onion and Paprika pizza from their shortened menu, and at ‚Çπ255, it was reasonably priced, especially considering the typically high prices at airports. The pizza was satisfying and well-prepared, providing good value for a quick meal."
1,"Horrible service, most of the things were unavailable. I had ordered chicken wings and it was stale and almost still frozen unlike usual dominos. Many dishes were unavailable and the only things available were a couple of pizzas. Surprised a dominos can be this bad. Took about 35 minutes for just a pizza and roasted wings."
1,"Absolute scam. They said only meals available, no single pizzas. No menu available. The display doesn't change slides. Couldn't even buy a garlic bread. I was asked to purchase a full meal which I didn't have time nor the hunger to finish. What a scam. Guy at the counter was clueless and rude."
5,"Wouldn't typically have dominos, nor comment about it, but in this instance felt like I had to comment as the guys working Monday 16 December evening outdid themselves.

I ordered something quick, not noting the time, and was told it would be twenty minutes as it was the sixth order. Ten minutes in I realised it was later than I thought and I had to leave for my flight, and leave my actively coming pizza behind. I told them not to worry and to have it themselves or give it to someone else so not to waste and left.

Two minutes later one of the guys ran after me with a piping hot fresh pizza. Totally unnecessary, totally unexpected, but really kind. Literally better service than I got in my two nights at the St Regis hotel.

Thank you guys!"
1,"I don‚Äôt understand how is an outlet like dominos allowed to charge higher than their usual rates only because the shop is on an airport. Moreover, I‚Äôd rather have a store be closed than not have things I asked for to be available. I understand some things aren‚Äôt available but it‚Äôs a lot here. No regular size pizzas or meals available no garlic bread available. If you are keeping something open try and keep things available and at least at the rate you normally offer."
5,"Amazing place, the same quality and quantity as it was many years back. Fully loaded sandwiches, cheesy burger, fulfilling toast, delicious maggi and many more options with the best quality n affordable price. Now they have a well sitting place too. The staff is also very friendly and they do free home delivery nearby tnc applied. I would sure recommend this place for a evening snack with friends."
3,Good food and healthy food it's good for a small meal . I tried grill sandwiches and burger üçî.they were good .
1,"Pathetic Food
We ordered vegetable Maggie and we got half cooked tomato and onion Maggie which costs 105 bucks
The taste was not even worth for it"
5,"Very nice food (pasta) and friendly staff. Nice place for food. Recommend to all tourists as well. Price is fair, too =)"
4,"Have been eating from here since years!!
Their sandwiches, burgers and juices are too good.
They have a lot of other items too in the menu. First it was besides cycle store. Now, it has been shifted diagonally opposite in the same lane.
Too much student crowd in the lane because of coaching classes.

Great option for quick snacks!

What more can you ask for."
3,I visited this place 2 days back. The staff at the reception seemed to be quite new and confused about the menu and options. Another senior staff came to assist but seemed to be quite rude to the other staff. The food was fine and the ambience was ok
4,No need to review but their delivery service is good. Everything arrives hot in vile parle.
4,Quick service. Lovjoyleen very kindly filled up our water bottles for us on this so hot day! Thank you!
2,"Highly unprofessional stuff. Worst experience with the food, the milkshake was ü§Æ(it felt like someone had poured the softy in your glassü•∂). My friend who had a burger said the chicken was not fully cooked. McD Vile Parle East please level up and stop cutting corners."
5,"If you are looking for a place to relish delicious authetic mumbai delicacies like misal pav, look no further. Panshikar sweets and snacks is the place to be. It is easily accessible by any means of transportation. It is near the road. Hence parking is bit of an issue. The small shop makes seating also kind of cramped. But the flow is superfast. But this doesn't compromise the quality or the taste. The staff is quite quick and friendly.  The prices are quite reasonable. I tried their piyush ( the best i have ever tasted). It is so creamy and sweet and just yummy. Took parcel of misal pav n vada. We even took small packets of laddoo for prasad for nearby temples as well as small attar bottles. They are available on swiggy and zomato too. Packaging is perfect.
Definitely my go to place in Mumbai for authentic Maharashtrian delicacies."
4,"Stumbled across this eatery while looking for a lunch place. They had a Combo Meal Thali which was really nice, very authentic Maharashtrian aroma. The service was fast, and the staff was friendly.

Tried the most selling beverage, Piyush, which was delicious too. Not too sweet, and very tasty."
4,"The food was delicious especially srikhand was outstanding, but due to lesser service employees the service was little slower, else everything was fine, it's a must have lunch type restaurant üëç"
5,"You can test local Maharashtrian food here.
Food test is authentic traditional Marathi food.
It is just 11 minutes drive away from airport terminal 2 ( about 4.1 KM).
It is one of iconic maharashtrian outlet with branches across the Mumbai suburbs.

There is need to improve ambience.
Staff is very polite and  friendly."
2,"It is a traditional Marathi eatery, once it was very authentic and tasty, but as time passed they lost that approach towards food, now totally commercial. Marathi people still believe it belongs to their types, but second time they do not make it a choice. Great disappointment üòû"

If you love seafood, Gajalee is an absolute gem! The restaurant offers huge seating space with both AC and Non-AC sections, ensuring comfort for all. Plus, they have valet parking, so no worries about finding a spot. Being highway-connected makes it super convenient to reach.

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the star of the show ‚Äì the food! Every dish was mouth-watering and perfectly cooked. I was honestly impressed by how every single item we ordered turned out to be so delicious! The best part? They bring out raw fish for you to select‚Äîsuper fresh and a unique experience.

Here‚Äôs what I ordered:
‚Ä¢	Bombil Fry ‚Äì Crispy, light, and full of flavor
‚Ä¢	Prawns Gravy ‚Äì Rich, aromatic, and packed with fresh prawns
‚Ä¢	Neer Dosa ‚Äì Soft, thin, and the perfect complement to the gravy
‚Ä¢	King Fish Biryani ‚Äì Fragrant, flavorful, and a seafood twist to the classic biryani
‚Ä¢	Fish Kebab ‚Äì Juicy and grilled to perfection
‚Ä¢	Solkadhi ‚Äì Refreshing and the best way to end the meal

My bill was around ‚Çπ4000, and I must say, every penny was worth it! I highly recommend Gajalee to all seafood lovers. I‚Äôm already planning my next visit to try more dishes. Absolutely loved it!"
5,"Plump, juicy, and sweet crabs in smoky, spicy, and tangy Tandoori coating. Their Bombil Fry is one of the best. Some stuff is pricey but most things are amazingly delicious."
5,"Super fresh and delicious food.
Must try the bombil fry, solkadhi, crabs, prawns curry, neer dosa and caramel pudding.

They bring fresh crabs and fish to the table to choose before cooking, so it takes time to prepare the dish...but thats the price you pay for fresh and amazing food."
5,"Had walked into Gajalee (Vile Parle outlet) and it was a mouth-watering experience!

Each and every dish that we ordered was AMAZING! Starting from Bombil fry to Fish Tikka to Prawn Sukka - everything was cooked to Perfection! Neither under-cooked, nor over-cooked!
The Fish Tikka was slightly pricey at 1000 bucks!
Ordered Caramel Custard and it was quite sweet!
Service was okay - they frequently brought us wrong dish. They probably couldn‚Äôt manage the lunch hour rush!
The Restaurant is quite spacious with loads of seating capacity and is situated on the main road , so it‚Äôs not difficult to find!
Will come back for more!"

5,"Curry and Pasta Kitchen and Bar in Vile Parle offers an inviting and vibrant ambiance that combines modern design with a cozy feel. The interiors are likely designed with a blend of contemporary d√©cor, warm lighting, and comfortable seating arrangements.

As for the food, the mocktails are refreshing and creatively crafted.The appetizers like Bali chicken and cigars are known for their tasty and well-seasoned fillings, providing a good balance of crunch and savory flavors. The mushroom cheese balls offer a delightful combination of crispy exteriors with melted cheese.

In the main course, the Veg Manchurian showcases a classic Indo-Chinese touch with perfectly cooked vegetable balls in a flavorful, spicy gravy. The Murg Karra is likely a rich, spiced chicken dish that pairs excellently with butter naan.

The sizzling brownie with ice cream is a showstopper dessert.This place is a must-visit for those who enjoy a mix of Indian and international flavors."
5,"Curry & Pasta is an exellent restaurant of Parle International hotel, Vile parle east which offers an intriguing fusion of Italian and Indian cuisine, blending two beloved food traditions into a unique dining experience.

5,"Visiting India after 17 Years, and I was craving for Patti Samosa's. This place came highly recommended by my Bro-In-Law, who has been born and brought up in Vile Parle East, and I was not disappointed !!! Ordered Patti Samosa's, Batata Vada's - & - Kothimbir Vadi's. Samosa's had a filling of Green Peas + Onion, which had a good crunch, and the Batata Vada's as well as Kothimbir Vadi's were also Excellent ... I would definitely go there again to try out their Misal Paav. This definately, is the place for a Street Food Connoisseur like me !!!!"
5,"Most delicious Vadapao you will get here ..
but i personally love the Patti samosa

Whenever I crave for samosa I visit here

Samosa are small but delicious in the mumbai famous known it is

So do visit and
Keep munching üòã"

We had one but then it's taste we loved a lot and ended up ordering one each for the next round."

5,"Mad Over Donuts (MOD) is a true delight for donut lovers! Their donuts are fresh, soft, and come in a variety of innovative flavors, from classic chocolate to unique options like tiramisu and hazelnut. What makes them stand out is that their entire menu is 100% vegetarian, which is a big plus for those seeking eggless options. The ambiance is cozy and perfect for a quick snack or a sweet treat with friends. The staff is courteous and attentive, adding to the overall experience. Their pricing is reasonable for the quality, and they often have deals like 'Buy 6 Get 6' that make it even more tempting. Highly recommended for anyone with a sweet tooth!"
1,"We ordered Hazelnut Bliss with Nutella, but they served caramel crumbled, which they stated was a Hazelnut.Online customers are more important to them than those who visit their shop.Serving online orders was their primary focus."

MOD is the best place for donut place in town.
Food 5/5
Ambiance 4/5
Service 5/5"
2,"Crazy expensive. Starts at 125 per donut/item. I have had similar chocolate donuts for 30 rupees. Even 50-70 rupees per donut was somehow reasonable.

Edit: Well, as the MOD's response, sure they are not ""mass-produced"" but I've not witnessed any difference in quality between the two either. The 125-rupee chocolate donuts' qualities were just as par with 30-rupee ones. So as far as quality is concerned, it's not that impressive. Even my mother complained that her doughnut tasted like it had artificial colours. Tremendously disappointed, MOD Vile Parle."
5,"Best place for donuts. The ambience of this place is very welcoming and refreshing. You'll get fresh donuts here anytime of the day. This place is well known for donuts but they also serve cupcakes, cookies, waffles and coffee. The best seller and evergreen one is the double trouble donut."
3,"Tea Villa Caf√© in Vile Parle East is a charming little pink caf√©, just a 10-minute walk from the station. It's the perfect spot to chill and catch up on gossip with friends. I tried their sizzler and waffles with ice cream, and both were absolutely mouth-watering. A cozy vibe and great food make it a must-visit!"
4,"Just been there and the experience was lovely.

To begin with, the 'tea' in Tea Villa Cafe was fabulous. I ordered 'Maratha Tea' which had medicinal ingredients like ginger, pepper, nutmeg and cloves. I liked this tea so much that I ordered it twice. They offer you a range of sweeteners, which I personally liked. I didn't try their snacks, so I can't comment on that.

The thing I did not like was they only take cash payments. No UPI. I highly doubt anyone carries that much cash nowadays. But I think they are famous in localites and they must know this constraint. Washroom facility is clean. The view of outside traffic from table number 1 is nice. I was there for about half an hour and I liked every second of it. It's a chillax cafe which you want to be at, when you want to have some time for yourself."
4,"Surely recommend..
Lovely place to host celebrations ..
Reasonable price.. variety of food options‚Ä¶
Good decor‚Ä¶ decent service ‚Ä¶
Waffles are really scrumptious..
Suggestions : To increase brightness by adding more string lights
To choose better colour of banner
To reveal the complete arrangement before the payment"
3,"I recently dined at tea villa Vile parle east and was extremely disappointed with the level of hygiene in the washrooms. The floors were dirty and the toilet was not properly cleaned. To make matters worse, the waiter was incredibly rude when my friend ask her about washroom cleanliness she said that is not in use as our quests hardly use washroom here. She was in so much hurry to clean the table that she didn't even realised that my friend was still eating."
4,"We tried spaghetti and a couple of the asian cuisine dishes, and everything was quite good. The frappe was decent. Service is leisurely in keeping with the overall vibe of the cafe, but not annoyingly so.
Overall, a nice place to have good food and relax while working or with friends."
4,"For starters, the place was quite empty when I came here. Looks quite dingy at night. The staff is quite friendly and polite. I had ordered A veg Wanton soup (‚Çπ95), Crispy Chicken Honey Chilli (‚Çπ270) and Chicken Burnt Garlic Fried Rice but was served Veg Burnt Garlic Fried Rice (‚Çπ160).
The soup for starters was really good. Not too spicy and not too sweet! The starter was sweet like it was supposed to be and fried to perfection. The Fried Rice was a bit dry but I assume with some gravy it would have tasted really good. So the overall experience was nice.
Also, it's not ""pure veg"" as the name on google suggests."
5,"This is not a pure vegetarian place , they serve tasty Chinese non veg food"
5,Most tasty food I ever had. Quick delivery & hygiene place. The best is Spring Roll stuffed with sprouts.
4,Good Taste food for Chinese but price comparatively Quantity is very high.
5,The food is more than what i had expected .It's a place only if you want to eat 4 star Chinese food .
5,"""4.5/5 stars!

I recently visited the Barista Cafe located near Vile Parle East station, and I was impressed with the friendly staff and excellent food and beverage (FNB) service!

The cafe's ambiance was lively, but it was quite crowded, which limited our seating options.

Overall, I'd definitely recommend this Barista Cafe outlet for its warm hospitality and great FNB offerings. Just be prepared for a bustling atmosphere, especially during peak hours!

Will surely visit again!"""
3,This Barista...... serves u good coffee! The staff is good too. The main issue is the maintenance of this cafe. It's not clean and looks shabby.
2,"The barista at this location, Ms. Poonam, was unprofessional and rude when we inquired about the bill and beverage sizes. She became visibly frustrated, throwing a tantrum, and ultimately walked away from the cash counter, leaving us unattended. Her colleague had to step in to take over the conversation, and when we addressed the issue, he supported her behavior. This is not the experience I remember having with this barista in the past."
5,"I recently visited Barista in Vile Parle, and I must say it was a delightful experience. The manager, Santosh, and the friendly barista named Noor, provided exceptional service. The atmosphere inside the caf√© was inviting, and the outdoor seating area was quite pleasant, allowing for a great coffee-drinking experience.

What stood out to me was the excellent treatment of customers. It appears that this caf√© is under the management of Mr. Jigar, and his touch is evident in the welcoming ambiance and courteous staff. It's heartening to see such dedication to customer satisfaction.

As a regular Barista customer, I was truly impressed by my visit to this branch. I hope that Barista maintains this high-quality atmosphere in all their outlets in the future. Kudos to the team for making my coffee break a memorable one!

Atif Irani"
5,"Great ambiance, great staff and good food. I was here for a meeting so did not get to explore more of their food and beverage and settled for a red bull. But i have been to barista and have loved their egg and cheese croissant and signature barista blast cold coffee.

Cost : 500 for 2
5 mina walk from Ville Parle station."
5,This place is an hidden gem in mumbai they serve variety of food and drinks i tried their cheese burst vada which was at just ‚Çπ60/- and really it is worth the size of the vada was so big and then we tried their special melting cheese grilled sandwich at ‚Çπ240/- this sandwich is huge and lot of cheese filling into it i really felt so heavy within only 3 pieces of sandwich at the last i tried special oreo milkshake was so thick and crunchy . I really loved this outlet must visit ‚ù§Ô∏è
4,"Ice n rolls is located at JVPD scheme Juhu and it is a street food joint with a stall set up where you can stand and eat or order food in your car. There is a runner who gets the menu in the car and you can order the food. The place is street food hence don't judge it on the basis of hygiene. What is guaranteed here is tasty lip smacking food. We ordered for sandwich and the veg blast pizza. The pizza was extremely cheesy and yummy. The prices are inexpensive and the quantity is good. The service is super fast with quick order delivery. Overall a decent place to enjoy street snack items. This place is open till 1:30 am in the night. Must try!
#streetfood #snacks"
3,"Want to eat something past midnight?
This is the place to order from!
They do have a wide variety of options to choose from, taste of some of the items is great but some are just okay okay. It‚Äôs a road side place.
Ferraro milkshake is one thing you must not miss.
They have some jain special items too
Bread items are good. Pasta was okay.
Service is super fast. You can sit in your car and they will come and give you what you want."
5,"Oh you are near mithibai college in hurry but hungry? Why to worry than this outlet will fulfill your tummy's need with their delicious food like cheese burst vadapav,many type of shakes and many more....!"
4,"Had a mysore masala dosa , excellent it was! The variety in the menu is also too much... From pav bhaji to Pizza to Rolls to Dosa there's almost everything for every food craving. Don't resist, please visit!"
4,"Tried here Chicken Dum Biryani @ Rs 120/- In Bandra Side U Getting chicken biryani in Good restaurant its very reasonable price

Oil Quantity was lil bit high

Taste was the Biryani is below Average..
1/5

Price 5/5

Cleaning 4.5/5

Try Different items here Don't try dum biryani It Will Disappoint You.."
1,Very bad survice and packing and diliver so late it takes 1.30 hours to our food and very bad packing the oil is coming out of package and in ratiya they just put onion and tomato and water like curd soo bad
5,The Taste is great and very budget friendly also the service is fast and it is a underrated restaurant.
5,Good service and thali was best. Go for it.
3,I regularly call for a parcel of Kheema fry. Very tasty the typical chiliya green masala one with lots of dil (shepu)
3,"Too tiny space! Hardly suitable for 4 people. Most of this branch's business is only from Parcel.

And NO PARKING SPACE! Park vehicle at your fate.

However, Above points are manageable but what not is the POOR HYGIENE. Dirty floor , Flooded with water leaked from AC pipe. Unclean trash box and tables.

Prefer online delivery rather than in-store dining."
5,"We were getting late and it was 15th August ,rush was there . To our surprise the order was ready with minutes it was cheesy and quite good , the place was clean and the surrounding was very peaceful like you could even grab a last pizza and walk with you better half"
1,"They cancelled my order as there was no light in their outlet after 2 hours on my order no 40. Never ordering from here again.

30 mins guaranteed is just a lie.

It should be 2 hours Kai baad bhi ni batane wale kya hua.. Chal nikal.."
1,"Order No 130 placed today at 9:50 pm, and still wait for pizza. Bad Serviceüëéüëé.

I tried connecting multiple time to Pedderoad store, not single number working. Useless service"
5,"I used to study at a library in Peddar Road and Dominoes happened to be just around the corner. A perfect place to satisfy those junk cravings and enjoy a meal for yourself! A small tiny place with 3 tables, its perfect for a group of 2-3 people wanting to eat and catch up. I really love their farmhouse pizza with pan fresh base and accompanied with cheese dip for the extra yumm factor.
How do you like your Dominoes Pizza? Dine in or delivered to you?"
5,"Absolutely enjoyed the pav bhaji here. Very tasty and consistent over the past many years.

It's a different genre of pav bhaji all together,  one must experience .

They do justice to 'Amul' Pav bhaji. If you're a fan of Amul butter, you're going to love this.

Chatted up with the owner, was impressed to know that attention to detail has been the key for this joint over the years , for eg. the paav is specially sourced , rather than relying on the next door bakery.

Keep up the good work !"
1,"I recently visited Sardar to try their much-hyped Amul Pav Bhaji. While the dish was tasty and definitely rich in butter, I felt the place is quite overrated. The pricing is on the higher side for a simple street-style dish, and the menu is pretty limited if you're looking for variety. Overall, it's decent if you're in the mood for buttery pav bhaji, but the experience didn‚Äôt quite live up to the hype for me"
5,"I have been living in Mumbai all my life and I probably must be living under a rock to not know how popular this place is for PAV BHAJI.

Finally I tried it, and surely it‚Äôs worth the hype!!

How it tastes like: It has a very simple and light taste to it. Not very spicy (I like it spicy) but yet delicious and super buttery.

Must try at-least once or a lot more times. (Just know the place will always be packed with customers, no matter what day it is, it‚Äôs always very busy!!)"
3,This restaurant is overhyped for its quality of food served. The taste of Pavbhaji was similar to other restaurants. There is prominent taste of butter üßà. They add too much butter. Also the price is higher than others and its not worth the quality and quantity. Also the cost of extra pav was higher. There is no any facility for parking. Also there was waiting for 30-45 minutes.
4,"The iconic Sardar! The taste really is their USP,also they are very Frank with the amount of butter that goes in their Pavbhaji & Breads, haha! You'd be full in just two breads.
I specifically recommend Caramel Custard üçÆ, not too sweet ,not too soft, just the right amount! Soul soother!"
4,"Loved the experience of dining at Cafe New York.
1) The location is extremely beautiful where you can dine overlooking the busy life of Mumbai City yet there's peace.
2) The ambience is perfect.
3) Has a  chilled laid back atmosphere when we dined at this place could be different during rush hours.
4) The price for the quantity ratio is amazing.
5) Parking is a challenge paid parking available at a distance.
Must visit experience leaviyyou craving for another visit asap!!
Ordered Non Veg club Sandwich and Veg Biryani both of them were decent and filling for a person or two.
Fresh lime soda was a standout perfectly made."
4,"An amazing irani cafe in the charni road area, we came here after watching several reels and werent disappointed..

Mutton keema pav here is one of the best one tried in parsi cafes, very tasty 190/-

Next we had Akuri + toast which was very good too, it's basically anda bhurji on a toast
We loved the anda bhurji so much we ordered it separately again.

They open up very early and they serve alcohol as well.

It could get quite cramped in evening time and on weekends

They have a vintage jukebox which the owner was kind enough to give a free demo, it's cool to see such things still exist.

Would definitely recommend breakfast here ."
5,"I recently visited **Caf√© New York** at Dabholkar Building, and I must say‚Äîit‚Äôs a beautiful mix of nostalgia and flavor. From the moment I stepped in, the vintage charm of the Irani caf√©-style d√©cor instantly transported me to a bygone era, yet the place still carries a fresh and modern vibe.

I started with their *Kheema Pav*, which was an absolute standout‚Äîrich, spicy, and soul-satisfying. The *Akuri on Toast* had just the right blend of spice and creaminess, perfect for a hearty brunch. I was with a vegetarian friend who ordered the *Farmer‚Äôs Garden Lasagna*, and even I couldn‚Äôt resist a few bites‚Äîit was surprisingly wholesome and full of flavor. We also shared the *Cheese Chilli Toast*, which had the perfect crunch and kick.

The service was warm and attentive, though we did have to wait a bit during the lunch rush. That said, the staff made up for it with their cheerful demeanor. The upstairs NY Bar N Grill added a completely different feel‚Äîideal for an evening hangout.

Overall, Caf√© New York has earned its reputation. It‚Äôs not just a caf√©‚Äîit‚Äôs an experience that honors Mumbai‚Äôs culinary legacy with grace and flavor. Will definitely be going back!"
5,"Great classic cafe ‚Äî prices are reasonable, location is convenient, and they can even make the food according to your specifications. I especially loved the French toast and keema pav with egg. Service at these kinds of places is usually a weakness but it was outstanding! We‚Äôll be back!"
5,"Good place to hang out with Groups!
Try Cheese chilly üòã toast.

Chicken lollipop.
Kheema pav
Chicken crispy
Chicken Tikka
Mutton Rogan josh

It's yums üòã"
5,I once forgot my cross bag containing costly earphones here. They have kept it safely with them. üëçüèª
3,Just a very casual place to eat. Nothing fancy..
1,Test wise  price over value  h or ans bhi nhi dete customer ko
3,Very old time parsi run bar good for quick beer and food
3,This is a shady place. famous red light area went into bar for famous chicken sandwich. Great for bachelor don't stroll with your female friends in that area.
4,"This place is at walking distance from
central railway station, staff is very generous and service was good too, I didn't have to wait too much for my food after ordering. It was very quick and I was so happy as I had a train to catch and could have proper dinner"
3,"Food is ok. We had Pav bhaji and, Spring roll. Roll was too oily. Probably put in cold oil, else it was good. Pav bhaji was bit high on masala, but typically a Mumbai style one.

Seperate AC section. Right opposite Mumbai Central railway station. Best location to grab a quick bite."
3,This hotel is situated directly across from Mumbai Central Railway Station. üè®üöÇ  It offers purely vegetarian cuisine of high quality and excellent service. üåøüòã  Separate air-conditioned rooms are available. üè¢ü™´
4,Good food. Had special Biriyani. The hotel is near to Maratha Mandir and also the Mumbai central railway station.
4,I was searching for Veg Restaurant. I'm new in mumbai. I ate Ghee Masala Dosa and a Sweet lassi. The taste was amazing üòç and even I was getting the taste of ghee as well. But they gave me too sweet lassi.
1,"When I don't visit to Mumbai usually search on YouTube (Mumbai Street food), their are few videos who reccomend to visit Tibbs Frankie and enjoy their Frankie.
When I visit to enjoy their Frankie, it's totally tasteless (in simple word :- no taste at very high price).
I tired out Chicken Frankie which was totally tasteless. Chicken Frankie cost me Rs 120/- (or extra something with taxes), I recommend you please don't visit."
4,"Tibb's Frankie at Forjet Street.
A Frankie shop. Veg and non veg Frankies.
You get Curry Rice plate also.
Frankies as all know is very tasty and mouth watering.
It's a parcel counter only.
Cash and card payment accepted (last time when I went the card machine  was not working.
Happy hours are available every last Wednesday of the month."
2,"I specially searched for this store & with great expectations went personally & brought Tibbs Egg and Veg Frankie at Tradeo Mumbai store, utterly disappointed with its taste... Very bland & tasteless... Been eating this since 1994 at that time & till recently it had a great taste & freshness..."
2,I ordered chicken tawa Frankie which I have have alot about. But the taste was below average. I would rather recommend frankies near churchgate station which are cheaper and tastier. 184 for a frankie with below average taste is a big no. Get a subway instead of u need a brand value and taste.
1,Place is overhype bland food bland taste not worth it.
5,Really love it! I visit this restaurant whenever im visiting mumbai! The food and atmosphere and service everything is excellent! Also prices are very reasonable and food is very tasty! Must try gravy items and their special crispy chicken! Also respect the fact that they do not sell Israeli products anymore! Must visit place
4,"Decent restaurant, not bad nor super good but most probably acceptable to a large extent. U must try out the crispy chicken, it is one of the best crispy chicken I've ever had. And i am damn sure you'll also crave for it once you eat it. Its not expensive too, it's just normal. There are 3 types of seating:-
1) general seating without a.c
2) seating with a.c
3) dastarkhwan with a.c (seating on floor)

Also, the breakfast here is pretty good.

Overall, nice place to eat.

Here are some photos of Lunch, Dinner, and Breakfast."
4,A very decent option of having food near Mumbai Central Railway Station and Just opposite to Mumbai Central bus depot exit. Food here has a fine taste & good quantity moreover is pocket friendly. A quickie for non veg lovers before boarding in to a bus or train from Mumbai Central.
5,"My must have visit to this place whenever I am in Mumbai central. Just 2 minutes walk from the station. Food quality, taste, standards and hygiene all is perfect"
4,"The food quality is excellent for the last 3 years and I go there pretty frequently. This is what makes me doubt the reviews below.
The Gravies tend to have a sameness about them, but that basic gravy is very good. I would highly recommend the Prawn or Mutton Sukka, Wade, Khima, Bombil Fry and an unusual but outstanding Biryani."
5,"A-1 Fish Koliwada is nice place at Grant road west serves delicious North Indian, Malwani, Mughlai and Chinese food.

In starter i had Chicken Tandoori and paneer tikka.

Chicken tandooris presentation was good and its taste was awesome.

Paneer tikka was well prepared paneer was soft and its taste was good.

In mains i had Prawns fride rice and chicken fried rice.

Prawns fried rice was well prepared and was loaded with prawns which  satisfied my stomach.

Chicken fried rice was in good quantity and rice quality was good as well as taste.

Service was good.
Friendly and suggestive staff.

Highly recommended."
5,"The best Prawns Koliwada I've had. Period!
We ordered Prawns Koliwada(MID) that costed 375‚Çπ/quarter kg. There were almost 8-10 pieces. We also tried Surmai Fry, that costs almost ‚Çπ1500/kg. Pretty decent rate for the quality of sea food they offered. One of the pieces was slightly raw they quickly got it fixed. Courteous staff, quick service. Family seating hall was very spacious and comfortable. As soon as we entered they prompted us to sit in the family section which took me by surprise as I didn't know they had a separate section with really pretty decor hidden inside the main entrance. We ended our meal with Triple rice and Hakka noodles. Noodles was the traditional yellowish desi Chinese style, chicken was also fresh. Worth visiting. Definitely coming back just for those deep fried prawns!!"
1,"The place is very unclean. Ordered a chicken manchurian rice and the Food was uncooked, chicken was still red inside. Tandoori prawns were spicy however the prawns were stale.
The waiter serving in the ac area was extremely rude."
4,The food is nice here. Ambience is little bit uncomfortable but overall service and fish tandoori is the best.
2,"It‚Äôs okay, but it wasn‚Äôt fully tasty. I hope the quality improves so it will be really enjoyable."
5,"hello friends
one of the my fevrate place for misal pav and batata vadas......regularly i vist this place for food
everything was so maintain
staff also good
clean place
super tasty
simply love this place
üòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòò"
3,Tried Misal pav & lassi after 15 years at the same place. The taste has gone for toss. Nothing close to it. Lot of gravy and spicy too.
5,"I am visiting this place since childhood üòÉ and always love the food here, it tastes the same as it was 10 years ago. The service and staff is also good.üíØüíú"
5,"Special tea house is a small restaurant which gives a quaint feeling.

Reach there for breakfast early and u will find it full with ppl waiting to get inside

Ambience basic - food fantastic

The dosa was crispy and well made.

The coconut chutney had a hint of sweetness which was different and i loved it The sambhar was good.

The medu wadas were also superb.

The service was lightening quick and the place felt hygenic.

The filter coffee was perfect. One sip is enuf to make your day amazing.

Special tea house is surely a special place to be."
5,"I had vada sambar,  puri and tea. The food is great and the price is fair.

The sambar is not like what we get in south India, but it‚Äôs still better compared to a lot of the options in the city.

Tagged on my map. Will visit often."

4,"Visited May 2025.
Had been meaning to come here for years! Had Chicken Sheek (Rs 100 for 2) and Mutton Sheek (Rs 200 for 2) with Tandori Roti (Rs 20). Quite tasty and not too spicy - just the way I like it. But after all the rave reviews, bit of a let down, perhaps i was expecting too much ;-) Place is reasonable clean. Will visit again, Masoor Pulav next. Pics attached.

EDIT : Had Masoor Pulav (Rs 130) on my second visit. As ggod as the sheeks. Again, not very spicy. There's kheema below the pulav rice BTW. Pics attached.

EDIT 2 : Bheja Masala Fry (Rs 250). Very tasty and cooked perfectly. The bheja was buttery. As always, be aware of the dangers of consuming brain. Pics attached."
3,"I visited this place on the weekend.

The place has an old vibe to it.

The food is strictly average nothing extraordinary. People have unnecessarily hyped it up.

We had ordered:
1) seekh kebab
2) Irani seekh
3) Chicken Seekh
4) Paratha
5) Tandoori Roti

The seekh kebab was okayish. Irani seekh was tasteless and blend, only chicken seekh was good but nothing extraordinary in taste.

Paratha was oily and tasted weird. Tandoori roti was the only good thing.

Didn't try any other things after the kebabs and was disappointed.

There are many other places one can visit for kebabs this place is average."
4,It was in my list since a long time. Went here when i was near the area. Its an old school irani cafe kind of seating and gives a lovely vibe with an old mumbai charm. We ordered seekh kebabs which were too soft and yumm. Mutton masala and tandoori roti was also good. Would love to try keema next time. Hero was seekh kebabs.
3,"Visited after a very long time and it's still pretty much the same as before, except that they now have an ac dining room. Ordered the following
Mutton seekh kebab 4/5
Same taste no change at all.
Buff seekh kebab 5/5
Even better than the mutton version. Tender and melt in the mouth. Definitely order this If you eat buff meat.
Paratha 4/5
Hot and flaky. A must have with seekh kebabs. Not for those who hate oily stuff!
Mutton masala 3.5/5
Average dish, but wanted to try something different here besides the seekh kebabs hence ordered.
Tandoor roti 3.5/5
A mixture of grains and pulses, taste is different.
Mutton paya 3.5/5
The soup is delicious hence ordered it, paya pieces were okay.
Mutton biryani 2.5/5
Never had biryani here so ordered to try. Would not recommend it either, as it's pretty below par.
Caramel custard 3/5
It's actually a chinagrass pudding with caramel, so have it strictly as a novelty sweet.

Service was pretty fast but the waiters are hard to get hold of as they are not many to service tables and take parcel order's, which keep coming thick and fast.  The ambience is also just the same as before, the only change is that they now accept UPI payment.

I'd definitely visit again, if only for the buff seekh kebabs & parathas."
1,First taste is the last taste
4,Nice

2,
5,"This is a small shop  but  beautiful ambiance , where you‚Äôll get cakes , pastries & bakery items.. Pastries are yummy & good quality.
#must try pastries"
1,Worst customer service rude behaviour first of all they don't answer call after so many times thought to call last time they answer they speak rudely hang up on my face bad behaviour did not even ask if I want to order something
1,"I'm at sharp 9'00 at the mubai central brach of Monginis very bad experience, not satisfied with the store. the store person was very arrogant and doesn't given the on going offers of 31st October as he told that the scheme is over so why the company gives the scheme."
4,They do have a lot of varieties of cakes and pastries that too in different different designs. The shop is easily visible from the traffic as it is situated to the road side. I bought a chocolate cake of 350g @ ‚Çπ380. Price varies from cake to cake and flavor to flavor. They accept both cash as well as card also.
1,"Be prepared to clean their floor with your hands! I wish I could give zero or negative stars solely because the people there are insulting their customers by telling them to literally get out of the shop and not to keep cakes on counters. And you will get wooden ice cream spoons to eat the cake and if any tiny piece falls down, even accidentally you will be given a tissue and asked to clean the floor with your hands. They expect you to stop eating and the clean it. According to them you are not supposed to eat there. They need a lesson or two in etiquette and customer service."
5,Staff is good and supportive. Unlimited snacks with drinks. Washrooms are clean. There r section of AC and non AC.
5,Great bar with lovely interior and proper music live singer!
2,"Basically it was a dance bar ,now it's a beer bar."
4,Dance bar entry restricted
4,Nice bar
4,"A cozy and amazing place near Kemp's corner on a slope. The staff is nice and friendly. I visited on a Saturday evening, the place was less crowded. They have cute sitting arrangements and nice paintings on the wall. We sat on the upper floor. Which has larger tables. Better for groups. They have a nice range of Hummus and I like the rolls as well. They are very juicy. I enjoyed the food. Good taste of Middle Eastern cuisine."
4,"*Prices on the menu are now different from the pictures on Google!!*

Decent little restaurant, falafel and hummus were both good. Restaurant itself looks a little tired"
5,"I Don't know why there was no rush. It's worth the price, the taste and the service.

Just go for it."
5,"We heard a lot about this place Falafel's located in Mahalaxmi and that the falafels are really mouth watering here. So we ordered falafels, Shawarma's, Falafel's and Nachos.

1) Paneer Wrap - Juicy and succulent pieces of Paneer, lettuce, olives, jalapenos, topped with smoked hummus, pickled vegetables and chefs special spicy and tangy sauce. The contents were wrapped in a soft brown wrap. The flavours were amazing.

2) Falafel Shawarma - This shawarma had lots of pieces of falafel tikki's,  lettuce, tomatoes, pickled vegetables, cucumber, spicy red sauce topped with garlic mayo and hummus. This was wrapped in multi-grain khubz bread and was quite filling and yummy.

3) Grande Nachos - The Mexican corn chips were crispy as they were hand made and topped with Salsa Verde, beans, garlic mayo and chilli sauce.

We liked the packaging that was done by the staff of Falafel's and they  made sure that the bags had the corona free tag and that they had followed all the guidelines properly. The delivery was quick. Falafels and wraps from this place will remind u of Middle Eastern and Lebanese cuisines."
5,"1.  Classic Chicken Shawarma - This shawarma had lots of soft and fresh pieces of chicken , lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, pickled vegetables, spicy schug sauce topped with mint & garlic mayo and hummus. This was wrapped in multi-grain khubz bread and was quite filling.

2. Original Falafel Wrap - This wrap was made out of falafels, green and pickled vegetables, topped with hummus, mayo, cheese sauce and schug sauce. The bread used for this wrap was a brown huge roti.

3. Nachos - A big bowl of crispy Mexican Corn Chips topped with Cheddar, beans, salsa and cheese sauce. The quantity was really nice and filling.

It was very safe to eat from here and place was hygienic as well."
4,"A convenient vegetarian option for people coming outside the Royal Opera House late night. Its open till late hours and the food is prepared fresh.

I ordered the curry and butter Dosa and it was delicious. I ordered additional appam and it was good too."
4,"Nice and hygienic place. Tried their Thailaiva idli and chettinad idli. Loved both of them. Had the malabari curry with malabari parotta too and it was great.
At the end we had the kapi (coffee) ice-cream and I definitely recommend trying it out.
The service was slow and the staff was not at all attentive."
3,"Food is decent, not very good but good enough to satisfy hunger for a strict vegetarian. Hygiene of utensils and cutlery needs major overhaul. Staff is courteous and very attentive. In all a decent place to eat ."
2,"The order took quite some time to prepare. The taste was okay but didn‚Äôt meet my expectations, especially compared to other authentic South Indian restaurants I‚Äôve tried. Considering the taste and service, I felt the prices were on the higher side."
2,"The restaurant not living up to his old standards.
Now the quality of food is low. Only 2 waiters.
Long time for food to get ready. Food quantity is less but price is more. Not at all value for money.
Once upon a time it was a good south Indian restaurants serving tasty food. But no more it is living upto its reputation.  Disappointed..."
5,"I had recently ordered in some food from this place and was extremely happy that I did so. The food here is absolutely delicious and worth every penny. Super affordable and delicious food under one roof. I ordered Chicken Crispy, Bombil Fry and Kaleja Petha. Everything was fresh and delicious and came warm. I would totally recommend everyone to order from here.

Working men and women around the vicinity visit the restaurant in day time and is usually packed. The food is really good and definitely recommended."
1,It is worst for fishfood nasty unfreeshed and frideged fish smells bad and lil uncooked..
5,This is a small restaurant in Tardeo on the main road which serves absolutely delicious food. The place has good veg and non veg food which is absolutely lip smacking. Men & Women also working around visit this place visit the same for lunch and the place is really good. Do a takeaway if you don‚Äôt want to dine in because the food is absolutely delicious.
5,"One of the most affordable places to chill near Haji Ali. A must try place. Starters are good, do visit. P. S There are no Wine shops in this area."
4,Tried some stuff but the chicken sheelh kebab here is the best in the city for sure ..try a delivery if they have ..visit only if u r like normal regular but decent bars üòä
3,"Yeah food was fine. Tandoori chicken piece size was very small. Soup with momo was good. Tandoori fish, Mutton biryani is very yummy. Mutton seekh not that good. You can try once to Shalimar Kemp's corner."
5,"Some places have special place in your heart, well this place maintained their legacy since more than 50 years, serving you the taste of Rick flavours from North India.
A family fine dine restaurant located at The Shalimar Hotel, Kemps Corner. This restaurant is usually full even over the weekdays.
We visited with our family, and as always the experience was really good.
Right from service to the food, we enjoyed everything here.
The food is really delicious, they have actually managed to maintain their standards all through.

They have added some Asian dishes also in their menu which is worth a try.

Chef Ashish Das made sure that our evening was well taken care off, he personally visited every table to check on the guests and personally acknowledged our presence.

Must Try:
Paneer Chilly Samosa
Wontons

The quantity of both was really good and stuffing was also decently filled, taste was also good.

If you visit here, you have to go for their Indian menu, the Dal Makhani and Paneer Pasandar was salivating. I personally am a fan of Dal Makhani here.
The lip smacking Indian menu will give u reasons to visit this place again n again.

Well recommended for good family gathering and family dine in place."
4,Nice ambiance comfortable seating food was ok. Icecream was good.
3,I would request to please change your plates‚Ä¶they are looking to dirty and glasses must be clean..overall food has good taste but i‚Äôm not satisfied with the service and the cleanliness of plates amd glasses
5,"Good location, Good ambience, courteous staff, good food, tried the vegiterian options here seemed really great overall a very good experience with the place."
5,"Food was so good it made us laugh! We had garlic prawns in bread buns as well as butter chicken and it was just soooo delicious! The desert and whiskey sour I had was also perfect!!

My only feedback was that the manager seemed to micromanage the younger guys who served us in front of us which was less of a pleasant experience. Perhaps they were new but it‚Äôs the only thing about the experience I can fault.

I genuinely wish I have the opportunity to come here again!! A must if in Bombay ü§©"
5,"A very good food experience.

We tried 2 starters and 2 main course based on their suggestion, and the starters were absolutely amazing, out of the 2. The best was Paneer Pepperica.

The staff was also good and responsive, the manager Mr. Montu and a lady attended us.
Only a small suggestion for the restaurant that the ambiance seemed a little dark, it could be because all the lights were not on.

Overall experience was very good and I'd recommend this restaurant for their delicious food."
5,"We came from surat to try this place, the food was excellent, quantity was also good & all the staff members were very polite. Mr.Montu is a good manager & very friendly.
We had a fun lunch"
5,"Visited Golden Chimney on a weekend and loved it.
They have a variety of veg and non veg dishes to offer.
Located strategically in South Mumbai, this restaurant is a gem.
The food is delicious.
The service by staff is impeccable.
My favourite dish is the Veg platter, butter garlic prawns and the fish curry and rice.
Must visit."
5,"A best cousin restaurant in Mumbai City.
The ambience of the restaurant is very nice. The Verity of food in vegetarian and non-vegetarian. Have much veriety of drinks including mocktail. We had a delicious food here. The food taste is really good. The behaviour and service of the staff is very nice.
You can try the coconut paisam. It was really nice.
All experience made it awesome."
5,"It took me to the golden Bombay era. Especially the mouth watering taste of Chicken Changezi and Ice Cream Sode. Combination killed it. All n all if you want to feel the true taste of Bombay, do visit üëçüëå"
4,"This place is really good for a quick stop & have lemon tea. Have tried out few things here, just giving this place a 4 in Food because of its Joojeh Kebab, Rest snacks are average. Lemon tea is 5/5.
Also the best part is I even found Gaz here (Persian sweet candy), which was at a reasonable price of 500 Rs for a Box. A cute little stop by whenever you pass from Breach candy side."
1,"Honest review - TATI food & resto. All the praises regarding the resto are totally fake.
Food was the biggest let down, felt like puking. Hygiene is not very good, full dusty small place, rates are high, ambience in worst. Worst of all the owner was shouting on phone the whole time, cursing very loudly literally giving headache.

Waiter is clueless boy living in his own world, doesn't know menu, doesn't comprehend easily what someone asking. Ordered keema pav since didn't want to exp & reviews were positive. Costed 160 per plate. What came was a disappointment I won't even eat for free. Mutton keema served in the smallest & flatest plate possible in which some make serve chaptis or keep Parle G. Coming to taste, it didn't taste anything like nonveg instead it made me puke. If you know shepu bhaji, it was full of that & peas. Tasted aweful, ate half since was very hungry & left rest to avoid puking. Ordered a pattice which was somewhat better since it was from bakery.

Don't go here, instead this resto should be banned by fassai."
3,"The only parsi eatery where you can get indian, chinese, mughlai cuisine at moderate price. There are no budget friendly restaurant in such posh area, so this place is popular among office crowd and collage students. Staff and owner was polite. I tried chicken kheema paav, chicken seekh kabab along with chicken biryani. Food quality and quantity was superb but the biryani was little sweet also there was only one big piece of chicken in biryani. Not recommended for vegetarian as they don't have much options."
5,"A nice place to have dinner/lunch/breakfast in pocket-friendly rates in such a posh Bandra area. They serve everything from Irani chai, bun maska, chinese, biryani to indian curries and dal tadka along with lassi and other refreshments. The ambience is old and okayish but the taste was satisfactory if not great with a very fast service. Good option for people visiting Jaslok or nearby hospitals.

PS: Even it is cheap in rate, it is just in front of World‚Äôs costliest house- Antillia, house of Mukesh Ambani!"
4,"We ordered cheese pav bhaji. The taste was good and flavoursome.

The service was okay.

Usually busy. I guess it should be cleaner."
5,"Tried Masala Pav alongwith Khichiya Papad and Khada pav bhaji in one of the most famous restaurant in Girgaon, loved it! Well balanced and delicious. Recommend to try pav bhaji and varietiesüëå"
3,"Recently visited Manohar Pav Bhaji and really enjoyed their pav bhaji! The flavor was nicely balanced‚Äînot too heavy on garam masala like many places nowadays. Perfect for those who prefer a classic taste. The tawa pulao was decent, just does the job but nothing exceptional. Overall, a good place for a satisfying meal."
4,"Manohar Pav Bhaji is a popular pav bhaji stall located in Girgaon, Mumbai. It is known for its delicious and authentic pav bhaji, masala pav and pulao made with fresh vegetables and a flavorful masala. The hotel has been in business for over 50 years and is a favorite among locals."
4,"The taste is Normal nothing special about the places ..
It‚Äôs old vintage and Non AC ..
The price is quiet high I think Rs 180 for just Pav Bhaji ..the Quality is ok ..
One time you can have it from here ‚Ä¶
Just not that great"
3,"Bcoz its not so good in quality but the price of the items are also cheap...its good restaurant for drivers,salesman etc...but not for family...you cannot visit this restaurant with families..."
1,Is t a restaurant??? Shame on google to show such places ..üòè

4,Recently when I passed from the exit of central railway station and I saw this outlet looks nice as there are some people taking their dishes. Even at the same place you have other options which is the KFC store just next to this location. I ordered a masala dosa and the taste of sambhar and coconut chutney is average but the potato stuffing is nice. They also have many options such as coffee and many more.
1,Food quality are not good. I have took Idli Sambhar but Sambhar teste was not good and they are also not serve food in hot.
1,"I have ordered veg biryani see who is tasting my food cockroach ü™≥ running on briyani
Very unhygienic restaurant FDA should take action on this restaurant"
2,"Nice food stall at Mumbai central railway stations.
Costly in regard to  the taste and services. Air-conditioning not working (as good as not working)..
Congested. 2-3 times costly than a usual place. Ordinary plate of food costs ‚Çπ 200/- . Which is worthy of not more than ‚Çπ80/-. A machine coffee which costs usually ‚Çπ10-20 is sold for ‚Çπ50/- here..
Overall l would say that taste, cost and service don't satisfy mutually.

Average cleanliness observed..."
4,"The main advantage of this food junction is that, this is approved by IRCTC and open for 24 hrs. The food was good and tasty, we were very hungry and we got this amazing food shop where you can get all type of main course and combo offers. Yes, it is costly but quality is supper. And the dessert is also too good. Here we have to do self service and water is also good. We enjoyed the food and fill our stomach with full satisfaction. the seating arrangement and interior is very organized and we'll maintained. Thank you IRCTC to make this happen in Mumbai central railways station.
4 star because of its rates it little expensive for common people."
5,Delicious ... Safely packaged food..
4,I tried idli sambar which was very good tasty sambar n idli was very good not the ones you eat which has a lot of soda i visited on sunday morning i got complementary Pineapple Sheera aswell upma also to try i guess they were also tasting good
3,"quite honestly I didn't find the restaurant's food to be anything special, my Dosa wasn't lacking in flavor, like the rest of the food.  the positive points go to the efficient and friendly team, and the well-made and beautiful decor."
1,"Shagun Hotel has the worst food I‚Äôve ever had. The dishes are bland, greasy, and downright horrible. The dishes tasted old, and the vegetables are mushy. Nothing is fresh, and the food looks gross. The whole place feels unhygienic, and the flavors are awful. It‚Äôs a complete waste of money, and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone. Stay far away!"
4,Had superb dlx Punjabi thali at Shagun. Limited thali but was worth every rupee.
4,"We were blown away by the taste and quality of the food. We ordered the paneer tikka masala and a vegetable biryani, and both dishes were absolutely delicious. The flavors were rich and authentic, and the portions were generous."
4,Good place. Quite busy during the summer days. Most flavors were out of stock unfortunately. Sitting space is inadequate. 8-10 mins walk from Mumbai Central Station
5,"I recently had the pleasure of trying the Sitafal ice cream at Naturals, and I must say it was an absolutely delightful experience!

The texture of the ice cream was perfectly creamy, and the flavor of Sitafal was rich and authentic. It had a wonderful balance of sweetness and a hint of tropical goodness that transported my taste buds to a paradise of flavors.

The ambiance of the ice cream shop added to the overall experience. It was clean, well-maintained, and had a welcoming atmosphere that made enjoying my ice cream even more enjoyable."
5,"Overall experience  is good.
Staff behavior  is excellent.
Store is maintained  standard  higine."
5,"This branch was opened till late night due to Ramadan and the staff was extremly helpful especially Manish, who helped me and offered an example of great customer service. Do try their Mango Sundae if you plan to visit this place"
4,My favourite go to place. I tried lot of ice creams but natural has my heart love the natural taste and my favourite flavour is tender coconut !!üòç this place is always crowded whether its weekend or weekday.
1,"The experience is worst, Its too noisy, Staff is too noisy, the AC is Too Noisy, not maintaining cleanliness and Hygiene, using Foul Languages, tables were not cleaned, wash Rooms were used by the beggers ewww, worst than Hell"
1,There is no system of rating zero or else they deserve no stars. Worst ever hygiene and service. Rude staff.
1,"Of all the Dominos outlet I have visited this has to be the worst one. Dominos team should take public reviews seriously and get a reality check.
The staff is disinterested in taking order, the table is always messed up .. no one is bothered to clean.
Food quality is also not upto Dominos level mark.
Even if you sit here for hours and do not place still order, still the staff won't be interested in asking you."
3,"Pizza is really tasty but we have to order online.
The staff is good but there is no washroom it's very bad .
In case of emergency we have to go to the public toilet after we order here"
1,"Worst experience ever, There was no staff available to tak.tue fine in orders, neither the other staff were kind to call the manager when asked for.
The manager's attitude is next level even after calling out upon him.

Please visit this store at your own service expectations."
5,Loved their special green chutney with sandwiches. Highly recommended
5,Sundar and Rajesh sell only Sada Sandwich and it's the best you can have. Pit them against any Sada sandwich you have had till date and this stall shall beat them hands down.. Not be missed
5,Awesome sandwich. His chutney is being exported every month . Very famous street side stall in the area
5,Their green chutney is a MUST! Get extra üòãüòç
5,One of the best sandwiches in town
3,"Calcutta Chicken Biryani was a regular Biryani... The Matal Chingri was very Good.... The Tangra Chilli Chicken was also Good, Tasty... However I didn't Like the Kancha Lonka Chicken, it was like Palak Bhaji. In Desserts We had Mishti Doi.... Everybody Liked it."
2,"Unchi Dukan Feeki Pakwan.

You must have heard of this proverb.

We experienced it at Oh! Calcutta. We ordered Pressure Cooker Mutton, chicken biryani and Luchi and two mocktails, Watermelon+Basil and Aam Pora Shorbat.

In total we paid +2700‚Çπ.

Overall the taste of the food was good, but quality and quantity must have been better.

We have eaten at Leopold cafe, Mirchi and Mime, Ranjit da Dhaba and so on. Mentioning this so that you know we have already considered the level of the restaurant and speaking only after analysing that.

So here is my story. After finishing our meal, we were given a feedback form in which I gave mixed reviews according to the food and services provided.

In specific, I mentioned that the quantity of the food should be increased according to the price.
But this was never a problem untill the manager came to us cross questioning why we gave an average feedback. And on top of that he started to argue and tried to make us seem small that we only ordered items for ‚Çπ2700+ (Seems as if he was not ready for any suggestions at all and wanted us to order food for ‚Çπ5000 or more).

When we gave this feedback, he said that this is normal.

I don't have a problem whether this is normal or not or whether you choose to give that much quantity in this price.

But the main problem was they are just arrogant and ignorant to guests satisfaction. They think that they deserve 5star irrespective of their service or food and only a fool would give them a lower rating.

Lastly they took additional Service Charge which is not legal to take on the bill and is completely optional however they are taking it from everyone. Bill is attached for the reference.

So, for us, it was the first and last time there. Wish you all a better experience than mine."
5,"Mutton biriyani with chicken chaap was awesome. Kalbaishaki along with aam pora sarbat was cherry on top.
Must try, highly recommend..
Mutton was tenderly cooked,  biriyani had perfect mild flavour. In geneal other restaurants makes mistake with morderate or strong flavour,  but in oh Calcutta it was perfect üëå"
5,"Visited this restaurant in a weekday. There were few people. We tried the Mochar Chop (Rs. 375) which was soft and crispy, Rajbarir Channa Kofta Curry (Rs. 445) which was sweet and delicious, Hing Aloor Dum (Rs. 445) , Cholar dal (Rs. 225) that tasted well with Luchi 4 pieces (Rs. 135) and Gobindobhoger bhaat (Rs. 225). The baked rasgulla was heavenly. The prices are on the higher side, overall taste and quantity was good."
4,"Great little spot for enjoying the delicious Bengali Cuisine. It's heaven if you're non vegetarians. Limited vegetarian options, but the sweets are to die for. Calm and composed atmosphere... Just like how a Bengali restaurant should be. The Koraishutir Chop is a must try while the Baked Rosogolla is the best dessert I've had till date. Good discount options available on zomato gold too!"
2,"Poor service,poor quality food, space to sit is not even average,so much congested,humid,even water was not cold."
5,"Good care taken while placing seat arrangements Good staff good quality of food
Efficient service clean rooms excellent location and super restaurant
People generally have a meal here they come in this area for wholesale shopping
Its a vegetarian hotel. But its better to have food according to locality there outside. But yeah food has lots of varieties also at reasonable price according to hotel"
4,"Amazing food. Prices are very reasonable anybody any middle class person can easily fulfill his stomach by having a good quality of food and a good hygiene with good ambience and the prices are very cheap literally 70-100 rupees for a good thali which contains sufficient amount of food.
Thumbs up pal, you are doing a great job üëç"
1,"Worst sandwich I ever had, grilled sandwich was all soggy, also tried rabdi falooda which is supposed to be made with chilled milk and rabdi, however to my shock it was warm milk. Worst experience ever and total loss of money. Don't visit this restaurant, better to eat at the stalls in Kalbadevi."
3,"Well, in google Maps it is shown as veg restaurant
Please don't get disappointed after visiting coz they've got the place renovated and it is a non veg restaurant now.
Tbh not bad place in terms of the quantity and the taste if food but in terms of hygiene this is not the right place!
Just a honest review...."
4,"Hearing this awakens ones soul as the very 2 warm yoga instructors turned wellness experts promote their slice of life to create awareness about vegan food but also which is raw , no refined and extra processed ingredients used, low oil usage that too of cold pressed coconut oil.

They work on a Pre order basis with deliveries done via Swiggy and scootsy this one can try not only their mains but also bakery stuff, crackers and desserts that don‚Äôt get you down a guilt trip.

A neat small kitchen with a seating outside surrounded with plants we were welcomed at The Prana kitchen with some healthy good for you food with their own spins to the techniques used in cooking.

We were served an array of dishes in an eco friendly thali which comprised of watermelon feta salad (almonds were used to make their feta version), nachos on home baked multigrain chips with cashew cheese, beetroot patties with a tangy sweet chutney and paired with a refreshing ice tea.

Out of these my favourite was the nachos whose cheese sauce one would not believe of it being made with cashews and it beat the dairy ones, the salad was just soo good and perfect summer replenish. The tikkis had a very nice flavour with a kick of garlic.

Next we were served some herbed hummus with their dehydrated flax seed crackers which were soo delicate and yummy. My favourite dish turned out to be the pesto zoodles with the pesto being super creamy made with cashews again and didn't make me feel like I was have ing veggies instead of staple pasta.

What‚Äôs a meal without dessert. The raw cacao smoothie bowl was good but could have been better if there was some granola on it and fresh fruits would have made it a 5/5.

Summers are not summers without popsicles and we had strawberry almond milk popsicles which had raw cane sugar this again healthy and soo good with real berries.

All in all for all my vegan friends who want to go a mile extra to have stuff which is preservative free, raw and vegan with homegrown and quality ingredients with love and so much thought put into it,¬† prana is your place.

Food-4/5
Service-3.5/5
Vfm-3.5/4
Ambiance-3.5/5"
5,"First place where I stepped into for knowing and understanding Yoga in the year 2016 with an unforgetable experience of peace and serenity in a room filled with silence. The atmosphere of experiencing birds chirping and greens in all corners of the place made an absolute connect of an home-bound environment. And lastly, the addition of some wonderful heart-warming people that make the place bright and happy."
1,"Very Pathetic experience!!

I do not wish to give a one star also but then unable to write a review.

To remove emotional baggage,  needed help so came across them. But below is the experience.

Sorry to take the name but important so that others are directed to someone else.

Had a experience with Ms. Shradhha Vora.

Feedback as below, during the session,

1. Continuously Clipping & unclipping hair & playing, was very distracting during the entire session.

2. Sorry but each time cleaning running nose was little untidy. Not even mentioning to be excused for it. Either it was her hair or nose. Sorry to mention.

3. I was waiting to write back, as I wanted to see the follow up after completing two sessions, unfortunately follow up was once & that too I had a query which went unresolved.

4. When I mentioned I had multiple thoughts how to tackle, there wasn't any appropriate solution.

5. I never felt that they are there for client.

6. When asked for details before joining in- how it works/what are you going to do & how like the doctor suggest the line of treatment. But you always insisted to take experience & you yourself were not able to explain.

7. Also when checked for testimonials on net but there are none. On asking her, she  mentioned it's confidential.

Friends please go ahead only if they are good reviews otherwise don't trust them.

There is no proper follow up or solution to any questions.

8. After first talk, as Sharddha mentioned it to be the session.Thereafter, once I had called her  & explained one of the scenario but she didn't even guided me what to do & only insisted to take up the next session. Though I had paid for the first talk/session. So solution seems to be only taking up in sessions & not otherwise/ in between-how a client feels, they don't care.

All in one, it seems as if you are only taking up the session, we pay but follow up & solution is zero, unfortunate.

9. Also I checked on range of payments it's approx 1500 but when you asked for Rs 2000, we never bargain, as process was important. But now experience says there is no value for money!!!!!

10. One more thing, each time during the session, there was no preparation,two min before the session time, Shraddha use to message whether the person is ready. The confirmation/readiness of client to be checked, should have come from them, atleast half an hour before. Your form clearly mentions cancellation will be charged. Isn't it your responsibility also to check with client half an hour before if all in place or not or was it pinging just two minutes before & if client cancels/forgets/or is stuck- u might have charged also- one never knows.

Request you to take this feedback & guide clients accordingly.

Thanking you."
5,Scrumptious food.. was super surprised and delighted to find this little vegan gem in Mumbai.
5,I am experience was very good.  And i am looking forward for more courses.  The staff is very helpfull.  ‚ù§
5,"It had been a long time haven't tried the Japanese cuisine and was eager to have some.Was scrolling around Zomato and found out this lovely place.

The place is located near Imperial height,tulsiwadi Tardeo.They serve Japanese and sushi and are famous for their cuisines.Going to the menu i found that the prices are also worth it.

I had Non-Veg Sushi Platter which had an amazing taste.The sushi was perfect cooked.Then we had Chicken stir fry buckwheat noodles and Chicken stir fry udon noodles they were also authentic like tried for the first time,and was good.

Then we also had Chicken yakitori which had small Chicken boneless pieces marinated with different sauce.The overall food was good liked it.The delivery was also on time."
5,"Tokyo is all about bowls and bowls of ramen and thats precisely what they serve the best. It's a small dine in place, where in it can accommodate 7-10 customers. We opted for home delivery - the service is prompt. The food was delivered on time and their packaging impressed us.

Honestly, everything that we ordered was extremely delicious and made us crave for more.

We loved üëá

‚Ä¢ Non-veg Sushi platter - We tried two varieties of sushis from their best seller: Fresh salmon and Chicken teriyaki. Both having such distinct flavors&taste and perfectly rolled. I personally have never enjoyed chicken sushis as much I did of theirs.
I would highly recommend you to try the fresh salmon sushi and chicken teriyaki sushi.

‚Ä¢ Chicken Yakitori - A must have. A very common Japanese dish - grilled chicken served in savory sweet sauce. It tasted well.

‚Ä¢ Chicken Stir Fried Buckwheat Noodles - Buckwheat Noodles are my personal favorite in comparison to udon noodles. This was loaded with veggies and chicken, having a creamy texture. We enjoyed it.

‚Ä¢ Chicken Miso Mazeman Ramen - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Mazeman is traditionally a broth-less ramen whereas miso is soyabean based ramen. This bowl consists of noodles, fried chicken, boiled eggs, vegetables and a little broth. This bowl is a complete healthy meal in itself.

Verdict - The food is drooling delicious and does complete justice to it's name and the cuisine. If you are craving for Japanese food then this is the place for you. You have to try their bowls as they are one of a kind and will satisfy all your cravings.
The quantity of the food is worth the money especially when the food is of high quality and incredibly tasty."
4,"When it‚Äôs a weekend and you plan to have a chill weekend !
Well same happened with me today so let me take you to this amazing place who can deliver at your door stop.
So all the love for sushi is here :D

I honestly not being a fan of Sushi but heard a lot about this place from my friends and they appreacited so much that I actually ended up ordering from here and trust me I loved it so much.
My family also enjoyed their meal wth this menu.

I
Order:
1)sweet corn tempura :- This was just amazing. Must order one
2)asparagus tempura roll:- if you really wanna fall in love with sushi do try this one.
3)veg stir fried buckwheat noodles
4)yasai itame with steam rice :- This was with veggies and was really good.

PS:- They actually made jain for me as I recommended them.
They have some good options in Veg & Non Veg too.

I am certainly ordering again from here."
5,"we ordered sushi.. so really the place packs the sushi very well .. and it clean packing ..
The soya is very salty but can manage it with the ginger and wasabi ..
We ordered: veg California roll: was really good .. enjoyed every bite ..
Asparagus tempura roll : the asparagus was really fried ... how I wished it would be a little less oily and would love every bit of it..
Shitake teriyaki roll was good ..
Baby corn tempura roll again the deep fried was too much could just cut down a little on the frying otherwise the sushi was perfect..
Value for money .."

*REVIEW IS BASED ON PERSONAL EXPERIENCE!"
5,"It was a Friday night and we really wanted to start our weekend with something interesting and happening. We came across this recently opened place called Baroke at Grant Road.

Location is bit confusing with maps, however the manager helped us in finding it very quickly. Place is situated on the first floor of Krishna palace Hotel.

Ambience and decor actually cheered up our mood. It is a perfect party and chill out place for you and your gang. Place is spacious with limited yet comfortable sitting area with a dance floor.

Coming to the food, food menu is not so lengthy with some veg and non veg quick bite items. We loved all the dishes that we tried. The Bar menu offers some really good options in cocktails.

We totally loved phuljhadi chicken tikka, fish tikka and baby corn tempura. Also the white sauce pasta for main course was creamy and delicious.

From Bar menu we tried Cucumber rosemary gin tonic, Gauva Daiquiri and Coffee caipirinha. We totally enjoyed our drinks. All of them were refreshing.

Baroke sets up a perfect weekend mood with good food, great music and classy ambience.

Totally recommended.

Happy eating.üòä."
5,"Baroke was something where I didn‚Äôt go with great hopes but trust me visiting here changed my outlook for a good reason. Lot of pubs have come up these days in Mumbai but this place reminded me only 90s where the interior is rustic and gives a classic look. The music was dapper and the crowd is happening.

The manager was very much helpful is suggesting us the best food as per our liking. The food was impeccable. I am sharing few recommendations and I bet you will go there again to have them - chilli cheese toast, chicken tikka pizza, stuffed masaledar Kulcha served with Dal makhani. Although the menu is not that extensive but it does fulfil the need.

Highly recommended place for great taste of music and yummy food."
4,"If you're looking for a place to party in SoBo, Baroke is the place to go. Quite close to the Grant Road station, this place has a dance floor with good music and lights.
We tried quite a few dishes and mocktails. In starters, we loved corn fritters and cheese chilli toast. Bruschetta was decent too. Chicken tikka was a showstealer. Really tender and juicy chicken cooked well.
We had mint melon cooler and coffee chocolate martini to wash down the food with. Loved the drinks and their presentation.
In mains, we loved the stuffed kulcha with dal makhni. Also had noodles with green chicken. Didn't quite like this one. The green gravy wasn't working with the noodles.

Overall, it was a nice experience and a good place to party."
2,"I ordered khepsa mutton biryani. Mutton was not cooked properly. Biryani was too oily. We just ate the rice and left the mutton.
Service was good otherwise."
5,Very nice place for family and friends tast was also Excellent try there special khepsa and chicken Lucknowi gravy was best in taste overall great experience
5,"We felt very welcomed at the restaurant.
A waiter came over straight away with water and took our order. We had veg noodles and veg fried rice - both were absolutely delicious! With just the right amount of spice (as we‚Äôd been asked how much we‚Äôd like) will definitely be returning. Thank you for a pleasant experience üòä"

The service is prompt and the staff is courteous, making the dining experience comfortable and enjoyable. The ambiance is cozy and welcoming, perfect for both families and groups of friends. Their Chicken Barra is one of the highlights ‚Äî tender, juicy, and perfectly marinated. The prawns are fresh, well-cooked, and seasoned just right, offering a burst of flavor in every bite.

5,"This is one of the best restaurnt at grant road , we ordered manchow soup which was amazing ,then quarter tandoori with cheese , the taste was good but I will tell u to avoid coz it was basic tandoori with grated cheese instead order something different n pieces where also tiny so not satisfied with my choice of order though, the we order mutton biryani n honestly it is a must try ...n lastly we ended up with fruit salad with ice cream ... It was fruit custard which we make at home n topped with vanilla ice cream n drizzled with red syrup it was nice   but  not chilled enough as it should be  so instead I could had ordered brownie sizzlers. The ambience was soooo good service is excellent food ofcourse was very tasty , n staff was also nice"

4,"Look out for their portion sizes, we ordered Mandi with Chicken Kadai for two guys and they gave ginormous sized portions for two which is no way normal humans can finish. Mandi was tastefully prepared - rice was fragrant and the meat was succulent though I must point out that a batch of rice on the bottom was a bit dry.
Chicken Kadai was good as well but it felt like they added a bit of red food coloring - had to wash hands twice to remove it."
1,"Curry was very oily and extremely salty, Kepsa rice had excessive oil and chicken bone was bleeding, service was pathetic, even their water tap was broken and when i visited again after some months that was still broken, prices are low but still not worth it, we doesn't even finish our food coz of the pathetic quality.
Not recommended at all."

Being regular here the staff is friendly and service is super quick for me.

The ambience is nice. The place is clean and hygenic.

4,"I recently visited Shiv Sagar near Mumbai Central Station, and it was a great experience for anyone looking for flavorful vegetarian food. This place is a well-known spot for North and South Indian cuisine, serving quality food with a quick service time.

We ordered Veg Kolhapuri, Roti, and Jeera Rice. The Veg Kolhapuri was perfectly spiced, with a rich, thick gravy loaded with fresh vegetables. The spice level was just right‚Äînot too mild, not overly spicy‚Äîgiving it an authentic Kolhapuri taste. The rotis were soft, freshly made, and paired well with the curry. The Jeera Rice was well-cooked, aromatic, and light, making for a great combination with the sabzi.

The restaurant was clean and well-maintained, with a simple but comfortable dining setup. Since it‚Äôs near Mumbai Central, it gets quite busy, but the service was decent quick and efficient. The staff were polite and ensured we had a smooth dining experience.

The pricing is quite high, and the portion sizes are satisfying. Whether you‚Äôre travelling through Mumbai Central or looking for a good vegetarian meal in the area, Shiv Sagar is definitely worth a visit.

P.S. I HAVE ATTACHED PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE VEG KOLHAPURI."
4,"Good place for all types of Veg foods and juice, quality and quantity both are very good, manage very well in small place and best location in Kamp's Corner."
5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Shiv Sagar Restauran and I must say, it was an exceptional experience! This iconic restaurant has been a Mumbai staple for decades, and it's easy to see why.

*Ambience:* 4/5

The moment I stepped into Shiv Sagar, I was struck by its retro charm. The decor is simple yet elegant, with comfortable seating and ample natural light. While it may not be the fanciest restaurant in town, the warm and inviting atmosphere makes up for it.

*Food:* 5/5

Now, onto the main event ‚Äì the food! Shiv Sagar is renowned for its South Indian cuisine, and boy, did they deliver! I ordered the Masala Dosa, which was cooked to perfection. The dosa was crispy, the filling was flavorful, and the sambar was rich and tangy. I also tried the Idli, which was soft and fluffy, and the Vada, which was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.

*Service:* 4.5/5

The service at Shiv Sagar was top-notch. The staff were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. They were happy to make recommendations and ensured that our glasses were always full.

*Value:* 4.5/5

Shiv Sagar offers excellent value for money. The prices are reasonable, and the portion sizes are generous. You can enjoy a delicious meal without breaking the bank.

*Overall:* 4.5/5

Shiv Sagar Restaurant is a must-visit for anyone who loves South Indian cuisine. With its warm atmosphere, delicious food, and excellent service, it's a gem in the heart of Mumbai. Don't miss out on this iconic dining experience!

*Recommended For:* South Indian food lovers, families, and anyone looking for a casual yet satisfying dining experience.

*Will I Return?:* Absolutely! I'm already planning my next visit to try more of their delicious dishes."
4,"Loved the Masala Dosa from here, always the place to visit for some comfort food. Overall Great vibes."
4,A good joint for great food. Must have Masala pav and watermelon juice.  Reasonably priced. Quick service. Tasty food.
2,"Quality of so called ""fresh chicken"" has deteriorated; very disappointed  with the quality I have been getting recently. Complained but I don't think they care!"
2,"Initially the broiler chicken was cut as per your size and requirements. Now they cut it very big and also the liver and kidneys are not provided to the customers.
Very unhappy about this. The Shivaji park does provide all the pieces and that's how it should be. A whole chicken is a full chicken and the entire chicken should be given without removing any pieces."
5,Highly recommended for all type of Non Veg frozen foods. If you don't get it here you will probably not get it any where.Prabhat farm fresh is known for its Quality and fresh chicken.(chicken from their Alibaug farms).
5,Owner belongs to Somvanshiya Kshatriya Pathare community. Original inhabitants of Mumbai.Peaceful Maharashtrian community with best ethics in Non veg food. Especially Chicken comes from another SomvanshiyaKshatriyaPathare community Mohini Mhatre polutary farms in Alibaug.
5,"Best quality chicken (fresh/frozen), ready to eat sausages, Salamis, etc. Worth going there deeply in the gulli."
5,"If you love chicken or shawarma or both then you definitely can't miss this place. Junction of perfect taste, great quality and quantity. Only one thing they can't offer you everytime is a place to sitüòÖ because it is always full with customers. But Friendly and quick staff won't make you wait. Extra chicken shawarma is their most popular dish."
2,"Just an average shawarma nothing special at all
Not at all juicy‚Ä¶just like dry chicken

If you‚Äôre really shawarma eater then I suggest Mumbra koyla Shawarma
Best ever

But this is really disappointing"
5,"Taste üòã was just outstanding, Fantastic, service was better than many eateries in th area around. Atmosphere in that part of the world is always electrifying almost whole year. It is worth every penny. Must try atleast once in a lifetime.üëÜüëåüëç"
5,"Kings shawarma
It is place which is located at famous mohd. Ali road. This place is very famous for their shawarma.
When I recently visited this place I chose to order-
Chicken shawarma- was very good in taste. Better than any other places for sure.
Chicken shawarma with cheese & olive- it was very cheesy and too delicious loved it.
Chicken shawarma open- open was perfectly cooked. And it was juicy.

All of the shawarmas were very fabulous in taste. I loved all of them they were delicious and finger licking.
Worth visiting.
Service was fast. They served us each dish very fast in just a minute.
Staff was polite and friendly."
3,Very affordable Shawarma with quite a variety to offer. The place is a bit congested and you can feel the heat of the burner very well. During it's rush hours the service is a bit inconsistent. Still a good place to have shawarma if you are around.
4,"For our Valentine‚Äôs Day dinner, we visited this charming Italian restaurant, and it turned out to be an unforgettable experience. Given the occasion, reservations were essential, and we were lucky to secure a table.

The ambiance was warm and cozy, with soft lighting and elegant d√©cor that set the perfect romantic mood. The staff was incredibly attentive, ensuring we were comfortable throughout the evening. Their service was prompt, friendly, and efficient, adding to the overall delightful experience.

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the food‚Äîundoubtedly one of the best Italian restaurants in Mumbai! We began with some cocktails, which were decent, though not extraordinary. Moving on to the appetizers, we opted for the mushroom ravioli, and it was simply divine. The rich and creamy mushroom sauce paired perfectly with the stuffed chicken ravioli, creating a dish that literally melted in the mouth.

For the main course, we tried the Pollo Picante pizza. It had a bold, spicy kick that added a unique twist to the classic flavors. While it wasn‚Äôt the best pizza we‚Äôve ever had, it was still delicious, with a perfectly crispy crust and generous toppings.

The real showstoppers of the evening were the desserts. The Tiramisu was, without a doubt, the best I‚Äôve ever had‚Äîlight, creamy, and full of rich coffee flavors. The chocolate goey cake was equally indulgent, with a soft center that was pure perfection.

Yes, the restaurant is on the pricier side, but for an evening of exceptional food, top-notch service, and an intimate atmosphere, it‚Äôs absolutely worth it."
5,"Tried the pizza and arrabbiata pasta at Gustoso, and both were absolutely amazing! The pizza had the perfect crust, great balance of toppings, and a deliciously authentic flavor. The arrabbiata pasta was just the right mix of spice and richness‚Äîexactly what I was craving. Great food, good ambiance, and totally worth it!"
4,"We had two Margherita pizzas, 1 thin crust and one thick crust, loved them bothüíØüíØ
ALSO, we had 1 serving of Penne pasta in Red sauce, which was quite good tooüçΩÔ∏èüçΩÔ∏è
I liked the thick crust Margherita more than the thin crust, I had asked them to give me some chilli sauce and also some parmesan cheese (both free of cost).
Had beverages (yes they are quite expensive but quite delicious tooüëåüèªüëåüèª
Ambience was good, valet parking is available too. We went at dinner hours so rush was quite expected, BUT, the service was still amazing üôèüèª"
3,"Overall, I believe the taste of food and quality of cheeses used can improve at Gustoso. Here's my review of the 3 dishes I ordered.

1. The Veggie Pizza: Crust was excellent and authentic. However, the taste of the cheese was missing. Also, the base was moist. I'd want to try more pizzas here, though. Upon request, they give chili oil and parmesan as well.

2. Mushroom Risotto: This was the biggest disappointment. The consistency and texture of the sauce of the risotto was missing, and it overall lacked seasoning and flavor. It was just doused in oil, which didn't help much.

3. Tiramisu (had on a prior visit): This was  good, and I will order again.

Service: This needs improvement. They only refilled my glass with water when asked. They need to be more proactive in filling glasses with water. Also no one came to ask on my experience with the food. Staff is polite though.

Ambience: Dimly lit. The bathroom door needs better signage.

I may skip this place in the future as it's not value for money. 2k for just pizza and risotto that were not up to the mark."
1,"I visited Gustoso with my friends this weekend, expecting a great dining experience, but unfortunately, it turned out to be quite the opposite. We ordered a mushroom pizza, only to find a living worm üêõ in it. This was absolutely unacceptable and completely ruined our evening.
The restaurant did offer complimentary desserts as compensation, but we declined because the incident had already put us off. Hygiene and food safety should be a top priority for any restaurant, and this experience left us deeply disappointed. Definitely not what we expected from a place like this. Would not recommend."
4,"Tha dal baati thali is superb and must try. The thali is not very heavy as it looks. Dal is very tasty. The red garlic chutney served is also good.
The special thali has 2 subzis, we had paneer and chole served. Gulabjamun is served in sweet. Chaas is also given in the thali. You can order extra chapatis and rice as required since the thali is limited. Dal tadka in the thali is also good.
The sadi thali is ok. It does not have sweet and there is no paneer. Also the dal served is normal dal fry.
Sweet lime soda was also nice.
Serving time after placing an order is 15-20 minutes.
There are washrooms available. Parking is on the road side."
5,"R Bhagat Tarachand in Vashi is an excellent spot for delicious and hygienic food. The menu offers a wide variety of tasty dishes, catering to diverse preferences. The ambiance is pleasant, making it a great place to dine with family or friends.

However, parking can be a hassle and needs better management, especially during peak hours. Overall, it's a wonderful dining experience with minor improvements needed in parking facilities."
5,"Here's a sample of a fantastic review on delicious food:

Absolutely Delicious Experience!

I had the pleasure of dining at this Restaurant and it was truly a feast for the senses. From the very first bite, every dish burst with flavor, freshness, and authenticity.  The textures were spot-on: , crisp vegetables, and rich, balanced sauces that tied everything together.Without a doubt, this was one of the best meals I‚Äôve had in a long time. Highly recommended‚Äî5/5 stars"
4,"Good Food, but quantity was less so order accordingly. Tandoori Roti is not at all good, prefer ghee chapati (you will love it)
Masal Papad: 4/5"
2,"We had ordered tawa veg for take out. Taste was fine but after eating our stomach felt as it‚Äôs burning. Seems low widely spices are used in food prep. Not a good experience.

They have good seating space available.

Service is fine.

Overall an okay option."
4,Had very good experience here amazing food and service staff. Very good place to visit with friends and family. Should try their kabab platter it's very delicious üòã and Shanghai paneer is also very good. Worth a try with your loved ones
3,"Good food and fast service, we tried mushroom drums, chicken crispy with spinach and chicken cheese kebab. All were good but lacked a little seasoning.

Few girls are very good dancers.
Steep booze prices"
5,Very nice
1,Worst place   total fraud happens here  no bill is given charges extra over all its a  zero rated bar
4,"Authentic Kerala food, served in banana leaves. Food prices are reasonable though non veg price you may find a bit expensive. Open only for lunch, you need to collect token from the reception and wait for your turn. Air conditioned restaurant and waiting room. It gets busy with time so if you don‚Äôt want to wait you should arrive at around 12:00 PM. The place is at a walkable distance from vashi railway station."
4,"The food is authentic and simple, and the ambiance and service are good. The only disappointing aspect is that nothing in the dish was served hot. At the very least, the rice and curry should be served warm. However, overall, it was a good experience. Hope they improve on this point."
4,"Unlimited authentic food at 200/- only. However, will suggest to opt for veg option only as cost of non veg is pretty high. For one single piece of fish fry I had to shell out Rs 400/-. I.e. Cost of two thalis üòÄ

Service is superb. Prefer going on weekdays."
5,"Food is really yummy.. And service is superb... Rs 200/- for unlimited veg food.. Nonveg is additional..

Even the veg food was so delicious that I actually forgot i taken fish fry üòú

To add when we entered we saw huge waiting but got our seat in hardly 10 mins... Superquick

Must try."
5,"Kerala House offers a delightful taste of authentic Kerala cuisine. The flavors are rich and well-balanced, with standout dishes like appam and stew. Cozy ambiance and friendly service make it a great spot good fish fry with unlimited food great place to enjoy"
4,Nice place and food is worth of money they care about safety as they have maintain social distancing in seats must visit
4,Best In vicinity for people in Vashi. Rhis place has his seperate fan gang. A nice and silent place where u can just drink eat and enjoy. Not a noisy maniacs place but for a get together with booze. Nice food preparations

This restaurant charges a bottle of water of Rs.19 illegally at Rs. 35"
1,"I had been to this place with my partner on 20 April 25 for dinner, we had ordered Chicken tandoori and 1 plate mutton briyani.
Mutton briyani was worst..no proper taste, and we could feel the masala was not fully cooked..
And after having this , I had food poisoning and whole Sunday night I was with pain , vomiting and from Monday morning, dyeria started. I was suffering from this till Thursday. Today I m little better.
So , humble request to everyone who is visiting this place , to kindly prefer simple food."
4,"One of nice restaurant & bar in vashi, ambience is too good & plesent. Food quality & quantity is also good, we order chicken lollypop, chiken pahadi kabab & mandeli fry is very testy we like it, service is also good"
5,Great service. Went during new year's eve. They don't serve regular munching during the new year. Recommending to try fish and prawns chicken dishes are also great. As this is near palm Beach Road parking may be an issue so park at your own risk. There are some designated parking spots. Ambience is good and ac section is recommended there is a family area as well if you want to take your family.
5,"Back to my favourite childhood restaurant, greeted by Naveen and got seated in a cosy corner. Ordered salad, chicken manchow soup,  dal khichdi and chicken triple rice. Our waiter was Suraj Karki, service was fast and prompt.

Food is excellent and you can customise the order as per your taste preferences.
Will be visiting again."
5,"This place used to be a to go place for almost every weekend with my boys gang, post work. The good is good, the ambiance is amazingly done recently, it's no more a shady bar üòÖ it's wide and huge and weekends are usually full. But, a good place to be at during a sports event or something. Good service, open till late(1am) not very pocket friendly though."
4,"Chinese Food & Starters are good. Stands out as a Lunch home for its good food, affordable price, decent enough service.

I have been a customer for almost over a decade, at first they were a small lunch home with poor interiors recently they have redesigned the interiors and also have extended to a AC Fine dining just beside original store.

Food wise I won't recommend any of the main course dishes, from the name, vibe & feel it feels like a seafood speciality Maharashtrian lunch home but they serve Punjabi gravies which is disappointing. Since I expect a non sweet & overly textured gravy from this outlet but even their thalis have a Punjabi gravy & seafood thali has a generic tangy gravy which is no good. So avoid gravies if you aren't looking for sweet gravy.

Chinese is good, especially their fried rice is close to authentic ones not the street style, starters like crispy, lollipop, chilli, Manchurian are good even tandoori Starters like pahadi kebab, tikkas are really nice expect tandoori. I recommend to try bombil fry which is deep fried and is very crispy. I like the rates at which they serve which makes the food worth it like a quick affordable lunch place.

But don't expect Maharastrian or south Indian type food, all their gravy, Biryani are not good and full of garam masala."
4,"One of the best seafood is served here, place is small, but the food is top notch. Must try thr fish thali, its beat"
4,"This small but bustling eatery consistently draws in a crowd for its delicious food, which is well-prepared and priced reasonably. The friendly staff provides excellent service, making it a great spot to grab a bite, whether it's lunch or dinner."
5,"If you are wandering nearby sector 9 market then must visit once Sanjay lunch home.
Non veg is my first priority but once I tried paneer crispy and after that I felt in loved with that awesome taste for each and every dish."
4,"This place truly stand out for its fish dishes be it starters like bombil rava fry or prawn tawa fry or rawas or surmai masala fry. We being sea food lover went there with family n kids following good reviews mentioned on google and youtube and must say it was really good in taste. They have two units by same name side by side. We went to the AC unit. Their kitchen is common. They served us fresh fish unlike other places where u r not sure of the freshness and quality. As my son is a mutton lover and we ordered for mutton thali, must say it was a disappointment owing to way it was served just with mutton sukha and no mutton gravy item. The gravy they gave was generic which is used both in fish n other curry item. Another disappointment was that we ordered for goan fish curry, but they served fish masala which was spicy devoid of goan curry flavor n taste. When checked with their staff, they said they dont specialize in that kind of curry n serve malvani fish masala. This was a bit disappointment . Rest the taste of their items are good and i hope their management takes note of improving few of the dishes based on our feedback here. This was reason 5 star rating has not been given. Also its a lunch home so one wont find drinking alcoholic beverages option here."
4,"Conveniently Located Eatery in Vashi
Tucked away in Sector 17, Vashi, near McDonald's, this roadside eatery offers affordable prices and serves quality food.

Menu Options
- Variety of fast food options
-  juices and shakes available

Ambiance and Service
- Well-maintained premises, despite being roadside
- Friendly and attentive staff
- Arrive early to secure seating, as options are limited and the place gets crowded during peak hours
- Be prepared for limited parking options, as the eatery is situated on a roundabout"
3,It was a pretty good experience the food is flavourful and decent..it is a good and reasonable priced place with friendly ambiance
3,"A good place but don't expect to get parking space in peak hours specially during 6pm to 9pm.
It's a snacks Centre you will get chaat items, sandwiches,pav bhaji and various juice freshly prepared.

* remember but this restaurant take long time to make pizza sandwiches and garlic bread
This place is open to air doesn't  have ample seating  space but as snacks don't take long to consume so you will get a seat to sit. They have chairs and tables so not to worry.
A good place great taste and value for money. Will visit more for their various juices."
4,"Stopped by for a quick milkshake and tried the Sitafal one, absolutely loved it! Just a small heads-up: they charge ‚Çπ10 extra for takeout, which didn‚Äôt really make sense. Still, great spot for a delicious shake!‚Äù"
4,"Best place for chat. If you are a chat lover, you will definitely love this place. Most of the time people give only smashed potato patty and bland ragda in the name of ragda pattice, but this place serves good quality ragda pattice.

They have a wide option of food such as pav bhaji, varieties of dosa, chat, fresh juices, and much more.

This is located in vashi, sector 17, near Mcdonalds.

Things to try -

Ragda pattice, Dahi Puri, Dosas.

Thins not to try -

Fresh but not so fresh juice. You may think you are ordering a fresh juice to gulp down your food but trust me you will be get one small cup of fruit juice diluted with water.

Worst fruit juice and waste of money."
4,"The culinary offerings are delectable.
The establishment is well-suited for a brief repast.
The clientele primarily consists of youthful individuals.
There is a diverse selection of delectable confections available."
4,Great place for Jalebi Fafda in the mornings.
3,"This place is okish for a variety of morning breakfast.
They have a lot of variety such as Jalebi, Samosa, Khammand, Khandvi, fafda, etc.

The taste is not too good but also not too bad. If you don't have any nearby option for breakfast, you can definately visit here once in a while."
3,Farsan items are tasty but costing is high. This shop may sale more goods at cheaper rate which should be affordable to general public.
4,"We ordered samosa and dhokla for one of our function. Since it was a bulk order all the ingredients were prepared freshly. communication from the store stuff was top notch ,They called and confirmed the timing of delivery along with a call to confirm the preparation time.
Though they don‚Äôt provide a delivery you can book any pick up service to have the food delivered to you."
5,"This place has every indian snack that you could imagine and then some. When you're catering to such a large base, it's hard to be authentic to every cuisine. But when you're making food so wholesome and so tasty, you don't have to worry about being authentic (which is a buzzword anyway and doesn't really mean anything).

Vishwa lunch home really does it well when it comes to snacks. The food is tasty, the service is quick, the ambiance is bare minimum and the aesthetic is Spartan. We ordered chhole bhature, idli wada sambar, puri bhaji and chai. Each of those items thoroughly satisfied our cravings on a cool rainy evening. The idlis were fluffy and hot, wada was crispy but soft on the inside, the bhature were huge, chhole gravy was amazing but the chai.. well, the chai was out of this world! It was the right mix of creamy and sweet and not too milky. I truly blessed these people from my heart when I had my cup and I'm sure that you will too!

May this place thrive and be here for many years to come!"
2,Food is good. But service is bad. They never follow instructions.. I ordered masala Dosa and asked them to keep bhaji separate. But they stuffed the bhaji in dosa making it soggy. Even after complaining they don't bother to replace. The owner and staff both are careless in taking orders. And this has happened many times.
3,"Small simple veg hotel. Price is very reasonable but service is very slow
Food is not that tasty"
4,Local udipi restaurant for reasonable and good meals.
4,"Best for breakfast n dinner
All kinds of food
South Indian, North Indian, poha, veg biryani and all
Only veg hotel
Good place for lunch near MGM"
5,Great place to get some protein..... Have been loyal customer for 20+ years no complaints. sells fresh products and good hygiene is maintained in the shop
4,Away from main road and that's the ideal place for food takeaway. Nice food with a good menu in variety.
5,Great place grt food only parcel service
1,Stale food. Just don't go there. I fell sick after eating here.
4,Great for people who like to eat non VEG.. specially Chicken Tandoori
3,"Had order the Egg Roll which comes wrap in tissue paper. Good to taste and very reasonable at Rs 40/- per roll.
If you are a fan of momos then they get steam and fried momos also which are quite reasonable too."
3,"I was in vashi and a friend suggested this place for rolls
Their more like frankie than rolls
Tasted average
I was expecting it to better than this
But not disappointed üòá
Ordered one chicken egg roll and double chiken egg roll"
4,Only rolls...yum yum yum...Rolls which fills Ur tummy with a decent amount of u have promo code then it's  cherry on pie..The parcel is amazingly packed and the quantity and quality both are decent must try it..All the foodie and non foodie too will love the taste of the rolls..they have huge varieties mine is egg rollüî•Cheers and happy rolls‚ù§
1,We ordered panner rolls which is double the price of normal rolls but what we got was onion and a sprinkle of paneer. We had to search for panner in panner roll. Taste is also not good. Its a roll replica of kawa biryani. They dont have water to even clean their utensils.Please avoid.
5,"Best rolls varieties ever, I have been coming to this place from 6- 7 years, it is the best place, Now the name is Kolkatta Rolls , but same taste as always , love the rolls"
2,"Ordered for home delivery. Pizza arrived in record time but at what cost? Well, the dough was properly undercooked and tasted of raw flour. I‚Äôve ordered numerous times from this location and they‚Äôve almost always got something massively wrong."
3,"The place is located on service road adjacent to Vashi.main road

It has around 25 chair sitting arrangement with round tables

Service is good and the food quality is also good"
5,Actually I have visited here I went to this place 3 days ago and overall the pizza was amazing but the service is not really great but it is ok ok type means the sitting arrangement what not clean the branch of Domino's is good in location but the service is not good everywhere the pizza boxes shutter here and there overall experience is very good
1,"Horrible Manager of the Store Kalapak Mane, he served a Pizza adding tamato sause in the base and drop of chees, when complaint he was rude and said ""SOP ke Hisaab se banaya hai yehi milega"" I told him to taste it and see he said nahi aisa hi hota hai complain karo jaha karna hai , I never expected this from Dominos Brand,I have raised a complaint against him with a complaint number Ref 36240020 let's see if Dominos wants to hold their brand name they take right action"
1,"The outlet tells us that for Dine in its open from 12 Noon, which is not mentioned anywhere outside the outlet.
Which is not good. also said AC for dine in will start at 12 noon, customers were going back but no one is bothered üòîüòî"
5,The food was authentic without soda and so tasty yummy and best reasonable food‚Ä¶ We ordered veg which was sufficient for 4 ppl in 400rs‚Ä¶ Rotis Vegetable Dal tadka Zeera Rice in just 470rs with free delivery within Vashi‚Ä¶.add on they provided plates spoons along with achar & onions lemon‚Ä¶Long way to go‚Ä¶Great Foodüòãüòãüòãüòáüëçüèª
5,"Surprisingly great food, although for atmosphere i have given 3 because it's a shady place but they are coming up with a new outlet in sector 10 sooner. Trust me one would think of avoiding this place due to the ambience or the people it attracts, but trust me that this place serves some amazingly tasty food, i would say almost in line or in fact better than some standard restuarants. This is surely a must try. Please go ahead and please your taste buds fellas!"
5,Me and my friends always go there from palava city to eat it's so far away from us but the taste we get from there is unmatched.
1,"The order was Vegetarian Thali. The dal was cold and no salt. The vegetable curry was Black gram (Chana) no spice and salt. The second vegetable was mix vegetable which had no vegetables but just curry, that too was without salt and spice. The menu mentioned free buttermilk but was not provided. The earlier owner was a Bengali Dada whom I personally knew, but he sold to new Sindhi management ( few servers are retained from old management though) I asked for a green chilly as there was no taste at all, but was never served. Bit the most deceitful of all is the dish is priced at Rs. 130.ideally should have been Rs. 80 at the maximum.

Please don't visit."
5,I had been for the time there though the hotel was small but food was very delicious. I had gone for nonveg item the taste was superb. The fish item I ordered was very nice and fresh. I had lunch there but the same day again went there for dinner parcel. Must go nice food . I give full ratings for it.
1,I ordered chicken lollipop from this restaurant on swiggy.. I got white worm ü™±  in lollipop I have attached a pic and when I call restaurant for this they just raised there hand.. they were like swiggy person may be done that stuff..
3,"It's all about business, come drink and go.
Food is okay.
Don't ask about atmosphere, it's bar not for family.
If you planning to visit with friends who don't care about atmosphere and will be happy with the business you came for you will enjoy the place.
It's road touch bar & resturant, so easy to get the cab or auto to reach back home."
4,"‚ÄúThe chicken matka biryani was absolutely amazing! Perfectly balanced flavors, beautifully presented, and cooked to perfection. It‚Äôs a must-try for anyone visiting ‚Äù"
1,Very very bad service. They don't really bother for their customers. They never follow the instructions given to them
5,"This is the place when you are in your budget, service is good, food is good, quantity is good and price is also good."
1,"Worst quality food, kitchen is so dirty with cockroaches roaming around. Food tastes filthy and the quality is also inferior."
2,OkNot good but yet
5,Nice restaurant
5,Good
4,Nice
5,"I had the pleasure of celebrating my first anniversary at Royal Orchid, and I must say, it was an unforgettable experience. From the moment we arrived, the service exceeded all expectations. Restaurant Manager Rizwan and his team provided impeccable service, going above and beyond to make sure every detail was perfect. The buffet was delicious, with a wonderful variety, and the overall experience was much superior to even what we had experienced at Marriott."
4,"Food is good but the hotel is undergoing renovation so the atmosphere is noisy. We had booked table through eatigo. It appears that staff is also limited and the time from order to serving takes long. Food portions are good, taste is good better then our past exp and Italian food was also authentic."
1,"Would like to share horrible and terrifying incident.I had taken my family for dinner @ Echo - Royal Orchid Central Grazia, Vashi. Navi Mumbai on the occasion of  my birthday. I had booked slots for 4 people through Carnival offer. No where in the offer it was mentioned that it was a la carte menu or buffet. We were forced to take their buffet. We were served starters , Chicken Chilly with lot of salt, chicken tikka which was very cold and hard to chew, and also salty Chicken lollipop. The food didn't have the quality, taste at all. We told the Executive about it, but he couldn't help on it. He tried to rectify one dish but again it came very oily.
The cleaniness of the hotel was improper, there were cockroaches roaming around, and when I informed the Manager, the 2-3 executives started playing with those cockroaches as if it was football and were eager to make goals. It was very disgusting to eat food while they were roaming around. By looking at cockroaches my sister and my niece rejected to have her main course food also.
If such insects were roaming in the hall, just wondering how many would be in the kitchen and what kind of food is being prepared which is been served to all
NO GOOD FOOD, NO CLEANINESS, NO CUSTOMER SERVICE NOTHING...
They ruined my entire birthday dinner, and this memory will stay forever.
WOULD SUGGEST DON'T GO TO SUCH A RESTAURANT LOOKONG @ THEIR NAME WHERE INSECTS ARE ROAMING AROUND IN DINING AREA, LOW QUALITY FOOD IS SERVED & NO CUSTOMER SERVICE NOR CUSTOMER SATISFACTION."
5,"this Hotel is having an great , banquet section , good coffee joints too , an Hotel  must be visited . ..."
5,Awesome place to avoid chaos and noise. Quiet and peaceful
1,Its expensive. Booze prices are high. Not at all recommended.
4,"Its a dance bar near orchid hotel.
Teen girls sway on hindi songs.
Some very good dancers are found here"
3,"Place ok for TP.
Parking average
Ambience average
Rate very high as per quality and collection."
5,Good bar nice place
1,"If you want to get fooled, you can go"
5,"Its a take away. So no rating for atmosphere.
One of the best biryani provider in vashi. Authentic food."
1,"Poor quality ,it's just hype created by it's own owner
Tasteless  food. Delay in orders"
1,"This place used to provide one of the best Biryani's once upon a time, but quality has gone down so DRASTICALLY down the years... It's become PATHETIC !

The price remains high but you cant even call it Biryani anymore,  its just steamed rice & few pieces of Chicken & that's it. Its best advisable to stay away from Star Biryani, it simply not worth the money anymore.

Try some other good quality restaurant."
5,"I do order biryani from here frequently. And if you need to end your craving for mouth watering delicious Hyderabadi Biryani this is the place to be. They have the best biryani in Vashi Navi Mumbai for 120 Rs per person.

They provide chicken biryani everyday , mutton biryani every friday and sunday. Vegetable biryani is made to order.

Also the quantity of rice they provide is good with chicken piece.Orders for party / events are also taken."
3,"Taste is not do good, very dry biryani, It used to taste better earlier if not the best but now a days it sucks, there is another biryani in the neighborhood named KGN they have excellent biryani specially tikka biryani."
5,"This small restaurant in Vashi is a hidden gem! The food is insanely good, I've been there a bunch of times. You gotta try their Chaska Maska Tandoori Kebab and Pudina Chaska Chicken Kebab with Butter Garlic Kulcha, it's mouthwatering and scrumptious. The prices are reasonable and the service is quick. The owner and staff are super friendly."
5,"Attention Navimumbaikars !!
I‚Äôve got an amazing recommendations for you !!

Masala Wok in vashi where Chinese and Indian flavours blend seemlesly,

Start with The lip smacking  chicken cheese wontons which I highly recommend and indukge in the irresistible chaska maska tandoori and Chinese starters

Movin on to the main course The handmade noodles, Malaysian pot rice, kepssa rice Sherpa rice are a gastronomic delight

The comfy ambience and a dedicated family section make it perfect for special occasions
Whether it‚Äôs a special day or just a craving for great food Maslaa wok is the place to be

follow me for more food recommendations"
4,I had Malaysian prawn pot rice and Honey seasem noodle ice cream. Loved the pot rice a lot. It's was yummy and it tasted different from the usual Chinese food taste which I had come to expect. It was filled with gravy and had good amounts of prawn. Also the honey seasem noodle was good too. It had lots of quantity. It's something different I had tried. Loved it. It was a stomach filler for sure. I went there around 10 pm and it was quite empty. Service was good too. Only issue I had was the water. It's best of you ask for bisleri bottle. It had thread like stuff floating in the water. We changed twice later requested for bottled water. Overall ambience was fine. I feel I need to try their other stuff too.
5,"This place is a heaven for those who crave for authentic asian food, have tried out a variety of dishes that I'd only heard of. The owner is one great host and the staff is great too. Priced reasonably for the quality and service, the place is also well setup but, could have a little more lights to matchup the interiors. Overall a great place in vashi if you're a fan of asian & continental food. My experience so far has been great. Cheers."
1,"Disappointing Experience
I went to masala wok with high hopes after reading good reviews. Sadly, the food was not good. The chicken was not cooked properly, and the gravy had too much sauce but very few chicken pieces. The prices were very high for the small portions we got. Overall, it was a disappointing visit, and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place."
1,"I ordered prawns biryani from the SHALIMAR RESTAURANT. Upon consuming the food, I discovered a live insect in the dish, which is not only unhygienic but also poses a serious health risk. The incident has caused me extreme distress and concern regarding food safety standards. I Never trust this hotel again."
2,I‚Äôm extremely disappointed with my order of Chicken Chilli. The chicken was completely raw and unsafe to eat. This is not just poor service ‚Äî it's a serious health hazard. Serving raw chicken shows a shocking lack of basic food safety standards and quality control. I expect a full refund and a proper explanation of how such a careless mistake was allowed to happen. This kind of negligence is unacceptable.
5,Amazing food and very good service. Must Visit.
3,"I had visited these place few days ago.just wanted to share my experience with you. Shalimar do not have much options for vegetarians..entire menu is filled with non vegetarian dishes..i tried both of them and found that shalimar stands down in terms of taste. I can say that food is average tasting and rates are bit high..

If you are looking for good interior and calm atmosphere then do visit this place..seats and tables are best for photogenic people but failed to satisfy the food expectations. I had visited their Bhendi Bazar branch and did found ssme experience.

Biggest complaint with utensil cleanlyness. Dirty glasses where searved."
3,Service is good. But needs improvement in taste and cleanliness. Kebabs were good but gravy was bit sweet. Also had a small baby insect wandering near our dining table.
4,"Hidden Gem in Vashi üìç
Do order their Starters and signature dishes ‚ù§Ô∏èThe food was definitely tasty and each dish was unique‚Ä¶They have a cozy ambience ü´∂üèªDo visit and enjoy your day üôÇ"
4,The food was good. Pina colada was not the Pina colada I expected. Lolipop was ok. Mutton Biryani was super tasty and chicken lababdar. I made a reservation as it was a weekend.
3,"I have visited this place many times amazing place to chill out with friends.Pocket friendly rates and  satisfactory service. I don't drink alcohol but simply the food, the vibe and the sweet staff it has made the experience more memorable. Always served delicious food ambience is ok ok. It's famous for kebabs

5,Quiet place with a nice ambience. The food was very tasty and served well. One of the good places to visit in vashi
4,It's a calm place in a crowded city like Vashi. It's situated in isolated but with enough place for parking. The ambience and service are good. You will get your food served in time. The hotel provides a good ambience and projector as well. There dine in discounts as well in the afternoon. Check in directly rather than book it from Zomoto.
4,"We visited this place for evening snacks
As soon as we entered the restaurant it feels like pleased and refreshing due to the aromatic sticks fragrance
The food is delicious and prices are also cheap
The ambiance of restaurant is simple but pleasant
Overall its good restaurant , definitely recommended"
3,"The restaurant is known for serving North Indian food.

I tried ‚ÄòAmar‚Äôs Special Veggies‚Äô, ‚ÄòDal Makhni‚Äô along with mix veg kulcha and tandoori naan. The food tasted average and service was a bit slow."
3,The Best Pav Bhaji & Masala Pav in Mumbai. Always repeat your order to your Waiters as they take orders verbally.
4,"We had masala papad, pani puri and chilli mili dosa and manchow soup.
Food was okay"
5,"Recently visited Amar Restaurant for a small get-together with friends, and it was a delightful experience! The ambience is cozy and welcoming, perfect for a relaxed meal.

Started with the vegetable soup and noodle soup; both were flavorful and a great start to the meal. For starters, had the kebabs, which were delicious. For the main course, tried the butter naan with paneer pasanda and kofta gravy. To top it all off, had the sizzling brownie for dessert.

Overall, it's a must-visit spot for both friends and family. Highly recommended! üåü"
4,"I recently visited Taste of Punjab and had an amazing experience! The buffet spread was impressive, with a wide variety of options to suit every palate. From chaat to starters, main course, and desserts, there was something for everyone.

The non-veg options, including chicken and mutton, were good, although I felt the mutton could have been cooked to perfection. However, the desserts were a highlight - delicious.

What truly stood out was the warm hospitality and excellent service. The staff made me feel right at home, ensuring a comfortable and enjoyable dining experience.

Overall, Taste of Punjab is a great spot for those looking to indulge in authentic Punjabi cuisine. I would definitely recommend it!

Veg is INR 900 and Non Veg is INR 1000 per person

P.S : you might want to include prawns in the starters."
5,"Went on a lunch with team . The food and Ambience sound totally like punjabi restaurant and also decorations are similar.
Music is playing in mid sound which is shooting to ears and thus create a great atmosphere to sit together, eat ,chat and enjoy. However non veg food was average but veg food was great and tasteful.
If you planning to visit with team or bog group ots a great choice to choose from .
Would highly recommend veg food and side dishes. Sweets were awesome and delicious. Must vist for veg options

For those who love non veg: it‚Äôs a good choice to visit.
For vegetarian people it‚Äôs not a good choice.

On non veg too limited options.
Taste of starters is good.
Main course is Okok.

Bhangra performance was entertaining.

Service is really really slow.
You have to ask them again and again about something.

Overall it‚Äôs Okok restaurant."
5,"We recently discovered Taste of Punjab, a hidden gem in Vashi, and we're still raving about the incredible experience! This restaurant offers an unparalleled culinary journey through the flavors of Punjab.

The buffet is a must-try! With an impressive spread of dishes, including authentic Punjabi cuisine, desserts, and refreshing drinks, you'll want to come back for more. The variety is staggering, and the quality is exceptional.

But what truly sets Taste of Punjab apart is its live Bhangra performances! The energy is electric, and the dancers' enthusiasm is infectious. You'll be clapping along and having the time of your life!

The service is top-notch, with friendly and attentive staff who ensure your dining experience is nothing short of exceptional. The ambiance is warm and inviting, making it perfect for family gatherings, celebrations, or corporate events.

In short, Taste of Punjab is a must-visit destination for foodies and anyone looking for an authentic Punjabi experience. Don't miss out on this culinary delight!"
2,"Taste of Punjab, vashi must have been an amazing place when it first opened, but over time, it seems to have lost its charm. The infrastructure feels outdated, and there‚Äôs a noticeable lack of maintenance. The space itself is decent, but the interiors and setup look old and in need of a refresh. Just look at the ceiling, and you‚Äôll feel bad, it really needs some attention. The entry is very confusing and looks lost, plaza inside is not well maintained

As for the food, it‚Äôs good but not great definitely not something that justifies the ‚Çπ1200-1400 price tag. Given the condition of the place, the pricing feels a bit steep. If they could improve the ambiance and upkeep, it might be worth it. For now, it‚Äôs just an okay experience rather than a standout one.

Management, you need to pay attention renovate."

4,"One and only kind of place  for folks in Reliable tech park, Airoli mindspace.  After trying many happening places in vashi, we gave a try for this place and it really worth it. This place was full even on Wednesday night. Food (veg and non veg) both good. Not lot of choice in desserts though. Music and ambiance are perfect for party animals. They play Bollywood music on weekends which turns the floor into dance floor. Staff is really good at service and hospitality. (Like many pubs they don't allow shorts and sleepers for men but for foreigners same is allowed)"
4,"I went to this place with my office colleagues for lunch. The place is a bit dark (which i liked), with good music. They have a brewery too..Yaay!
The food is okay-ish and goes with the drink.

5,"This is a nice place to hangout with colleagues. Variety of drinks are available. Food is not extraordinary, but okay. The service is quite good and courtesies. Ambience is also nice, and the place is more lively as the night progresses. In a nutshell good place to have booze with friends and colleagues."

Ratings :

Drinks were good upto the mark properly prepared not so sweet no so tanggy... well balanced ..

About the food ... for some reason i was not that satisfied reasons ;
1. Foods served wasn't that hot... may not hot would be fine word. Thus the taste was not coming to the mark for smreasn ...
2. Quantity was only serving for one person

Taste wise the food was well balanced but a lil bit hot food enhances the spices and taste definitely...

Overall good place to visit for lunch and snacks good drinks great ambience visit...

Do visit ...

All the best BARWORKS team...

See you soon .."
3,This restaurant is only available for the employees working in mindspace Airoli Navi Mumbai and other out people are not allowed. It is a big nicely organized restaurant and they also take events parties of companies. The only problem is they don't know how to handle huge crowd on weekends and at the end of the they end up with a bad service . Normally on weekdays this restaurant remains empty and with proper service coming upon on the rates I think it is over rated.
4,"The food here is really good, loved the ambience!"
2,"This hotel is located inside the mindspace Airoli premises where multiple IT companies are functional , on Thane Belapur Road, near to Airoli railway station.  Only close by hangout  place for employees working in the Mindspace campus, not visible from main road. Security does not allow general public to enter premises.
Generally wait time -15 to 30 min during lunch time on Wednesdays/ Fridays / Occasion.
Multiple Choices of North Indian,  Veg -Non-Veg dishes, Chinese options are available.
Open for  Lunch &  Dinner
Buffet Lunch is also available
Price : $$
Service : Slow, Poor , Lot of attitude , Reminders needed
Ambience : Good

My Experience :
Cons üò•
I had gone for lunch on Women's day , had to wait more than 30 min and sad part queue was not organised
Management Chaos... since sequence of Waiting list was not followed looks like can not handle the rush.
Main Course (bhatti ka Murg) which was suggested by Stewart was not at all good in taste. Chicken pieces were very small and too spicy.
Need multiple reminders on couple of basic items
No coordination between hotel staff
Indian Bread ( garlic naan & Rooti ) were not served hot and were very dry and hard (like papad)
Stopped giving discounts for companies.
Pros üòÄ
Sitting area facility both Inside & Outside
Starter  Chicken Tikka which we ordered was really soft and tender and nice taste. I enjoyed having it

Not recommended if you have time and can go out of campus and try out other restaurants."
1,"The grapevine restaurant is situated inside Mindspace. We used to go regularly here. In the starting days we find food to be of good quality. But slowly later on they reduced the quality. Service is too long to wait to get the food.
They had increased the price like anything. Charging more money on cold drinks than mrp. Food quantity and quality is not upto the mark as per the pricing.

Also they use same oil for veg/Non veg.

Also one cashier sitting at the counter behaves very rudely.
I don't know if it's their nature or the owner forces them to do so.
The rest,  ambience is very good. Have enough space to accommodate a large number of gatherings. Can host events as well."
4,"Some food items are of good quality but some or not... I am exploring their dishes.. Kebabs are literally worth it... Chicken Boneless Biryani is also very tasty and worth the price... Don't try Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani/ Hyderabadi Paneer Biryani, it's a waste of money... Overall food quality and quantity is good, but depends on what you are ordering... The average cost for 1 person is around ‚Çπ200 to ‚Çπ500..."
1,I request you guys not to order from fassos they deliver wrong order and there is invalid number when we try to call to raise the complaint to call them it shows invalid no and also zomato customer service is not good we have placed an order for 8 inches shawarma but we received 6 inches shawarma and we tried to raise a complaint we tried to call them but it was invalid no it's very fake people works here fraud thinks we are never going to order anything from fassos Airoli branch fassos its very frustrating all Branches of fassos should develop there service and please add correct number if any one else want to call or raise a complaint we request you to give us a call
5,The food was very good delivery wad very fast & we got the wrap from the best chef Nisha!!
1,Worst quality food at higher price don't eat
5,The food is served hot and fresh. We have ordered Veg Rice Feast and Veg Delight which tasted yum! Faasos has a variety of Rice Feasts and Wraps. They also take online orders. It was a good experience. Looking forward to visiting this place again and explore the rest of the menu.
5,"Serves some tasty food which is packed nicely and delivered piping hot. They also have a lot of offers going on specially on Friday's and weekends when generally people order the most. For the variety of items in their patented feast, it is a steal and worth every penny. A must try is the chicken overloaded meal if you are too hungry or the Veg feast if you have something light."
1,"I went to this restaurant, but it wasn‚Äôt good. The menu was boring and had very few choices. It was hard to find something I wanted to eat because there weren‚Äôt many options.
The seating was nice. The first floor had air conditioning, which made it cool and comfortable. The place looked good and felt okay, even with lots of people.
But the food was bad. There were many customers, but the chicken smelled old and not fresh. This made the meal unpleasant. A busy restaurant should serve fresh food, but they didn‚Äôt.
The staff was not good either. They didn‚Äôt seem to care and moved slowly. We waited a long time for our food, and when we asked for help, they took forever to respond.
In the end, this restaurant needs to get better. They should add more items to the menu, make sure the food is fresh, and have staff that work faster and care more. The nice seats and air conditioning are not enough to make up for these problems. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll come back unless they fix things."
1,"We recently visited this restaurant for dinner, but unfortunately, the experience was disappointing. The food quality did not meet expectations. We ordered Chicken Tawa and chicken very big, but it was undercooked and had an unusually sweet taste, similar to a dessert. Other dishes had the same issue. Additionally, the service was not up to the mark. Despite paying the full amount, the meal was not worth the price. I hope the management takes this feedback seriously and improves both food quality and service."
2,I ordered a fruit salad and I'm still trying to find out why is there Khoya (Mawa) in it instead of ice cream of cream also where are the fruits it's only pineapple and pomegranate which tastes pathetic with khoya(mawa) and chocolate sauce.
5,"A nice place to enjoy with family and friends..
Do try their chicken broast & chicken kolhapuri gravy.."
1,"My experience at hasan Sahil Hotel was extremely disappointing...

*AC Room*: The room‚Äôs cooling was almost non-existent.
*Service*: Waiters were slow to take our order and inattentive throughout our meal.
*Food*: The shawarma was awful, with a bad smell and unpleasant taste.
*Table Management*: While others were allowed to sit long after finishing, we were rushed to pay and leave immediately after eating.
*Waiter‚Äôs Attitude*: The waiter was rude and unprofessional.

Overall, this place needs serious improvements in service, food quality, and customer treatment. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone..."
5,"Tried Chicken Fried Rice, Taste is very good, They made me experience the taste of one of my favourite hotels of my childhood, I'll definitely order food from here, better to visit and eat there."

2,"Tasteless food is served over here think twice before visiting. Their seekh is dry and tasteless, eating it makes your mouth dry and feels like eating raw meat. Hygiene is also an imaginary concept for these people.

Think twice before visiting here and waste your money, many other eateries are better and worth your price."
1,worst thing was the person who taken ordered and money was dranked.how we can belive him.i asking something he given awnser something else.I was asking for  delivery he agreed but not took my details then I told him take add details.after payment delivery team asking money bcz he didn't inform him to delivery team that payment already done.
1,"""I had a terrible experience at Lajawab Seekh Paratha Restaurant. The chicken they served was clearly old‚Äîstored for days, with a foul smell and a greyish color that made it completely unappetizing. The quality was awful, and it ruined the entire meal. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place to anyone‚Äîavoid it at all costs!"""

1,"Ordered fried rice through chrisfood app.
Pathetic quality. Ordered chicken fried rice but there was no chicken. And taste was so pathetic.
One can buy more tasty chicken fried rice better than this on road side in 50 Rs.
Request people avoid ordering from Hungry stomach Amrut Nagar.
If u have lot of money and u r ok to waste it then go for it.
Disastrous experience."
1,"Literally the worst restaurant in mumbra. They don't even deserve 1 start rating. I ordered my food at 10.30 and it's 11.45 now but i didn't receive my order yet. Very pathetic management and service. Shut your restro and open a vada pav stall, it'll be easy for you guys to manage!!!!"

yesterday I ordered some rice and noodles but all the things were tasteless and the rice smells very bad ! it was very disappointed that first time ever the food from our favourite restraunt is no more tasty...its just a combination of some colour and veggies"

and i said it put more vegitable last tym there is no vegitable and not goo prepare but at this time is also same condition no chicken, no vegitable and not proper boiled also.
If you not make proper then tell known the customer if you dont have any thing avilable at your shop then also tell to the customer.

I SUGGEST TO ALL DONT BUY FROM HERE
IT TAKES TO MUCH TIME  AND MAKE FOOD PROPERLY.TIME WASTE PLUS IRRITATION."

It is a nice spot for a family dinner. The ambience is pleasant, though the dining area is a bit congested, but the seats are quite comfortable. Be prepared to wait around 10-15 minutes for a table during the weekend. They also have dastarkhwan for 15 people.

The service is quick, although the staff didn't serve the food (likely due to the busy hours), but they were prompt in bringing everything we requested.

The food was decent overall. We ordered crispy chicken, malai kebab, prawns plain fry, and zamzam pulao. The crispy chicken stood out as the best among these, while the zamzam pulao tasted a bit more like a Chinese dish. A disappointment.

The tea here is absolutely amazing and highly recommended!

Will visit again surely"
1,"1) The food is overpriced and not worth the quantity.
2) The ambiance is very noisy and not a peaceful environment to sit in.
3) The taste of food is very average. The soup was the worst.
4) we have found a house fly in a glass of water. So pathetic in terms of hygiene.
5) only the staff is very kind and polite."

Food deserve 5 stars, quantity, Quality, Price is just great.
Services- So kind staff.
Ambience is awesome. Specially the family area at 1st floor. Such a great way they have design which gives privacy to all the tables.
Here I had Schezwan tandoori, fried rice and falooda and everything was delicious.
I couldn't try any other dish as my Tummy was full after iftaar.
Price of dishes also very much affordable."

4,"Went there with office friends for dinner. We had inquired and pre-booked our table, and the staff was quite helpful and welcoming from the beginning. if you are visiting buy their Happy Hours vouchers from the website to get a good discount.
We started with the starters, which kept coming one after the other‚Äîjust unlimited! As soon as we finished one, the next would arrive at our table. Among the highlights were the fish barbeque and prawns barbeque‚Äîboth were absolutely delicious. The veg starters also had a good variety and were enjoyable. Since we also wanted to try the main course, we had to stop the starters. The main course offered a wide range of rice and curry dishes. The quantity was great, but the taste was just average. Tried many items, but none stood out as exceptional. There was also a variety of salads and desserts. Again, most of them were just okay, but the Payasam in the dessert section was the clear winner for me. and they served a mango dip with the starters that tasted exactly like aamras. At the end of the meal, they surprised us with a complimentary cake, which was a lovely gesture.
The service was excellent. The staff was polite, attentive, and made sure we were taken care of throughout the evening. One odd thing, though‚Äîthere was no washroom inside, which was quite strange for a place of this scale.
Great place for groups, especially if you're going for the unlimited menu. Starters and service were the best parts of the experience. Main course and desserts were decent but not remarkable. So its like tummy was completely filled but main course taste wise didnt hit the mark."
5,"This was my first time visiting Barbeque Nation and it was a good experience. Food quality is awesome. Service is awesome. Atmosphere is awesome.
Their Pani puri is sooo Good. Dessert platter too is unmatched. Prawns, chicken, fish was also good. Also their Staff is very well trained and quite patient.
But Price tag of Rs1200  per head is feels bit more costly. It is a  must visit place."
4,"My eating experience at BBQ  was fantastic! The ambiance was cozy and welcoming as soon as I came in. The personnel was exceedingly cordial and meticulous, ensuring that every aspect was flawless. Every item was savory, fresh, and exquisitely presented, and the food was just delicious. Biryani was exceptional, and I strongly suggest trying it! Everything tasted homemade using premium ingredients, and the portions were substantial. Whether you were celebrating a special occasion or just going out for a casual supper, the atmosphere was ideal for a restful meal. I will most certainly return, and I heartily endorse it to anyone seeking an amazing eating experience!"
5,"The food is of good quality and taste. The staff is very trained and regularly ask for your feedback to help improve your experience. The starters has a wide range (and like most buffet places you will fill your stomach with these). The main course and salad range is decent, there are a couple of live counters and a limited range of dessert. The only downside is that the menu does not change that often making the food redundant and you wouldnt repeat it often or have it as your go to restaurant for food. Going after long gaps would be the way to keep the experience fresh."
5,"As always we enjoy our meal time at Barbeque nation. This time we visited the outlet at Koram mall. Our dinning experience was made more wholesome by the hospitality of the manager Subash and senior GSA Jabbar.
Thank you for kind hospitality and wonderful food."

Paneer Sanghai: 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è
Indo-Chinese Sizzler: 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è

The food was incredibly satisfying and bursting with flavor. However, I suggest the mocktails could use some improvement in quality or a price reduction to match. Overall, we had a fantastic time. The ambience was clean and inviting, featuring large mirrors and photogenic spots. We really enjoyed our visit. Overall, 4.5/5."
4,"‚Ä¢Nice restaurant

4,"I had visited this restaurant with family. It has plenty of options in the menu with a good ambience. We ordered pepper coriander soup, palak cream soup, veg croquettes, rawas amritsari tikka, shelter special chicken, methi malai matar, roti, naan and veg fried rice. The food was very tasty. Good in quality and quantity. In desserts, we ordered caramel custard and sizzling brownie. The palak soup, rawas amritsari tikka and caramel custard is a must try. The veg fried rice needs to be improved in taste by using finer rice and vegetables used should be chopped fine instead of medium cut. The service was very good and fast. I recommend this restaurant."
5,Amazing experience I had this time...this is my 4th time visit and I was really impressed by the new look and interior. It's just so nice sobber and classy. It's importance for a restaurant serving good food but it's also important a good ambiance and here am really overwhelmed by the renovation. Obviously no surprise with the good taste of the food. This time we tried new dishes and again it's just wow.... Have ordered chees corn ball for my kiddo but I couldn't stop myself to have it after tasting. The mix fried rice was heavenly delicious. We love to visit this restaurant again and again.
4,"A very nice rooftop ambience with great food is how I will describe this restaurant. The chicken was soft and tender. Even the soup was thick and tasty. The service was good as well. They also have a great list of mocktails. But this restaurant could be bit heavy on your pocket. Apart from that everything is good.

Subway employer even doesn‚Äôt care to take order especially during weekend.
I asked for Veg delight option i got replied that i have to wait for 15 min as they were serving and entertaining only non veg item only.Even there employee was also rude to talk.
If such is the case then SUBWAY should serve  only non veg and stop veg.

Really pathetic service will never ever try SUBWAY now"

All the items on the menu are super tasty and the Austrian mud pie is to die for.

This restaurant has the most exotic crepes, croissants and a wide range of desserts to choose from.

The ambience is not super luxury so don't go there if you just need pics for Instagram go there if you want to enjoy some really great cuisine."
4,The food was quite nice. Even the presention of the food is very delightful. The place is very cute and cozy. The subtle music was also calming music and nothing commercial. I really appreciate that. Parking is available right outside the entire mall. It's open till late an night which is very convenient.
5,"We followed google reviews and decided to order from The Kitchen. And to our expectations, the food was amazingly good and tempting. We tried fish fry, biryani some starters and that was just perfect for our small house party.
So then went to try the place and to our surprise we even got served one of the best Green Thai Curry in town.
Now, my go to place in Thane."
1,"It was overall a bad experience, I ordered food online late at night, but The food was bland and lacked flavor. Definitely not worth the price...Definitely not worth the hype or the cost. There are better places nearby."
4,"This place serves good tandoor items. We tried chicken tandoori and reshmi kebab and it was very tasty, the chicken in tandoori was especially juicy. The service was a bit slow. Positive about this place is that it serves food even after midnight."
4,"Ordered take out from here multiple times, both Chinese n desi food. It was all packed very well. Chinese was delicious, right from lollipops to noodles, fried rice to chicken dishes, everything was top notch. The Mughlai dishes were good but it could be better. Chicken dum biryani was very dry, felt like it was re-heated, chicken lasooni n chicken bhuna were awesome. I was craving for a biryani and that turned out disappointing.
Will try biryani again to see if this was a 1-time issue or regular occurrence."
5,"The Kitchen- Name itself says that it will be the hub of culinary experts. Two chef/Owners running the show so we know for sure that you will end up having great culinary experience. Food quality, taste and quantity all 3 things won my heart. Balanced flavours in each dish was key point throught my dining.  Strongly recommend this restaurant either visit here if you in nearby area or order the food online, as can easily say one of the best food they serve in that area.
Location- Located in vsant vihar area of thane, can say one of the most popular area in thane. So easily assessable. (4.5/5)

Theme- They serve the most loved food what Mumbai eats, North indian and Chinese cuisine. (5/5)

Food-  Whenever we go to a restaurant we always search for our own comfort food. So here The Kitchen serves us the comfort food which we crave for. We mumbaikars explore lot many cuisines but the one which we enjoy most is north indian like tandoori dishes, mughali curries and on other hand love Chinese starters and main courses. Menu is curated by the owners and chefs Mr. Aniket and Mr. Ram so it has to be perfect. You will see so many options to choose from in the menu card. Certainly the staff will guide you to choose the best dish. Menu consists of innovative dishes and comfort zone dishes both. Innovations like white chicken Tandoori, spicy basil chicken.  Food taste was extremely delicious. The flavouring and marinations were upto the mark. Portion size of each dish is generous too. If you are group then would suggest to order platter as you can enjoy different variety in it.(5/5)

‚Ä¢	WHITE CHICKEN TANDOORI(Starter)-  chicken legs,thighs and breast marinated in white masala and then cooked in tandoor. Something really different, not spicy but had good balancing of masalas, curd and cooked to the perfection. A kind of middle eastern touch given to the dish. A must order this if you want to try something different and loves tandoori.(5/5)

‚Ä¢	KALI MIRI KEBAB( Starter)- Perfect boneless kababs to order. Flvoured with good amount of black pepper and cooked soft enough which can melt in mouth.(5/5)

‚Ä¢	CHICKEN JAMUNI KEBAB(Starter)- Boneles chicken chunks marinated in indian masalas and beetroot paste then cooked in the tandoor. Had dark red colour and were sweetish in taste.(4/5)

‚Ä¢	TANDOORI LOLLYPOP(Starter)- Chicken wings cut/processed in lollypop style and then marinated with tandoori marination resulting in perfect starter to order for non vegetarian lovers. (5/5)

‚Ä¢	PRAWN SUKKA(Starter)- Ultimate coastal dish, prawns tossed in coconut milk and good amount of coriander flavour. Enjoyed the size of prawns which they served. Well balanced flavours were impressive.(5/5)

‚Ä¢	CHICKEN TERIYAKI(Starter)- Chicken chunks tossed in a soya, oyster sauce along with good amount of spring onions, peppers and then garnished with white sesame seeds. A good option to try in aisan, sweet and little tangy dish was excellent.(4.5/5)

‚Ä¢	MUTTON AMRITSARI (Main course)- A must order main course from the menu. Mutton cooked perfectly in the cashew based gravy, light but super rich and well balanced spice. We ordered garlic naan which can be perfect combo with it. Gravy was really impressive, thick and delicious.(5/5)

‚Ä¢	CHICKEN IN WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE- (Asian Main course)- Chicken chunks cooked in medium thick sauce made from Worcestershire sauce. Worcestershire is English sauce which gives tangy/sweet taste to the sauce. Consistency of gravy was spot on here.(5/5)

‚Ä¢	SPICY BASIL RICE(Main course)- Asian gravy should follow by the fried rice isn‚Äôt it. Fried rice made with good amount of basil in it and garnish with fried chilly. (4.5/5)"
3,"The Chicken Lollipop and Mushroom Manchurian were decent choices for starters, reminiscent of the flavors found in local street-style Chinese cuisine. While they satisfied our cravings, they didn't quite leave a lasting impression.

Moving on to the main course, we opted for the Triple Chicken Fried Rice, a generous portion that proved to be ample enough to satiate two hungry appetites. However, in terms of taste, it fell into the category of typical street-style Chinese fare found at countless restaurants.

If you find yourself in need of a meal and have limited options available, this place might suffice to fill your hunger. However, we do not strongly recommend it if you're seeking an extraordinary dining experience."
4,This place is located near khopat bus stop it's not a big hotel or restaurant it's a small 6 table Chinese centre. The menu is quite obvious. Includes all varieties of Chinese food and delicacies. This Chinese centre serves both vegetarian and non vegetarian food. Price is quite reasonable and quantity is justified to the amount paid. The best we taste was the vegetarian manchow soup and fried rice. They serve cold drinks and mineral water too. The service was nice and ambience is simple. It is quite visible from road. They deliver to places nearby and it is free of cost  ATM is next to this place. Please visit this place it's worth having a try.
3,"It's a average Chinese restaurant to have rice and noodles.
Staff is courteous and provide customization in your dishes like no color, ajinomoto,less oil and all.
We had Drum heaven chicken rice which comes with red gravy topped with lollipops, which where good in size. Gravy and rice was so so.
Earlier we had soups here which are good.
Go ahead do try once nothing special but good for TP."
5,"It's Nice place for authentic Chinese food , Service is amazing , staff is humble and atmosphere is also nice ."
1,"I'm went there for first time Very bad experience ordered manchaw soup and chiken combination rice , soup is tasty but rice was tasteless and I told them but didn't get any response the were speechless big no for spice n wok food look delicious but not tasty üëé"
5,"This is a great spot for mouthwatering, 'gharguti' seafood in Dahanu! The crowds thronging outside this small eatery on any day are a testament to its quality and popularity. We had the Gholicha kalwan and a kolambi sukke with tandulachi bhakri followed by rice. I can't wait for my next visit to Darya Sagar!"
5,"Darya Sagar is a hidden gem! I was really impressed by the quality of the food and the speed of service. Every dish we ordered was full of flavor, freshly prepared, and served piping hot. The menu has a great variety, catering to both traditional and modern tastes. What stood out the most was how quickly everything was brought to the table without compromising on quality. The staff was friendly, attentive, and made sure we were comfortable throughout our meal. It's clear that they care about both their food and their customers. Highly recommend Darya Sagar for anyone who appreciates good food and efficient service!"
4,"My recent visit to Dariya Sagar was decent. The ambience was okay, and the service was acceptable, although there were some delays. I didn't like climbing upstairs.

The food was average, nothing particularly outstanding. Portion was also very minimal.  Overall, it's an okay option if you're in the area, but nothing great to write about."
4,Grt experience quality food service is also grt friendly staff explained it well regarding food but not on weekends as there too much rush and service slows down drastically
3,Decent place to have seafood but the Ambience looks dated now. It was a great option for seafood lovers back then but since the fine dine concept has come this outlet requires upliftment. The food taste is great no doubt.
1,"The only good thing about Boneless Chicken Biryani, it was hot. Nothing else. The service was slow, the biryani had no taste, the price was too expensive for the quantity and quality, the raita was weird, had to drop it in the bin.
Please AVOID!"
1,"Today we ordered Chicken Shawarma and Chicken dum biryani and we were disappointed to see the portion size as well as the quality of the food.

Rise was basmati on top and overcooked, low quality rice at the bottom. The food was tasteless.

If you do not want regret then don't buy anything from them."
1,"Chicken tikka Biryani just had. Absolutely worst taste, the rice is completely sour and masala is pathetic and very ü•µ hot and chicken is also I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs used. Had here before as well but this is probably why I‚Äôll skip chicken tikka Biriyani for a while now. Very bad experience 341‚Çπ wasted"
1,"Paid 210 for an average bland wrap. When requested for some green chutney, they asked to pay 30 Rs for it üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ This was at Viviana Mall.

P.S the chutney too was bland."
2,Rice is good masala is good but chicken is very dry.. it seems like they have cooked Stale chicken. And just mixed it with gravy. I read the biryani 2/5. Not recommended for 359+rs order
4,"A very good place to taste various types of parathas. They have lot of options like traditional parathas as well as fusion.
Cost for two is less than 300/- so its very pocket friendly place.
Only the issue is space is very small which can not cater bigger groups and there is issue for parking in pick hours"
5,"For Paratha lovers, this is the best place. This serves more than 50+ varieties of Parathas with khichdi, chhole bhature and veg. thali. The staff is also very friendly. Based on your requirement and inputs, they will suggest you Paratha.

We tried Veg. Manchurian , Veg. Pizza , Veg. Chilli Garlic and Paneer Peri Peri Parathas. You must try Manchurian and Pizza Parathas.

Overall : must recommend"
4,"The paratha house offers a good number of varieties of stuffed parathas. We tried paneer peri peri, cheese garlic, schezwan manchurian paratha. The paneer peri peri was the best, well stuffed and tasted extremely good.  Schezwan Manchurian paratha was also good'. The parathas are served along with a huge plate containing all kinds of sauces and chutneys. Ambience is ok and nothing much to be talked about but visit this place for the good taste of parathas. We also tried dahi vada which was fine.  Between 4 of is we paid Rs. 1000 and it was value for money.
We visited at 1 pm and wait time was 15 minutes."
3,It was all good until This place used to have a complimentary bowl of butter on each table for customers but discontinued it recently. Now you have to buy a separate butter at 20rs/sachet. Food quality has also gone down slightly. The on-table food is served half an hour after the opening time. It'll be a good eating place if the old management comes back and runs the place as it were previously.
1,Please do not order from here. They are serving stale food. I ordered 2 parathas and the green thechchaa had FUNGUS.
4,Abhiman restaurant and Flight is near to cadbury junction. You can enjoy also here the flight ambience experience. Food is good. Quality will be more better... Service is not so great service person not welcome you and serve you good and not allocate your sit as per your comfortable.
4,"Flight like seating set up is something, this restaurant us known for !! However, we were seated at non flight section - the general setup !

We loved the starters - Tandoori chicken and decent main course - butter chicken and butter naan"
5,"The food is very tasty, specially the biryani and the spices taste amazing, their service is also very good"
4,"Visited the plane themed sitting. The imitation of plane is very well made. Gets you the feeling of sitting in a plane. The service is slow though. Food tastes good but don't know for what reason it felt uneasy after sometime.
Overall good experience."
5,"What a wonderful ambience & amazing service, felt like I'm actually in an airplane. Food was amazing & per person cost was a bit on the higher end. AC & lights were not too dim or not too bright."
4,Best place for Frankie. Both veg and non veg Frankie available with variety of options. It is present in the food court of Viviana Mall. The service is quick
5,"The best thing about this Frankie is the taste.Its masaledar and fulfills the cravings for frankie.

1,"I am not from India and I specifically ask for non spicy food, it is ok to be spicy but it‚Äôs not okay for them to sell it as ‚Äúwe can make 0 spicy‚Äù. Not good"
1,"Ordered Ragda Pattice and dahi puri from Zomato today sometime back.Chose Kailash Parbhat restaurant. I am sure it must have come from your R Mall Majiwada outlet, Thane West. The dahi puri was okay. Could have been better , keeping in mind your taste.The pattice was big heart shaped very hard, completely uncooked. It was not even breaking properly, fully uncooked and outer layer was stiff very surprising. First time in my life I had seen a pattice so hard to break. I did not want to fall sick, so unfortunately threw in my bin. I felt extremely bad because I never waste food but I was compelled to do so. Forgive me God.Chhole gravy was absolutely poor in taste and salty so I added curds and just had the gravy without those so called 2 pattice. Sad. Never expected something like this from a brand like Kailash Parbhat. I have often eaten at your Colaba main outlet. Extremely disappointed."
5,"Yesterday we were at kailash parbat which is located in Viviana mall, thane West , its a cool and attractive place, this place is famous for their chaats even they serve dishes like chole, pav bhaji and combos to, they take all safety measures before serving the order, even the staffs are humble towards their customers.

4.Mango lassi:-Mango lassi was bitter in taste, the sweetness was no where in mango lassi we didn't like it soo much it was ok."
5,"We just thought of trying Kailash Prabhat as it‚Äôs known for its chat and snacks.
They have amazing variety of chats, we tried Bombay basket which is so delicious. Mixture of all flavours. Also the tikki chat is a must try.
They have taken care of all hygiene and the service is quick .

Kailash parbat is  located on the second floor of Viviana Mall in  Thane West. All the food that I had during this visit, was presented really well. I always love to try their different chaat offerings. Dahi wada that I had was just so soft and so delicious. Chole bhatura combo was good too, I have never had such soft bhaturas ever. The taste of cholas was pretty good too.  Chaas along with it was like cherry on a cake. Veg meal presentation was also nice. Quantity is pretty good here, its more than enough for one person, and tastes pretty good. The paneer that they serve here is very soft, just melts in your mouth.

Somedays I feel Burger King is better than McDonald's, though that is something quite debatable and contraversial tooüòÅ"
2,"The Lake city mall where this outlets is situated is completely a dead property. The mall looks like a very dingy place. Burger King outlet has an entry from exterior so you donot need to enter the mall.
I ordered cheese Crispy veg burger which was very average in taste. The chocolate milkshake was good. This outlet is a quiet place as it is not too crowded due to low footfalls at the mall."

Menu wise there are lot of options and customizable options are good too. Service is little slow in this outlet, when waiting is huge the staff outrightly says order will take 1 hour plus which is an indirect way of saying we're not going to take your order.

Haven't had complaints food wise here, only service and staff attitude needs some correction. Cheers!"
3,"WOK was tasty. Noodles were soft and the sauces along with all the ingredients in combination were good.

The only drawback is its price with respect to its quantity. I personally feel it wasn't worth the price. Although the taste was good, I think they should increase the quantity as well.

Wanted to try this Unique concept of WOK from a long time and finally got to taste it."
1,"Very rude staff , I went at 10:55 and there was a lady at the counter said we are shut and I asked her. What time do y‚Äôall close? She said 11 PM so I told her it‚Äôs only 10:55. She said it‚Äôs closed. I requested her please. It‚Äôs for a child the order she said we have three more orders to go. I cannot do anything. This is really wrong and very rude. After that. I requested a guy who was at the counter. He said if I take the order so who will cook for you this is not the way to talk to any customer like this."
4,"Noodles- Taste was good overall chilli flakes made it more flavourful but was dry those who love to eat dry would definitely love this
Manchurian were okaish
Momos were really good
And combo was okay too

Packaging was amazing
Delivery was a bit delayed however manageable"
1,"Neither Chinese, nor Indian in taste.....Food is not worth the exorbitant price. Chicken fried rice hardly had any chicken in it, it was excess spicy and salty. Rice not properly cooked. Waste of money. Not recommended to visit at all."
4,"We love their Sarso ka saag and makke di roti .. it comes with pickle, buttermilk and jaggery. It is a perfect meal. This outlet is located inside Viviana Mall. The staff is very supportive and service is fast"
4,"Place is well known, clean place to eat. Hot food and taste is all good. Cost is bit higher side compare to other restaurants."
5,"Yesterday visited at Bhagat tarachand at vivyana mallüìç
And tried their
Pani puri
Panner Tikka Biryani
Aalu paratha
Mix chat platter
All the food items were really damn amazing in taste üòã
Specially mic chat platter were something different and amazing.
The service was also good and quick.
The food was prepared with full hygiene.
This is my favorite place for having Indian food and chat üòÑ

I would like to rate this place 10/10üåü

5,"Tara bhagatchand at Viviana Mall is good place for chole bhature, chats.
Sufficient quantity and good food. Just the service time should be worked on. Otherwise good place for snack items."
4,"We came to this place for dinner. Location and taste is good. We ordered bhel puri and dahi batata puri. Both tasted amazing but service was horrible. Both dishes were also spicy so it is a good place to eat from if you can handle the spice level. The server first messed up the dahi batata puri and we had to ask him to correct it. He then also messed up the bhel puri and we had to ask him to correct it again. Would have given 3 stars but since taste was great, had to give 4 stars."
5,"Every food item was superb and it was nice and quiet so we could enjoy our meals and there were absolutely no flaws. Another thing we loved was the chicken tikka masala and the lamb rogan josh and the various Indian breads and not to mention how amazing starters tasted. The service was very nice Anant looked after our table and he was prompt, courteous and left us in our space with family time. The  ambience noise was quiet and the ambience was spot on. As a chef, I really enjoyed this experience and would love to come back many times if I could in future. Thank you for serving us and hope to see you again chef Manmohan, Chef Viklab and chef Dogra. Keep up the good job."
4,"Visited this branch of Copper chimney chain at Viviana mall thane West on 9th December 2024. The ambience is very very beautiful with the place being properly lit up and decorated with artefacts. The seating is also spacious. Coming to food we had ordered a Paneer starter and a tikki starter. Dal fry steam rice a mocktail and fresh lime soda. And at last the signature Kulfi falooda. All of the food was fantastic , definitely recommend this place for the food taste and quality. Now coming to the worst part is the service. We waited an hour for our main course to arrive as the staff was busy catering to a huge group who came to celebrate a kids birthday. Our table order was kept on hold till we pressed them to hurry up the order service. Then after the meal we asked for a finger bowl which the service listened but ignored, and didn't even have the courtesy to offer wet towels considering the premium they charge on every dish. Not even the mouth freshener was served after the meal at the time of bill payment. We asked the team to cancel the service charge of 10% charged in bill due to such poor service. Which in other case we would have happily paid. Note here that they have a written statement that if we don't like service we can ask them to remove the service charge which we did. Recommend this place for the food quality and taste but not got the service offered. Management if you happen to read this review kindly take a note and level up in the service department."
3,"Being a delhite in Mumbai, I often ask people where I can get good north indian food around here and one name pops up more often than others- Copper Chimney.

I recently visited the Thane branch in Viviana Mall. The place had a very calm and peaceful atmosphere despite being in such a crowded mall, the vibe in here seemed perfect for a family dine in.

The staff- waiters, servers all the way up to the manager were all very polite and showed positive signs of warm hospitality. They make the dine in experience more royal with their service.

We ordered 3 starters, 3 breads, 3 sabzi/dals and a lot of onion. The first starter was tandoori chaap tikka which was really soft,dense and delicious. Mixed with the mint chutney, it was flavourful. From there , I somehow felt that the quality kept on decreasing. The other 2 starters were kind of average, not up to the mark.

Then we had the main course. We ordered paneer khurchan but it wasn't spicy despite being mentioned in the menu. Secondly the dal wasn't flavourful enough.

In conclusion I would say that although the dining experience here would be nice , I wouldn't justify paying such exorbitant amounts of money for food that didn't taste that well. Won't suggest to someone who wants to have some good north indian."
5,"We had wonderful dinner time at Copper Chimney Viviana Mall .
Ambience is nice üëå
We got good food & service .
Ram proactively helped us with us with Menu & delivery .
We ordered Anarkali mocktail which was refreshing & Delhi chaat was also Yummy
Panner Kadhai & naam was also good"
4,"Very nice place to take lunch, dinner. Food is good. Open kitchen available. Good attention towards customer"
5,"Mainland China at Viviana Mall in Thane-West is a delightful fusion of luxurious Thai-Chinese ambiance and comfortable seating. The staff's guidance in suggesting dishes adds to the experience, especially if you opt for the unlimited buffet.

The starters, served tableside, showcase authentic Chinese dim sums that tantalize the taste buds with its yumminess. The Lung Fung soup, though slightly watery, surprises with its flavorful egg white fry. The diced chicken with assorted pepper might lack the pronounced assorted pepper flavour but compensates with its overall deliciousness and yumminess.

Moving to the mains, the Tsing Hoi chicken and Mandarin fish in gravy complement steamed rice exceptionally, creating a mouthwatering ensemble. As for desserts, the honey noodles combined with vanilla ice cream provide a heavenly blend of crispness and sweetness, while the chocolate rolls may sometimes be overwhelming with their chocolate chunks.

The continuous and consistent serving on the my table was something that we lacked and made a bit of disappointment as we had to wait for the food to arrive .
Priced reasonably at 745 for a 10-course lunch, the experience is exceptional, especially for non-vegetarians indulging in sumptuous dim sums and flavorful chicken starters. While I didn't explore the vegetarian selection, the variety offered assures a balanced culinary adventure. Overall, a fabulous dining journey with a mix of standout dishes and a comfortable sitting.

4,"Mainland China has a quick service, I must say. The ambience is okay. Bit on expensive side.
We ordered, Basil Flavoured Chicken Dumplings which were really good. Ginger Chili Chicken and Wok Tossed Chicken Hakka Noodles were really delicious. Hakka Noodles were very soft. Chicken in Roasted Garlic Sauce is something better to be avoided.
We also tried Iced Tea and some Mango Peach cocktail. Mango Peach cocktail was kind of sweet however I personally liked it."
4,"Nice ambience. Order placed comes out in fair amount of time. Food quality, taste & quantity is good.
They have varieties of cocktails & mocktails to choose from.

Service is little above average. Some time you could see your waiter serving multiple tables.

Good place for families & couples."
5,"Every authentic chinese lover must visit this place. The ambience of this place is really good & the seatings are spacious, the service is good as well.

We tried lung fung soup in both veg & non veg, i personally did like the veg one as it had tofu in it & had the perfect flavours.

Must try the dimsums here, we ordered both veg & non veg dimsums, the chicken dimsums with their inhouse sauce tastes amazing.

They serve many kinds of dishes in main course all authentic. Must try the mandarin fish in main course. Its all worth trying.

*Overall experience:-
Service-5/5
Food-5/5
Ambience-5/5"
4,"They have buffet but we went with Alacart and totally loved the food.  We ordered eight treasure vegetable soup and was great full of veggies. For starters we ordered crispy cottage cheese with smoked chillies and that was the show stopper.  We loved it completely even more that the main course.  Do try it guys,  you will love it. For main course we went with authentic pan fried noodles with garlic sauce. Our all experience was amazing."
2,"Popcorn chicken was good.

But staff seems to be lazy, if you are paying through upi/card they simply say to order it from ordering machine.

Staff need to be more polite and helpful."
3,"Tried the Epic Savings Bucket. While everything tasted good, the Hot and Crispy Chicken was overly oily, which was disappointing. On the bright side, the staff was courteous, and the service was quick."
1,Had food today (order No 976 ) food was cold as usual and pieces were the smallest broken is was even after reminding to give fresh. Not happening for the first time though but after Covid the quality has deteriorated very very much. Ordered just because of my son but complete waste of money.
5,"I recently visited the KFC outlet in Viviana Mall, and overall, it was a satisfying experience. Located conveniently on the second floor of the mall, this KFC branch is easily accessible and hard to miss. The ambiance is typical of KFC‚Äîbright, lively, and welcoming, which sets the tone for a pleasant dining experience.

One of the first things that stood out was the efficiency of the staff. Despite the usual hustle and bustle, the queue moved quickly, and I didn‚Äôt have to wait long to place my order. The staff were polite and attentive, ensuring that every customer was attended to promptly.

The food quality was up to the mark, as expected from KFC. The chicken was crispy, juicy, and flavorful, maintaining the brand‚Äôs signature taste. I tried the Zinger Burger and a bucket of Hot & Crispy Chicken, both of which were delicious and fresh. The fries were perfectly cooked, and the coleslaw was creamy and refreshing.

However, there are a few areas that could use improvement. The seating area, though clean, felt a bit cramped, especially during peak hours. Finding a spot to sit can be challenging. Additionally, while the service was generally quick, there were slight delays in receiving some items from the order, which could be improved for a more seamless experience.

Overall, the KFC at Viviana Mall is a great spot for a quick, tasty meal. It lives up to the expectations with its delicious food and friendly service, making it a reliable choice for KFC fans. I would definitely recommend this outlet for anyone craving some good fried chicken while shopping at the mall."
5,"Located inside Viviana mall, not very crowded, ambience is nice, ordered food through the machines outside."
5,"Good authentic pizza spot if anyone wish to have something different than regular pizza brands.... Do give it a shot ‚ù§Ô∏èüåπ

Giardeinera - signature pizza
Chicken tikka - napel pizza
Garlic bread with mozerrella
Penne arrabiata pasta
Vanilla  Cheesecake

Only felt disappointed with the pasta üôÉüôÑüòì
Please don't try it.

Otherwise vibe, ambience all is good.

Service is good."
3,"Atmosphere was good, but the food which we wanted to order were all out of stock. They answered that since vegetarian cuisine is ordered less so they keep limited amount of it, they did that to almost 3-4 of our items which we were going to order even Garlic Bread. The other food items which we ordered tasted good but by then there wasn't much expectation from them and we had to hurry to other place as well. So didn't enjoy the food or place this time, maybe next time they will serve us well."
5,"Had a great time and a lovely pizza.
Highly recommend Padana here with extra cheese toppings. Just amazing.

Service by Mr. Shiv was warm and welcoming. It's always a delight to dine at Pizza Express!"
5,"I have never been to this place but my husband has many times in the past. I really enjoyed the variety of menu options available. I tried the dough balls for the first time, and they were absolutely delicious! The bruschetta originale was also a highlight. A special shoutout to our waitress, Afreen, who was incredibly kind, polite, and attentive throughout our meal. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great food beyond just pizza.‚Äù"
5,Talking about the ambience..it is top notch. Service is slow. Staff behaviour is good and polite. The variety of pizza they offer is mind-blowing. I have never come across such a varied category of pizza.
4,"We had gone for a casual family lunch. We had a good time enjoying the continental cuisine. We ordered Carnivore Grilled Platter and Whacko Pizza Tacos for starters. Taste was good. For main course we tried Carribean Party Pizza and Summer Garden Pizza. Both looked quite fancy, taste was okay as well. Ambience was fine if you like music. Seating arrangement was cosy. Overall a good experience."
3,"The ambience of this place is good. We visited on a sunday evening. There's ample space inside for even a big group of people to visit for a party. We had a starter, main course, and cocktail. The rating decreased only because of the washroom. In a club, the washroom is most important. The mens washroom was worse than a public toilet. Attached are the pictures."
4,"The Irish House offers a lively ambiance with wooden interiors and tasty comfort food like Fish & Chips, Irish Potato Skins, and juicy burgers. The extensive beer and cocktail menu makes it a perfect spot to relax and enjoy with friends!

I tried
Lean bean burger
White sauce penne
Margarita pizza
Purple viking mocktail (10/10) highly recommended"
5,Food excellent taste and variety of dishes.. Best Menu card with images of every dish.. Drinks availability limited but good offers..  Place seemed short staffed on a busy Sunday afternoon.. service is too slow.. ambience like a dark place sports bar style.. overall very nice experience.. will love to visit again.. MUST TRY Headless Chicken Platter and Chicken Pizzas.
5,Place is must visit. Food is too good. Nikhil Mhatre was our server. He was very polite and good at his job.
1,"This MOD in korum mall was disappointing the staff was inattentive, donuts weren‚Äôt fresh, and the tables weren‚Äôt clean. The overall experience was below average. Definitely wouldn‚Äôt visit again."
4,"A good place for desserts, doughnuts, and fancy soft drinks. This is a franchise-based shop, so the services and products are the same as in all other MOD shops. The taste is good and chocolaty, and you also have options for fancy coolers."
5,"This is one of the best MOD outlets we've visited. There's a good seating area and there are some great new donut varieties too.

We ditched our regular choices and ordered the Hazelnut Bliss Eclair and Not so aam (mango lovers!) Both were quite good.

I love how beautifully they glaze and decorate every item making it both look and taste amazing. Their cute bite-sized options are a great gifting option too."
5,"Yesterday there was amazing offer for women's day.. love this offer and mostly the service of the staff they were so quick and fast and so good handling by the Store manager and his team.. The Store manager was so well trained and experienced to deal with the customer in queue he was so well deserving candidates to handle the crowd.my mother loves the donuts as it was a good food. First time I am reviewing the Store
.well done MOD.. expand your love to people like this only.."
4,"If you really mad about donuts, do visit this place.

They have variety of donuts. Bite size donuts are available. Small beauties are an instant hit amongst kids. They have kept beverages too.

They have offers like pay for 5 get 6 or pay for 9 and get 12 etc.

Place is clean and hygiene is maintained."
4,"An amazing experience to have. With more than 10 katories in your plate and a thali full of delicacies to satisfy your palate , one should definitely visit their place . I loved their hospitality with quick services and prompt responses. Would love to visit again"
5,"Ordered the Rajdhani Elite Meal Box and it was a delightful experience! The packaging was neat and everything was fresh and intact. The box came with soft steamed rice, two tasty farsan items, flavorful dal, three well-cooked sabzis, six soft phulkas, a yummy dessert, and all the necessary accompaniments. It really felt like a complete, satisfying meal ‚Äî just like a mini thali at home. Great for days when you‚Äôre craving a comforting, balanced vegetarian meal. Will definitely order again!"
5,"A lovely experience at Rajdhani Restaurant!üòçüòçüòç
It was my first time eating at Rajdhani, and it was also my first time trying thali. I don't know names of many dishes , but everything was delicious, and vegetarian.
Jalebi , dal bati churma, gajar halwa , aloo sabji , and paneer sabji are so delicious and worth for money. Lassi is also  awesome üëå üëå.
It's definitely a worthy try with your family and loved ones. You will feel home
The place is fanctastic. The ambiance is very classy"
5,"Well a perfect place for Rajasthani/Gujarati Food. Food is unlimited and no restriction as such on any food item.

Always call before visiting here and make note of menu items as per your choice as it is different every day.
Also do check Zomato Dining offers, you can save a few bucks by applying discounts if it's available."
1,"Don't order from them on Zomato‚Äîthey will trick you with other options. This is what I received for my ‚Çπ444 dinner: samosa and dhokla instead of bhindi, rice, chapati n dal. Seriously? Wow."
3,Good for outing with friends. Though they have a valentines menu.. The ambience isn't much suited for dates. Food is decent and they have a lot of variety in cuisines.
5,"We stopped by for a quick drink and some bites, and it was a delightful experience! The grilled pepper chicken was perfectly seasoned and packed with flavor, while the fish fingers were crispy, fresh, and absolutely delicious ‚Äì both are a must-try. A special shoutout to the captain, who was incredibly courteous and ensured everything was just right. It's these little touches that make such visits memorable. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for great food and excellent service!"
3,"Visited this outlet at Viviana mall on 7th December 2024 at lunchtime. The place serves Italian and Chinese continental food. We had ordered cheese Garlic bread and Veg shezwan rice along with fresh lime soda and a mocktail. The reason for 3 stars in food category is the garlic bread which was not upto the mark, as I have tasted many a times at different places. But this was not good, had fishy smell coming from it. The shezwan rice was good though. The mocktail served was also good. The service is ok. The atmosphere here is lively but the music is a bit loud to the normal ear. Could improve in the above aspects.
Okish experience can be improved quite a bit by the restaurant."
4,"Good place for drinking and snacks in Viviana mall. They have happy hours from 4.30pm to 8.30pm where you get 1+1 offer on pitcher. Quick bites are good. Crispy corn was amazing, though we were disappointed with Nasi goreng fried rice where they served regular schezwan fried rice with peanuts.
Otherwise, food was tasty, service was good and staff was nice."
4,"It's a cool place to hangout with colleagues and friends, best for big groups although not quite suitable for date, similar to pop tates"
2,"Ugh! The service is the worst here, the employees though... Here's my experience,
I got something else in my orderüíÄ‚ò†Ô∏è for which i hadnt asked them in first place and when I told them about this they didnt care too accept their fault, hahha lol,
Rest everything is good, ambience music is too loud, and management is weak,

If u visit this place you will find cups lieing down and boxes left on tables, the food tastes good üòã"
2,"I tried Domino's new Cheese Volcano Pizza and it was not up to the mark. We ordered online and it arrived cold, with the cheese becoming hard. Considering the price, it was disappointing. Additionally, the order took more than an hour to be delivered. Domino's pizzas used to taste good, but the quality has degraded."
1,"I recently ordered from this Domino‚Äôs franchise, and unfortunately, it was a highly disappointing experience. When the delivery arrived, I noticed that the seasoning and chilli flakes were missing. The delivery guy assured me he would bring them soon, but after waiting for quite some time, I called him, only to be told that he had already left and since it was out of stock, the restaurant only did not provided.

This was incredibly frustrating, as I had to wait with no updates, and no one from the store reached out to resolve the issue. As if that wasn't bad enough, the delivered pizza was in poor condition‚Äîstuck to the top of the box.

I‚Äôve also raised my concerns with customer support, but I didn‚Äôt receive any response or resolution. It‚Äôs disappointing to see such a lack of customer care and attention to what they are known for."
1,Where the hell is the cheese? pathetic service. And it has happened multiple times now. Either they don't know how to make a pizza or they think we're idiots. Pls just do me a favor and shut your outlet!
4,"We got stuffed Paratha Pizza free bcoz of some ongoing offer period. What's not to love!? Otherwise PARATHA PIZZA is not worth buying but when free, We appreciate everything, lol.

Another offer was Garlic bread & Margherita regular at Rs. 198. GARLIC BREAD actually is not that good, it had low to no flavour of Garlic & after a while it feels you're only munching on Bread. Homemade Garlic bread is much better & Flavourful ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è MARGHERITA is similar. Rather, go for Cheesy from Pizza Mania. It's an absolute favourite üßÄü§§

ACHARI was ok ok. When we Indians can have Achar so easily, why will we prefer it as a flavour in our Pizza? ü§î PASTA pizza was having half-cooked pieces of Pasta. Flavour wise average."
5,"We had a wonderful dining experience at China Bistro! The ambiance was warm and welcoming, and the food was absolutely delicious. A special mention to Mr. Tushar, who went above and beyond to make our visit enjoyable. He was extremely courteous and helpful, recommending some amazing dishes that we thoroughly enjoyed. His suggestions really enhanced our overall experience. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking to enjoy great food with excellent service!"
1,"Service was very bad and late.
No customer service and the restaurant manager was
un-cooperative and not willing to understand.
I would not recommend the place.
There was no regular refill of buffet items,.
Many items on buffet were repeated several time during the week.
Desserts variety and quality is bad.
They were only worried about presenting the bill.
They just wanted to clear the table for the next customer.

Update on 26th May- Email also sent."
5,"I had an amazing dining experience at this authentic Chinese restaurant! The dim sum was absolutely fantastic‚Äîfresh, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. We also tried the sushi, which was surprisingly fresh and delicious for a Chinese restaurant! Every dish we ordered exceeded our expectations. The staff were incredibly friendly, and our server, Prafulla, provided excellent service throughout the meal. He was attentive, knowledgeable, and really made us feel welcome. Highly recommend this spot for anyone craving delicious Authentic Chinese food, Dim sum, and Sushi and practically anything.
I‚Äôll definitely be back!"
5,"Had an amazing experience at this restaurant! The atmosphere was perfect‚Äîcalm, elegant, and truly immersive. The sushi was incredibly fresh and delicious, easily some of the best I‚Äôve had. A special shoutout to our waiter, Subhranshu, who provided excellent service‚Äîattentive, friendly, and very knowledgeable. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a top-tier dining experience!"
5,"Very tasty food. Good presentation. The tempura roll was the best that I‚Äôve ever had. Kimchi fried rice was something new that we tried and it was amazing!
China Bistro is going to be my regular weekend dinner places!"
5,"I recently visited this charming Indian pizzeria, and it was an incredible experience. I tried the Veggie Delight pizza, and it was absolutely delicious! The flavors were fresh and unique, perfectly blending Indian spices with classic pizza ingredients. Along with that, I had the Tiramisu for dessert, and it was simply outstanding ‚Äî rich, creamy, and the perfect sweet finish to a great meal.

The ambiance of the place was lovely, with a warm, inviting atmosphere that made the dining experience even more enjoyable. What stood out the most was the staff; they were so friendly and joyful, making us feel welcome the entire time.

Overall, it was a fantastic experience, and I highly recommend this spot for anyone looking to enjoy a unique twist on pizza with excellent service."
4,"Overall, a great experience! The pizza is delicious with a perfectly crispy crust and fresh, flavorful toppings. The variety of options is impressive, and there‚Äôs something for everyone. Even the pasta is also amazing..The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. The only reason I‚Äôm not giving 5 stars is because the service could have been a bit quicker, but it didn‚Äôt take away from the overall experience. Definitely recommend for anyone craving a tasty pizza!"
5,"Amazing experience to dine here.
It is truly mind-blowing.
The good here is traditionally made and super tasty.
Made my birthday memorable.
The prices might look like a lot,
But trust me, the food is worth the price."
4,"The pizza was really good, and the Nutella dough balls were absolutely delicious. We also tried the sticks, which were pretty nice. Overall, the food was great, and the prices were reasonable too. Everything we ordered was enjoyable, and we had a good experience. The only thing that didn‚Äôt stand out was the mojito‚Äîit was just okay. But apart from the drinks, the food was definitely worth it!"
5,"It was an amazing experience at this place. Food is good. Specially the star pizza. Yogesh and the entire staff were very welcoming and as it was my family members birthday, the staff made it special with complimentary desert and also celebrated birthday by singing the HBD song. Though they had multiple orders but the staff went that extra mile to make it special."
1,Very poor quality.Literally threw away the boxes as it is.First time had a bad experience with Sweet Bengal outlet.
2,"I used to always order from the Sweet Bengal outlet at Viviana Mall. However recently the Viviana Mall outlet had run out of stock, so I ordered from this outlet.

Items ordered:
Cream Chamcham [2 Pcs] x 2
Milk Cake x 2
Rose Malai Chamcham [1 Piece] x 1

Both chamcham were a disappointment. Totally unlike the tasty, mouth watering variety being served by the Viviana Mall outlet. Being the same brand, I am not sure why there should be such a difference in the taste and potion size too.

Milk cake was like a tiny piece of sweet, though somewhat tasty.

In future I'll stick to the Viviana Mall outlet only."
1,If you want to book an appointment in Hospital then this is the best place for you to go...they serve Samosas whose smell can upset your stomach. Food department should make an inspection into their outlet
5,"Great sweet shop
Authentic Bengali sweets which taste like the ones in West Bengal
Good location (present on Gladys Alwares Road)
Nice variety of sweets including Cream Chom Chom, Rosogolla, Sondesh, Kanchagolla, Mishti Doi, Gulab Jamun, Langcha etc
Make sure to try their Nolen Gur sweets which are made out of new jaggery
A little bit on the expensive side but worth it for Bengali sweet lovers, or sweet lovers in general
Note: Preferably consume the sweets within a day or two (12 hours ideally) of buying so as to maintain the freshness"
1,Sweet Bengal is no longer located at the address shown on maps. It‚Äôs shut shop

4,Food is very tasty and have variety in thali. We tried Bombil and Surmai Thali. Bhaakri should have been more softer. Rates are also very reasonable. Only taste and no bakwaas concept. Good place to visit.
5,"Five stars for the great non veg food, efficient staff and great pricing. The fried fish is excellent. It is served quickly, fresh and cooked to perfection without any excess oil. Neat and clean place, bright and no fuss. Every dish was delicious. Waiters are polite and helpful. The veg thali is a perfect option for vegetarians. The sol kadi and fish curry are lovely. Please do not expect a fancy place with a posh atmosphere - this is a simple place serving great non veg food. Best place in Thane for delicious, finger licking seafood, chicken & Mutton. Good ambience, no comparison. Rarely you come across a place that have stood it's test of time and remained authentic... This is one of them... No fuss  and yet amazing. There is no air-conditioning in the place and you may not even feel the need of it. The food takes away all other shot comings... Absolutely brilliant"
4,"Limited seating, small food joint with almost no parking space but neat and clean. Had option of AC / Non AC Dining. Ambience is not like a cafe. Good part is food was tasty and had malvani, punjabi, tandoori, chinese dishes on menu and not too costly. Surmai thali costed ~320...and has 2 variants i.e king size and jumbo.
Oil used in frying fish was fresh as there was no foul smell which I encountered at many other places. The curry in thali had spicy sour taste and was balanced. Green chutney, rice bhakri, fried fish was all good. Sol kadhi would be rated 3.5/5. Size of surmail fish in thali and pomfret was beyond expectation at this rate. Chicken lollypop is offered in fried as well as tandoori options. Tandoori ones were well prepared. Chiken sukka had a tasty masala but had less chilli possibly because we were accompanied with a kid."
5,"Harish Lunch Home is a must-visit for seafood lovers. The menu features a range of fresh, flavorful dishes, from tender fish curries to perfectly spiced prawns.

1,Food was tasty but the way the provide service to customer is really disgusting. Looting customer. Giving wrong amount in the bill and even charging extra money if you not checked the bill properly. I am daily visited there but the way they started treating customer in last one month is very pathetic
1,"Worst cake shop, bought rainbow pastry, donut dessert & muffin. All of them tasted worst. The muffin did not feel fresh and of very low quality. The cream of muffin was so bad & lowest quality. The bread of donut was very hard. Not at all recommend. Please maintain Monginis standard atleast. Our anniversary evening was spoiled due to the bad quality deserts."
1,"Stale cakes , middle class brand. visit this place , if you want cheap cakes. They don't sell fresh cakes and if you complain , they just simply give you stupid reasons."
1,"The lady owner is just too arrogant. I ordered rainbow cake from Zomato. But the cake was totally different. I paid for candles as well, but didn't got it. When I contacted the owner regarding candles, she denied. Trust me, cake was just fine, however full of cream only, and not the cake I wanted. I had to order it from other shop.
Attaching the picture for reference.
1. Rainbow cake from monginis (In which papa is written- don't get confused). DOES IT EVEN LOOK LIKE A RAINBOW CAKE ? üòÇ
2. Rainbow cake from hangout cake- far far better than monginis.
MONGINIS cake shop will just make you fool! Kindly don't waste your money."
5,"This monginis outlet is very close to my house so I buy cakes from here often. Cakes here are freshly baked and quite tasty.

I bought a black forest cake having a neapolitan wafer on it on which they write name of a person. That cake was similar to the black forest cake you can see in the picture. The only difference was the presence of a neapolitan wafer on it.
The pineapple cake you can see in the picture was also good. You can give it a try."
4,We ordered Photo printed cake with Mango Flavour... It was decent... A photo was provided by us... Cake Delivery was on time... Enjoy üòä
4,"Good place to have dinner with friends or family.

The restaurant has a good ambience.
Liquor is costly. Food is good.

They also have buffet on Fridays.

Overall Rating : 4.5/5"
5,Celebrated my mother‚Äôs 80th birthday with close family and friends. It was an amazing day and we had a wonderful family time together. The food the service was top class which just added to the already great experience. Special mention to our care taker Mr. Kapil Dev who ensured we and our guests were taken care of. If the management takes note of this review please share this attached photo. Regards Uday
5,Always an amazing place to eat! The chef de cuisine Mr Lobo is always cooking delicious treats! Mr Vijay and his team always provide top level hospitality. Come with your friends and family and enjoy a beautiful meal and a great time!
5,"A wonderful restaurant that dishes out scrumptious food with unabated consistency. Everything from taste, range, quality, pricing and ambience are perfect. The restaurant serves Indian, Chinese and continental varieties whilst preserving individual flavors well. It exudes a vibrant vibe and the staff here is extremely courteous. The service is great."
5,"Absolutely fantastic service by the staff.
The food was excellent. Special mention for custom making vegan food for a few friends. That was really amazing service.
Overall an amazing place.
Would highly recommend"
5,"Got our dinner packed from here today. To try out, took three different vegetables, thepla and a chawal bhakri. The food was a bit high on oil as per our own standards but would ignore that since most would like it that way. It was not too spicy so would suit many like us. Price is truly unbelievable. We will certainly be back soon. Best wishes!"
5,"A menu that showcases culinary perfection, each dish has it's own uniqueness. Impeccable service. Once you eat from here, you'll end up craving for more."
1,Reasonably priced veg food. They only do take- away and no seating is there. Very good choice if you want small quantities of veg dishes at a very reasonable price. The dishes here are offered in terms of grams/weight.
5,They have a great assortment of cooked vegetables and are really underpriced. The taste is like home made food. The location is great and I've seen it being frequented by people working for top companies and have no time to cook food for themselves. The staff is friendly too.
2,Food is overpriced. 40 Rs for mere 100 gm that too in which 50 gm is gravy. Food taste is okayish not too good not bad.
5,This place does not have any seating arrangements. Only takeaway. Plus the google location is flawed. After reaching the google location better to ask someone where it actually is
5,Nice place..clean and hygenic
5,Mamledar is Thane's tagline.. best in taste
4,The best you can get in Thane railway station area. Very spicy and smoky
1,This is not mamledar anymore. This some other place now. The misal is terrible.
2,"Average Restaurant.

Visited this restaurant on the weekend, the place wasn't crowded and the tables were available.

The ambience is okayish not great. The service is quick and the serving people are very attentive.

The food though is very average.

We had ordered

1) Jamaican jerk chicken
2) Naachos
3) Pizza
4) Chicken tikka sizzler.

Out of all the things ordered , the pizza was good and rest all were below average in taste. The quantity was good for two but the taste didn't meet the expectation.

Won't be visiting this place in near future."
4,"Been to Pop Tates after years with my wife as we had been for shopping in Korum mall and we had over here for dinner‚Ä¶. Overall ambience is the same and Vibe is cool‚Ä¶.
It‚Äôs a good place for bachelors and couples‚Ä¶
Food is just ok as they don‚Äôt have much option and taste is also not that good as per compared to others‚Ä¶.
Service is very fast and quantity is good‚Ä¶.
They do have indoor and outdoor seating so you can enjoy music with your loved once here and can have a drink‚Ä¶.
Just suggestion need to maintain Hygiene and Cleanliness‚Ä¶
Overall good üëçüèª"
5,"I recently went to PopTates at Korum Mall after 12 years, and it was such a great experience! The food was absolutely delicious, and the service was impressive. We ordered a variety of dishes, including Grilled Paneer Tikka, Broccoli & Cheese Bites, Oriental Veggie Sizzler, Cajun Grilled Chicken Sizzler, Paneer Sizzler, and finished off with a Lotus Biscoff Pastry for dessert. Every dish was full of flavor, served in generous portions, and cooked to perfection.

What stood out was how quickly everything was served, without compromising on quality. The staff was friendly and attentive, which made the experience even better. The place had a warm and inviting vibe, which made it perfect for a relaxed meal.

Honestly, the food was so good that I‚Äôve already started visiting regularly. If you‚Äôre in or around Korum Mall and looking for tasty food with great service, I‚Äôd highly recommend PopTates. I‚Äôm definitely going back soon‚Äîit‚Äôs a place that‚Äôs worth revisiting!"

I would recommend everyone to reach in Happy Hours as they've huge offers in this time.... üçªüç∫ü•Éüç±ü•ò"
4,"Reliving diploma days at Pop Tates, Korum Mall! The place still holds its charm.
We indulged in a hearty meal of onion rings, fries, peri peri fries, chicken lollipops, pasta, pizza, and some other chicken starters.
The food was delicious as always, and the music created a great ambiance. Unfortunately, the service was a bit slow.
Overall, a nostalgic and enjoyable experience!"
5,"If you love trying different beers, this is the place to be! With an impressive selection of craft beers from IPAs to stouts and everything in between, there‚Äôs something for everyone. The ambiance is chill, with friendly staff ready to recommend the best brews. Perfect spot for beer enthusiasts!"
5,"""Had a fantastic time at Beer Caf√©. The food was average, the drinks were perfectly chilled, mocktails were not up to the mark and the atmosphere was just right for a fun night out with friends. The staff (Karan Pandit) was friendly and attentive, making the experience even better. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a great place to unwind and enjoy good company!"
1,"Thanks for informing me that you don't have a service charge and later on adding the same. What I hated the most was when I saw another bill where someone was not charged this service charge who didn't redeem any points or had a zomato offer. So, in short, if you have a zomato table booking or if you have their brew miles, they will charge you these extra service charge. Which is, according to the government is voluntary and not mandatory."
4,Beer cafe is a good place to have a drink with your peers and friends.. the have almost every beer you will think of getting in India available here‚Ä¶ ambiance is too good ‚Ä¶ but food was average maybe I ordered the wrong thing ‚Ä¶ maybe next time i will try something different
1,"We had the worst experience with the Beer cafe at Korum Mall.. First we ordered chicken lollypop.. after an hour the waiter mentioned that the menu is not available... Then he mentioned they had chicken chilly which only had bones.. In veg we tasted worst tikka platter ever.. Paneer tikka is not at all cooked.. all other tikka items were tasteless... Please work out on your menu or change your chef..
Nachos also not at all good.."
1,Really disappointed. I had invited guests and my cylinder stopped working and everyone was very hungry so we chose to order pizza and In one pizza the toppings were totally washed out as you can see in the image shared and the other pizza was undercooked and tasted really bad like it's stale. It was so embarrassing for me and I am really very much disappointed. Terrible Dominos.
1,"We ordered veg extra vaganza , such a bad experience for the 2nd time in a row, order was delivered within 10 mins right after ordering, it seems as if they had an pizza ready with them even before we ordered and they just added the veg extravaganza toppings to it baked it again and delivered to us, because toppings we didn't wanted or selected like black olives, paneer, black bean was also added.
Also we ordered non veg parcel even it was kept ready before we ordered and they just reheated it  and gave it to us...
Very disappointing product and service by Domino's.Hope they will reply us as we are trusting this brand and ordering hope they have courtesy to address our issue by contacting back to us .
Total waste of money.

5,Very Neat n clean n hygiene maintained place. Your order is served before ETA. The staff is very good n calm n supportive. Overall a great experience with take away orders.
1,forcing me to pay online as i am already carring cash with me then too very rude staff as if they don't care about customer service staff is rude here
1,The food came extremely late plus no oregano and chilli flakes were provided.The toppings were less and the quality was not good at all.Very Dissapointed with the services provided by Dominos.
4,"Awesome food. Service is excellent.
Needs tlc, cleaning and upgrades. Too noisy."
5,One of our best bar just because of rhe quality of food and the service of waiter Uttam
5,"My experience with Sadanand has always being amazing. The food is superb, had ordered for my house party both veg and non veg options were very tasty the portion served was good enough for all guest. Each and every guest asked us from where the snacks were organised. It was just amazing. We enjoyed every bite of it. Highly recommend the food hygiene, quality, quantity and taste. Keep it up."
4,Nice place for a drink and non veg food
5,Veg kanali my favourite dish
5,"This offers good food and ambience. We ordered chef special sandwich paneer tikka masala, Imperial Dal makhni, garlic naan and butter roti. The taste of food is good. Ambience is more like a lounge. I personally liked it. Staff is courteous"

Butter chicken was also excellent.
Highly recommend place for food.
Keep up the good work and cooking.very very few place I do recommend and review since I a BIG foodie.only the best of food I do recommend and post review not every place or restaurant I eat it."
4,"Good place for having food. Prices for main course are quite reasonable. However, prices of Indian bread are slightly on a higher side. They serve alcohol as well. They accept Credit/Debit cards. The restaurant is visible and it is on the main road. Overall I think it was a good experience and probably I may go back."
1,"Mosquitoes in drinks and food is the USP.

Poorly maintained place with poor hygiene ensures Not to visit again. To top the sad experience, management doesn't bothers to assist or consider either."
4,"Rasna punjab is near to my house but i havent visited here. In rasna punjab you can get a chicken food,chinese food etc as much i know. If you want to visit there you can visit and share your review with us. It is ok restaurent even there is having many restaurents in chembur which is much better but i suggest try every thing before any conclusion"
1,"Please think before visiting
Bad food and service
Lot of time taken to serve the food
Price is high and quantity is low
Not properly cooked, and very hard chicken
Took more than 30mins to serve between 2 dishes"

4,"Recommended Butter chicken, they give great quantity and quality food, Ambience is dim, dark and kind of shady, A 3 star for price 4 star for food 2 star for ambience and 4 star for service. The service is fast. Staff is polite and helping. They also provide home delivery free of cost over 200 order. Overall it is good choice if you are too lazy on weekends and want to enjoy food and drink at your place."
3,"It's a dull atmosphere through out.  The moment I reach there I was somewhere in a no zone on area.  This is the first of its kind of place which got renovated and its worse then before.
First of all the AC was not working secondly then ever to Kenny effort to work on it inspired of telling multiple times by multiple customers.
Third in the most important thing was the billing part wearing their charge me for AC later on the deducted just 50 rupees as if their doing a favour on me.  Upon discussing with the manager there for the reduced my amount but that was also not the satisfactory.
Talking about the food the food was good I took away at 4 from my home and it was as good as it was in the bar."
3,"Spacious interiors as compared to other places in the same price range. The service is good, but the food is strictly average. The lighting in the air-conditioned section is a bit too colourful though. Could definitely do with fewer blinking lights. Also, the malai kofta was a lot sweeter than it should be, so not that great in the food department."
3,Food is good.Preferred only for guys and especially who drink. No families please. Seating and ambience is not upto the mark. Crowd also is sad but the food is awesome ..thats y 3 stars !
5,"Good service, friendly staff, nice music & relaxing ambience. Two thumbs up..!"
1,Very poor sarvice  and salf    very poor
3,Nice food
5,
5,Fabulous....
5,"Green tadka is always the best when it comes to serving quality food. Have been here 6 times till now. Have tried most of their dishes. Something ro recommend Ghee Paneer Roast, Bamboo Biryani, Malaysian Noodles, Wasabi Rice & Noodles, Pesto Rice, Veg Haveli (Exotic Veggies) sabzi, Paneer Haveli sabzi, Broccoli Almond Soup, Thai Mushroom Soup, Double Cook Paneer, Tandoori Paneer Chilly Dry, and the list continues.."
5,The food here is quite delicious and the prices for the same are also really reasonable. A good place to go to on a weekday. Weekends get really crazy here and at times the staff can't really handle it that well. But apart from that it's a good place to go to for an impromptu plan or just to spend time without spending too much money
5,Excellent food and ambiance only the sports bar has become more noisy than earlier.
3,"The food is tasty and prices reasonable , but the manager and lobby service is rude and many patrons are loud and impolite."
1,"Dry chicken with excess salt. The paint was peeling above our table. The service was nice, but the food was horrible. Way too many things on the menu. Different names for the same damn thing. Advice for the management : trim down your menu and focus on making a few really good dishes."
4,Chicken Lasoni was superbly made. Thai curry was too creamy Stuffed masala was too dry in Ruzaly Kabab. Mig Rice were like regular fried rice only and chilli prawns were good in taste but not in price. The tables were too congested felt a bit too tight inside although it wasn‚Äôt a weekend. All together one can enjoy tasty food.
3,The food was decent enough. The place looked crumpled. Services are pretty slow. The good part is they haven't let go any of their tenured/ old staff. A big appreciation to the owner there.
1,"""I ordered from [Stars Parade] and was really looking forward to my meal. Unfortunately, the delivery was delayed by 1 HR, which was a bit disappointing. While the food was delicious, the wait time affected the overall experience.

I hope the restaurant can improve its delivery service in the future, as the food itself was great. Looking forward to a better experience next time!"""
5,"This is my Favourite Restaurant in Chembur.

Hands down one of the best Restaurants of Chembur. Quality Food, delicious taste and decent serving. It's an all-rounder!

I have been to this place for more then 50 times!
Trust me you can't go wrong with this one.
Highly Recommended if you are in Chembur!"
5,"One of the best restaurants that I have visited in Chembur. Mouth watering food, great ambience and prompt service! Serves most of the drinks as well. Would recommend to all!"
4,"Singh Saab is undoubtedly one of the best restaurants in Chembur for authentic North Indian cuisine. The quality of food is exceptional, with their Punjabi dishes, particularly the non-vegetarian options like chicken, standing out. What sets this place apart is its unique combination of serving alcohol alongside delicious food. The versatile drinks menu offers a wide range of options, all of which are of excellent quality. If you find yourself in the area, Singh Saab is a must-visit destination for a memorable culinary experience.
The ambience at Singh Saab adds to the overall dining experience, with its warm and inviting atmosphere. The restaurant is beautifully decorated, creating a comfortable and cozy setting for patrons to enjoy their meals. The staff is friendly and attentive, providing excellent service throughout the visit. Whether you're looking for a romantic dinner or a gathering with friends, Singh Saab offers a delightful dining experience with its delectable North Indian cuisine, impressive drinks selection, and inviting ambiance."
5,"Singh saab
This is Chembur, if you are a lover of North Indian food and Asian, you must visit this place.  The best part is the special food names and presentations!  He always has a smile on his face.  That place is really nice.  The food tastes great and there are many drinks that are great.  The presentation is completely out of mind.  The restaurant has a lot of antique ingredients that make it more enjoyable.  The atmosphere is white eyes when the atmosphere is considered and the theme is in a completely new Bollywood style.
The staff here are very polite and friendly.  They were all taking security and precautions.
My favorite point was that employees always wear masks.  Trust me, you will never regret visiting this place.  There is so much on their list and everything is so unique!  The staff is very polite and the service is very fast.  They were suggesting to us their best foods.  There is a separate DJ system that makes the music more quiet and captivating.  The staff here were quick and good to give us the best service.  The mocktails we tried here were also good.  It was refreshing.  Speaking of the food we tried, their names themselves were so delicious that we had to order every meal.  I've always been a fan of Singh saab

4,"I recently enjoyed dining at Singh Saab, a restaurant known for its diverse Indian and Thai cuisine. Overall, the experience was a mix of highs and lows, resulting in a somewhat satisfying meal.

** Food: 4/5 **
Let's start with the star of the show: the food. Singh Saab certainly knows how to pack a punch in terms of flavour. The Thai Mustard Chilly King Prawns were a standout dish, boasting a delightful combination of tanginess and spice. The Peppercorn & Cheese Stuffed Murg Kebab was another winner, with the perfect balance of heat and creaminess.

However, not every dish hit the mark. The Tawa Murg Ghee Roast Rajasthani left a lot to be desired, lacking the depth of flavor I was expecting. The Butter Chicken and Murg Dum Biryani, while tasty, didn't quite reach the culinary heights I had hoped for. Still, the excellent prawns and kebabs make up for these slight disappointments.

** Service: 3/5 **
The service at Singh Saab was a bit of a mixed bag. While the staff were friendly and accommodating, they seemed a bit overwhelmed at times. It took longer than expected to get our orders, and we had to remind them about a missing dish. This inconsistency in service impacted the overall experience.

** Atmosphere: 3/5 **
The ambiance at Singh Saab was pleasant but didn't leave a lasting impression. The decor was typical of a casual dining restaurant, with a hint of Indian aesthetics. The lighting was warm and inviting, but the noise level was a bit high, making it difficult to have a quiet conversation.

Ordered Items:

1. Thai Mustard Chilly King Prawns [4.5/5]: A delightful burst of flavors with the right balance of spiciness and tang.

2. Peppercorn & Cheese Stuffed Murg Kebab [4.5/5]: A spicy, creamy delight that's worth every bite.

3. Tawa Murg Ghee Roast Rajasthani [2.5/5]: Disappointing, lacked the rich flavors I expected.

4. Butter Chicken [3.5/5]: Good but not exceptional.

5. Murg Dum Biryani [3.5/5]: A decent biryani, but it didn't wow me.

6. Butter Garlic Naan [4/5]: Perfectly cooked and full of flavour.

7. Lacchedar Paratha [3.5/5]: Adequate, but nothing extraordinary.

8. Dark Rum Flavored Flaming Gulab Jamun [4/5]: A unique and delightful dessert with a hint of boozy goodness.

9. Baby Gulab Jamun & Lacha Rabri Martini [4.5/5]: A creative and delicious dessert that I'd highly recommend.

10. Amritsari Malai Lassi [3.5/5]

In summary, Singh Saab is a decent restaurant with some standout dishes, but it falls short in terms of consistency and service. If you're in the mood for some mouthwatering prawns or kebabs, it's worth a visit. However, be prepared for a bit of a wait and don't expect the atmosphere to be a major selling point."
5,The food here is a bit expensive. But the taste is very good. We had ordered burnt garlic chicken and chicken manchow soup home delivery. One of the best starters. Chicken was juicy and fresh.  12 pieces so quantity is also good. Manchow soup both quality and quantity is too good. Sufficient for two people. Also their packaging is good. Definitely try their volcano rice. Over all a good experience. Definitely recommend.
3,"Singh Saab is fun place to hang on with family and friends. Came here this weekend to have lunch and some cocktails to enjoy üòä the food was good and ambiance was fun so was the service. I didn‚Äôt find much space and ambiance due to noise of building under construction üèó
We had lunch with cocktails to soothe and eat along. The budget was little up though worth to spend and have fun with friends and family üòãüòã go and enjoy urself to eat."

1,"Yesterday, I ordered Classic Chicken Tikka 1 kg from Swiggy; it was the worst chicken tikka I ever had in my life, undercooked and smellish. When we called for the complaint, the guy who picked up the phone just hung up.

It seems they are selling the chicken, which is stale and of bad quality.

I don't recommend ordering food from this restaurant as this was my 2nd experience."
5,"One of the best restaurant in Chembur (east). It be a Starters, Soup or Main course. We like there thai food which chef prepares it tasty. Service is very fast. Ambiance is good with music and TV. 2 wheeler parking is available on road. AC seating is down stairs."
5,Good place to visit as the food is more tasty than i thought. I called for all veg menu. Place is at decent location and easily visible. Currently it's is offering 15% off on all dine in. Same is available on dineout. Zomato is available for delivery. Now in food i ordered tomyum soup which is too good and tasty. Flavor of spices and the pitch of taste won my heart. Next step was starter. what could be better than mushroom with tofu and mixed with wok. The chef took me to next level of experience. I wanted to check if he can deliver the Easy one. I ordered for Singapore noddles street type. Finally met my expectation. Overall experience is very nice. Might be crowded later end of the day however I visited for lunch and i see no one. I forgot to mention that I also ordered for kiwi krusher during my meal. five star for chef
5,"Wow! What a delicious food!!
It was the exact expression of mine, when I recently visited one of the best and finest restaurant of Chembur, named ""Kook"". This place is located at near Basant park.

Kook, It is a really attractive name, so does the the ambiance of the restaurant. It is well decorated with wall paintings and wall quotes, which looks attractive and interesting. Although it looks smaller from outside but it's spacious from the inside.

They have indoor and outdoor seating arrangement, which is well organised and managed inrespect of couples, friends and families And have perfect and attractive combination of wooden tables and comfortable wooden chair and sofas.

Taking about service and staff. Staff is polite and professional and services given by them are quick.
Thanks to kook management to take care of us during our visit.

Talking about food..
They serves North Indian, Chinese, Mugalai cusines and they came with concept of kilo by king. In which you can order any dish from their Manu more than 1kg for your office or home parties with minimal delivery charges and they deliver their delicious food all over the Mumbai.

It's clear that politeness goes a long way ‚Äì we had a smooth experience, Kudos to Rushiket and the team for ensuring the same."

and made an ac section, so the ambience is also nice now. Service could be better.
Food rating:
Chur chur aloo kulcha - 5/5
Dal pakvan - 4/5
Cholle pattice - 4/5
Chaas 5/5"
5,Great punjabi restaurant with best with food taste. This is the best for a quick bite with your friends and family. Wide variety of food items and their taste is still the same. Service is also good and quick. Taste of Lassi was very nice.
4,"A Must-Try Breakfast Spot!
I recently had the pleasure of trying out my uncle‚Äôs restaurant, Vig, and every bite was packed with flavor and quality! From the crispy Samosa Chole to the melt-in-your-mouth Paneer Cheese Chur Chur Kulcha, this spot nailed it. And the Lassi? Just the right touch to complete a heavy, satisfying breakfast. üòç‚ù§Ô∏è

Start with their iconic Dal Pakwaan, move on to the Paneer Kulcha, and don‚Äôt miss out on the Chole Samosa. Their lassi and chaas are simply unbeatable!

Though the place is cozy with limited parking, it‚Äôs easy to find and now has an air-conditioned section with top-notch service. If soul-satisfying food is what you're after, you‚Äôve got to visit"
1,"I have ordered 2 plat daal pakwan and it costed me around 375 Rs they make fool to customer and dont have any manners how to speak with customer because they feel they‚Äôre big brands they are charging so high in 1 plate they give only 1 single pakwan and charging in the rates of 2 pakwan compare to other hotel in Mumbai, I had ordered 2 plate and just see the quantity of chutney not even full fill for 1 plate really worst experience with Vig fool making restaurant"
4,"Known for Sindhi food üç± I visited to have dal pakwan. Also ordered patties. My request for sweet khajoor chutney was instantly fulfilled by server. Both tasted yummy. I sat at ground level non Ac section and witnessed all kind of guest from teenagers to oldies. Quiet popular among all age groups.  This is my second visit after years and taste hasn‚Äôt changed much. Located at busy road of Chembur camp , parking will be a concern. Place may look dirty from out but is decently clean . Service is good. This is Sindhi version of South Indian udipis and tiffins .
Try lassi (saw them in various colors but didn‚Äôt taste one. Place is economical. Menu shared Maybe next time) Visited October 2024"
4,"I recently visited Chote Nawab in Chembur and had a wonderful experience. The restaurant has a great variety of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. We tried paneer tikka, spring roll, paneer handi with a bucket of roti, chicken biryani, and mutton rogan josh ‚Äî all the dishes were full of flavor, well-cooked, and served fresh and hot.
The place is spacious and has a comfortable seating arrangement. The overall atmosphere is calm and welcoming, making it a perfect spot for family dinners, outings with friends, or even birthday celebrations. It has a pleasant vibe that adds to the joy of dining.
Cleanliness is clearly a priority here. The dining area, tables, and washrooms were all neat and well-maintained. It felt very hygienic and well-organized.
The service was impressive too. The staff was friendly, polite, and very helpful. They were quick to respond to our needs and made sure we had everything we needed throughout the meal.
Chote Nawab is also a great place for small celebrations like birthdays. The environment is cheerful, and there‚Äôs enough space to host small gatherings comfortably. The staff is supportive and cooperative, which makes such occasions even more enjoyable.
Overall, it‚Äôs a lovely restaurant in Chembur that offers delicious food, a clean and welcoming atmosphere, and excellent service. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good place to eat or celebrate with loved ones."
5,"One of the Best family Restaurant in Chembur ‚úÖüíØ

3,"‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê 3 Star Review for Chote Nawab Chembur

Chote Nawab Chembur is a popular casual‚Äëdining restaurant located at Shop No.‚ÄØ1, Chembur Camp, Opposite Inlaks Hospital, Chembur, Mumbai, offering North Indian, Mughlai, Biryani, and Chinese specialties  Ôøº. We ordered dinner via Swiggy home delivery to catch the IPL match at home  Ôøº.

The Chicken Manchow Soup arrived hot but was average at best, with a bit too much salt that overpowered the delicate broth flavors.
The Chicken Manchurian, however, was the star of the show‚Äîsucculent, soft pieces bathed in a perfectly balanced tangy‚Äësweet sauce that truly impressed.

Our Mutton Biryani was below average: the portion included only one small piece of mutton, the rice was overly spicy, and the meat could have been more tender.

Visually, the Chicken Fried Rice looked fantastic and tasted exactly as it appeared‚Äîfluffy grains studded with crisp veggies and light seasoning.
The Butter Chicken was pretty good, featuring a rich, creamy gravy, though the chicken pieces themselves could have been softer to match the luscious sauce.

Packaging was secure, keeping all dishes warm throughout the IPL match. Overall, Chote Nawab Chembur earns a solid 3 star rating for its standout Chicken Manchurian and Fried Rice, dependable delivery, and cozy at‚Äëhome dining experience‚Äîwhile leaving room for improvement in soup seasoning, biryani portions, and meat tenderness.

We‚Äôll definitely think about reordering  the Manchurian and Fried Rice on our next IPL night!"
2,"When you are craving for some Indian Chinese then this is the place to order some affordable Indian Chinese delicacies.
We took a takeaway from here. The things we ordered was
Thread chicken
Chicken kebab
Chicken hongkong rice
The taste was not that great. Though it's affordable but truly the food totally was not at all worth"
5,"Best Chinese Food In chembur .
Must try Chinese starters are lipsmacking.
Usually I order for zomato and swiggy .
Quantity and Quality is best , Value for money!"
5,"This is one of the best Chinese corner in the city for their quality taste and the flavours. I ordered for chicken lollipop, the classic and mouth-watering with Schezwan chutney. Also tried chicken spring roll which was so yummy and tasty. My favourite was chicken Hong - Kong noodles which was so good and delicious. Highly recommended. The delivery was safe."

I ordered for :-
Chicken lollipop which was so tasty and spicy. Loved it.
Chicken Schezwan rice which was so yummy and the chunks of chicken were good.
Must try their chicken Hong Kong noodles which was mouth-watering. Highly recommended.

Starters were crispy & mouth watering. Rice was nicely cooked & has nice aroma.
Me & my friend really loved it.
Suggested to order once."
5,Good for middle class people.. taste was to good. But need clean and tidy area. Tea is not good but ok ok taste. Most of drivers and office staff was found there for taste. Best to eat onion bhaji and samosa and other refreshments.. over all nice foodmall...
3,"Best place for quick and cheap fast food.
During rush hour you have shared tables and must try their yellow chutney and samosa"
2,"A below average fast food centre. If you are looking for a decent ambience and good quality fast food , this restaurant is not recommended. Good to take away parcels. Its a common centre for local economic class people such as labours or daily wages earning people."
3,Very old shop. Can be more better the interior is not so good. We had samosas which were average.
5,"This is a vintage place for me as my school was nearby.
Samosa party with tea is one of the famous thing to enjoy eating among the crowd who visit here."
1,"Extremely bad quality of fish
Very rude owner don't know lady was owner or what if go to complain plz don't go there suresh fish ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢"
1,Owner has very rude behaviour and also fish Ary not fresh at all  waste of money if you buying anything from here
1,Bought 1.5 kgs from Suresh fish point and it was the worst prawn ever. Not only it was smelling funny but also it turned out to be hard and chewy... Extremely bad experience. Even if you pay good money still you can't get good stuff... Never ordering from here
1,"Ordered 1 kg prawns through big basket specialty store Suresh fish point. Experience this time was bad since prawns had strange smell, too hard and either stale or very low quality compared to price. Disappointed. never going to buy from this place again"
5,Nice n always fresh fish available here.
1,Worst food ever had. Garlic chicken ordered. Chicken was very hard and to much maida coated not fresh Chicken also.chicken soup tasted like tomato sauce. ... Don't waste the money. Much better u can have street food.
1,"Food is horrible. I ordered kung Pao chicken. It was full of corn flour and no chicken. The waiter was extremely arrogant and did not have basic etiquette‚Äôs around customer. The other waiters meanwhile stand and laugh from front to back in very shabby language. No peace to eat, no good food. DEFINITELY NO NO!"
1,"Food : food taste was wow 5stars
Service: pathetic literally took 1hr just toh get 1 starter. Very very poor service. The order taking person was really nice and gentleman but who takes 1hr for 1dish I think they should hire more chefs."
1,We're waiting from atleast 30mins they doesn't even ask or listen our and worst management and customer service ever suggest you to never visit here üôè
1,"Nice food.
But worst services.
Waiter's are too late to take orders and after ordering it took more then 30mins"
5,"Best place for good north indian food, and its cheap also. Good ambiance."
5,The budget friendly place to eat food in chembur. The restaurant is oldest in chembur and the quantity and quality of food is awesome Try there special Thali and Deluxe Thali as well.
1,Worst food I ordered tandoori roti as for parcel they gave burn chapati
5,"A very nice budget restaurant in the Chembur camp area.
The location is easily approachable by public transport - monorail and buses.
The food quality is great and nice tasting too.
Wide range of vegetarian menu options are available.
Prices are nominal and value for money is good too.
Overall ambience can be a bit old style but it doesn't hamper the experience.
Well recommended overall."
5,"Quite a regular visitor of this place. Food is awesome. It is tasty and hygienic. Expect a bit of delay in service as it full during the operations. Parking may be an issue in sometime. Ghee Chapati takes lesser time than ghee roti. You can take food parcels. I also tasted the sweet lassi, which I admit is among the best. Overall an excellent experience in terms of food."
5,Food which is fresh and made as per your instructions... Many jain options and very delicious...kid friendly too... would recommend
5,"Paprika Restaurant Club Emerald is a must-visit spot for foodies. The menu features a range of exquisite dishes prepared with fresh ingredients, and the ambiance is sophisticated yet cozy. The service is top-notch, making for a truly memorable dining experience."
1,"Earlier, it was open for non members. Now the claw of non serving to non members isn't mentioned anywhere. We went there at 10:00 pm on a Wednesday, expecting to have our dinner.
After going there they just dined to serve us. The staff was arrogant and irresponsible. Inhuman behavior."
5,"Amazing menu with great options and variety.

Pure veg
and they even serve No onion, No garlic option, if you request"
5,Awesome food and service and best hospitality highly recommended
5,Reasonable but you have managed with the atmosphere. Very noisy after 700 hrs. Food and service is very good.
2,Food quality is not good as compare to rate normal Chicken Chilli rate is 350 but the taste is not good in fact chicken chill from street is better.
4,"Good option in chembur for downing a few drinks with tasty food. Sevice is fast and all dishes served hot. The drinks and food is moderately priced and seating is full many times.
There is an adjoining orchestra bar option too which is worth a try.
Overall worth a second visit."
5,Nice and affordable place. Be aware of butter naan though. Smoke and drink abundantly and food is excellent. Service is top notch without any delay and staff is cordial and interpret non verbal orders well. Location is suitable and easy to locate and there is almost no hassle whatsoever. Will go back there again.
2,Very cheap bar. No quality service. Food is below average. Ambience is like a local desi bar. Above all on the ground floor they have those cheap bar and on the Above floor they have lived orchestra but no good. It Is only more of a pickup joint kind of place as girls dances there and people drink and throw money on these girls. It is not a decent place for decent people.
5,If you want to have the real vada pav this the place to visit then. They also offer tasty sindhi dal pakwan on sunday and heavy chola bhatura! At very affordable price ! I just love it! Highly recommended!!
3,It's a small snacks centre with a departmental store attached next to it. The samosa's are my personal favourite. At times it does serve Sindhi dishes like Dal pakvan but it's not a regular menu item
5,"Awesome food.  Vada pav, samosa usal, poha and alu bhajiya yaar the best things to try here from morning  9 to  afternoon 4 pm and on sunday you must try for DAL PAKWAN.  Hygiene level is also maintained."
5,They serve everything awesome and their shezwan chutney is a addon. Their sunday special Daal pakwan is something I can die for
4,"The short bt sweet place
You will get the best dal pakwan
You ll get the best poha n all the snacks here are very nice"
1,The service is extremely poor. We had come to the resturant early and had ordered couple of dishes. They served us the starters and as the resturant kept getting busier they forgot to prepare our main course. We waited almost an hour to hear sorry sir we will start the preparation now. 0/5 stars. Will never recommend anyone for their Chembur branch.
2,Menu card rates shown on website are much cheaper than actual menu card in hotel. In AC dining hall smoking is allowed irrespective of No smoking sign. Quality of food was below average.... prawn pieces were floating in oil. They were hard to bite..... better hotels are available in Mumbai.... Not at all recommended but I will not visit again...
4,We went to this place for dinner. For starters we ordered chicken crispy which was excellent. The quantity is also good and taste is nice. For main course we ordered chicken dum biryani. Taste and quantity both are good. The place has good ambience. They have indoor ac seating. It's hygienic and service is also good . Staff is also polite. The pricing of starters is a bit high. But overall it was a very good experience. They have valet parking.
5,"I guess it was great place to visit with your family, friends and kids too. Y'all can bring your kids here without any hesitation as child enjoy there with seats and the setup is made like that.
Very dime and soft lighting is present inside the restaurant y'all will enjoy being there as a Aircondition is all over in the hotel.
My goodness the food was actually delicious and gave the hom feeling food especially malavni taste! Fish fry , crabs lollipop, prawns lobster were the starter .
Just it takes time cook and serve the food.
And the staff ,owner were so polite and gentle.
I think once you should visit there You'll love it.
Come with whoever you want to be with..!
And I hope You'll enjoy the rest...!
And yes you can drink too hahahaha..!"
3,The place is really good for drinks but didnt liked the taste much i orderd a bhakri to have with fish the bhakri was literaly not cooked or rosted the chicken crispy was not crispy but was soft though the chicken that the offered was good but overall unsatisfied
5,"All the products in the shop are fantastic.
Especially Rava Laddu.
Melts in the mouth.
I bet it will be the best Rava Laddu you have ever tasted."
4,"It's beautiful restaurant having buffet lunch as well as ala karte menu.
Neat and clean food , courteous service  and reasonable rates."
5,They keep some exclusive items along with breakfast and snacks. Though on the expensive side the quality is very good. Do try breakfast items.
5,One of the best
5,
1,"There is a reason why you don't place an order from a place like this. Order a toast sandwich, a veg sandwich and a noodle Frankie.

Despite leaving instructions that sandwiches should not have butter or beet, both were put. The frankie was undercooked, oily, cold and the noodles inside were raw. The only veggies used was chopped cabbage. Nothing else. Absolutely pathetic food. No love or care. These guys don't seem to be proud of their food."
2,It is hassle to get anything done. For a new connection you need to first get a number in your bldg. Then depending on that no. U will b informed whether u can get connection or u need to go to another exchange...
4,Helpful ladies. Work gets done almost in a single trip. Better go a bit late in the morning as the staff come to office later than the official starting time.
1,Pathetic guys. No one will take any responsibility. One will direct to the other - saying we cannot help it you have to speak to xyz.. and then all the alphabets in ABCD will get over.
3,"Found them to be helpful, that is compared to other government offices."
1,"Worst Experience Ever at Link View Hotel ‚Äì Rude and Unprofessional Waiters!

I rarely leave reviews, but my experience at Link View Hotel was so terrible, I feel obligated to warn others. The waiters here were shockingly rude and completely unprofessional. From the moment we arrived, their attitude was dismissive and arrogant.

We were spoken to with zero respect, ignored multiple times while trying to place an order, and treated like a burden rather than guests. One waiter even rolled his eyes when we asked for a basic request like water. Instead of making our stay pleasant, their behavior ruined what could have been a relaxing time.

Hospitality is about making guests feel welcome ‚Äî something this hotel clearly doesn‚Äôt understand. Management seriously needs to retrain or replace their staff. I will never return to this place, and I highly recommend others stay away unless they enjoy being insulted and ignored."
4,"This place is a great option for people seeking Indian cuisine around the Borivali and Khandivali areas. It is closer towards the link road and has sufficient parking around the main roads and by lanes.  Simple Indian food with no much fuss is the summary of this review.

The interiors are just about average, however, it has well-spread sections to find your privacy.
Service is perhaps the highlight with personal attention to each table.
The quantity was massive with even healthy appetite eaters, struggling to finish a full course Indian meal.
Pricing was decent assuming the healthy serving portions.
Presentation ‚Äì Melamine plates used at a fine dine? I am not a fan of this honestly.  It lacked creativity here.
Menu design ‚Äì I love simple menus but only text is a struggle. Especially when this is fine dining category.
The desert menu was about just okay.

We had tried the following:
‚ñ∂Non Alcoholic Mojito
‚ñ∂Veg Noorani Kebab
‚ñ∂Chicken Alishaan Kebab ‚Äì **Must try
‚ñ∂Sabji Rangoli ‚Äì **Must try
‚ñ∂Chicken Peshawari
‚ñ∂Veg Biryani
‚ñ∂Caramel Custard

Overall a decent place if specially for the nearby residents and family groups.
Recommend the mgmt. to be a little more creative on the presentation and the menu creativity."
5,"Link View is a amazing family restaurant for any occasions like birthdays, anniversary, farewells and many more.
We had the Link view special fruit punch which was amazing n so fruity,Deep blue sea which took us at the beach,Virgin Mojito a perfect drink,Green island which had a amazing coconut taste. For starter we had the Chicken Peri peri tikka which was Spicy n full of Amazing flavour,Panner in Five Spice which was a simple panner Chinese dish to overcome your Chinese cravings. Thai Veg Curry In green sause with steamed rice was so yummy with so rich taste , Chicken Peshwari Masala paired excellent with Roti,Chocolate dad and Gudbad Ice-cream we amazing desert that we had. So full of goodnessüòç"
5,Great service & taste is good. Staff is very nice.  Bit expensive but worth paying after service and attention you get.  Prefer to have food as staff say.  You may ask them to make dish spicy or whatever you want. Should go atleast once so that to visit #LinkView Occasionally
5,"Quite a nice place and good food. Very clean and friendly staff

Went back last night. Good service and hygiene. Food although was a bit on the spicier side. Pricing is premium but to be expected considering the ambience and service."
5,Authentic maharashtrian food is served here not too spicy food
5,"It's a very good place and the food is really yummy.
If anyone likes the Misal pav and Vada pav this place is highly recommended.
They also serve kothimbir vadi which is really good."
1,Delivered the Misal in cheap plastic bags. Should use good quality food boxes
1,"The person charges a higher amt. Compared to the items we had, we had a regular misal pav & a batata vada plate the actual amt to be paid was 135 whether he charged us 155."
3,It's a good place always with options of local foods.

Few things to highlight that I really found nice:-
1. My first visit was really very warm and welcoming.
2. The Chinese food was made without ajinomoto and artificial colours.
3. The staff was polite and helpful."
3,"The food test was awesome, nearly a blend of Chinese but I say it is better then average but not expected High if you want clean and average exotic Chinese taste
The price was nearly high and the portion size average."
1,"Ambience & Service was fine, but the taste and quality of the food is not very good.
We ordered manchow soup which was good but the chicken hot wings were so bad in taste.
Chef fried with vegetables
We return the same but again he gave us the same dish.
The chef gave us pieces of lollipop which he fried in extra soy and chili sauce.

then we ordered Veg Noodles which was too salty & extra vinegar.

i will not recommend this to my friends..."
5,Good dine out with pleasant feel like a find dine restaurant
1,"Very expensive to give food in plastic bags
Recently placed order for delivery,they still give you food in plastic bags which make the chicken crispy soggy and can't eat it later.The taste was very bad,I used to go here but the taste is deteriorating,"
4,"Mexichino is a cozy, hidden treasure in Borivali West. It offers a unique and memorable dining experience through its inventive fusion of Mexican and Chinese vegetarian cuisine. The charming atmosphere, friendly service, and delicious food make it a must-visit for vegetarians and fusion food lovers alike. Whether you‚Äôre a local or just visiting, MexiChino is definitely worth a stop. Always full so we had to wait , the  waiting time is 15 to 30 minutes. Mexichino offers a delightful fusion of Mexican and Chinese cuisine. The nachos are crispy with a perfect balance of toppings, while the sizzlers are flavorful and satisfying. The pizza is a tasty blend of traditional and exotic flavors, making it a must-try.
Quantity is pretty good and satisfying for the cost it is offered."
3,"Nice food joint. They serve mexican and Chinese cuisines. Food was decent. Mexican could have been more authentic but still it was good trying.
Pizza was average, could have been better.
Service was good."
5,Very tasty food . Loved the ambience. Clean place. Food quality n quantity was very good. Worth for money value.
1,I went here on a Sunday and ordered Mac N cheese and Water Chestnut Corn Java Lotus stem and the food stinked of stale garlic. I asked the staff to have it changed and he refused saying it‚Äôs supposed to be like this. I‚Äôve been to this place several times before but never again.

4,"Kaffeine, which was earlier located next to vijay sales on sv road, is revamped and moved to the current place in shimpoli with a larger area and modern ambience which is very welcoming.

It offers indoor and outdoor seating, and a pretty good menu items (only veg).

Tried the below items:

1. Pesto Hummus with Pita

-It was decent, and we had to order extra pita to finish the hummus.

2. Creamy Mushroom and caramalized onion sandwich

-The dish is good but the quantity and stuffing is very less for the price. I also feel if they add spinach to this, it would taste even better, but thats just my personal opinion as I have had pizza with this same combination and loved it.

3. Tres Leches

- Its a sponge cake soaked in mixture of 3 types of milk. The presentation was good and lives up to its name

4. Cinnamon Chai

-Was happy to see this than the usual masala, ginger, cardamom and lemongrass tea. Served with couple of Parle G biscuits.

5. Classic Koffrappee

- It's basically a Coffee Frappe. Served with cookie.

Overall, it's a great cafe in Borivali and offers a wider veg food menu compared to Starbucks and Thirdwave. But it's slightly expensive and the quantity is less for the price."
5,"Lovely place! Lovely food!
They have got delicious food & most of the options are jain.
There is a lovely wall where you can stick notes where in the note you can write whatever you wish to.
Should definitely try their Balinese curry if you‚Äôre eating food. It is basically Thai curry, but tastes very good."
4,Visited here for a morning coffee with my fiancee. I was impressed by its ambience and interiors. We ordered Cafe Latte with mint flavour and caramel affogato. Service was great. Latte was exactly how I wanted it and so was the affogato. They gave a small cookie with both the coffees. Overall impressed with their coffee. Would definitely visit again to try their food.
5,"What a hidden gem! ‚ù§Ô∏èüòçI stumbled upon this caf√©, and it instantly became my new favorite spot. The moment you walk in, you're greeted by such a cozy, inviting atmosphere.üòÅ
‚Äî it's like stepping into a little oasis. The interior is beautifully designed, with unique touches that make it feel both stylish and relaxed. üòå
The coffee? Perfectly brewed, and the menu has some delightful treats that pair wonderfully with every sip. The staff was warm and welcoming, adding to the overall fantastic vibe. Whether you're here for a quick pick-me-up or a long afternoon, this place is definitely worth a visit. Can‚Äôt wait to come back! HIGHLY Recommended üòâ"
5,"Kaffeine in Borivali truly lives up to the cozy and aesthetic vibes! The ambience was incredibly soothing and calm, making it a perfect spot to unwind. I loved the unique touch of customer reviews adorning the walls ‚Äì it adds a personal and warm feel. As a pet lover, the fact that it's pet-friendly is a huge plus!
The food was definitely a highlight. I highly recommend trying their Sobo Cheese Chilli Maggi and the Chatpata Khichiya for a burst of flavor. For dessert, the Berry Cheesecake and Tres Leches were absolutely divine. The Harabhara Kebab and Mexican Delight were also delicious savory options, and the Sea Salt Caramel Ocean Latte was a delightful and unique beverage. What's even better is that an impressive 90% of their menu is available in Jain, catering to a wider range of preferences. Overall, Kaffeine is a must-visit in Borivali for its lovely atmosphere, delicious food, and thoughtful inclusivity."
1,"They provided a pretty good offer over zomato and once we made an order of almost 24 donuts and they didn't deliver the order and asked zomato to cancel it.

Point is if they can't serve the offer why they provide an offer."
4,"MOD Donuts is an exciting and innovative donut shop that provides a unique and enjoyable experience. The customizable concept, quality ingredients, and creative atmosphere make it a standout choice for donut lovers. While the wait times and pricing might be a bit higher, the overall experience is well worth it. If you're looking for a place to satisfy your donut cravings with a touch of creativity, MOD Donuts is a fantastic choice."
4,"I have ordered three times from MOD (Never been at the physical store).

Honestly, the first two times donuts were flawless. Taste was amazing. They were fluffy and smooth. However, last night I ordered for the third time and as much as I'm sad to say it, I got disappointed. I could easily tell that they were not fresh at all. Fluffiness was also gone. They felt much flatter and hard.

The experience was way different than before. I might give it a try next time, from a different outlet though. I hope this was just a one time incident as they were my place-to-order when I needed an answer to my sweet cravings."
5,"My favourite places to grab some delicious donuts.
They offer take away, dine in and delivery.
Donuts are are super soft and fresh, they have bite sized doubts and cute waffles as well, this place is perfect for dessert lovers.
I love their classic coco loco it has sugar coating and coconut flakes and midnight beauty which has dark chocolate.
Tastes better after heating."
4,Has one of the best donuts in town with a lot of Varieties...use some deals available online to get good combos....Swirl it up and Krunch Kraze a must try....the place is generally filled with couples. A must visit place for sweet and desserts lovers
2,"Visited this weekend for dinner

Honestly didn't like the food at all

Ordered manchow soup üç≤  he brought soup in less than 1 min and not at all taste in food - entire lasoon part coming in mouth and also it was cooked properly

Thought may be we should order some other variety tried masala dosa only chutney was good too oily aloo masala"
5,"Nice place, part of a chain. It is a good place for Udupi/South Indian food.
The place is spacious, the tables are well set and there is enough space between tables, unlike in most restaurants in Mumbai."
1,"Food was awesomely pathetic.
Dal Makhani, very common delicacies, which is a normal part of every restaurant, don't exist there. Simple Aloo Methi, but they give only in Red Gravy, God knows what's dish is this. Next next punjabi dish, another dish in Red Gravy. So adding 1 ingredient in their common red gravy, makes multiple dish, causing NO TASTE to exist in anything.
Every dish is genuinely very expensive, quantity without Taste or no taste. I don't understand why people go there. Masala Papad makes it cost 80 in non AC, with minimal toppings on it, what's the use. Every punjabi dish is above 300 minimum. So 2 people costing a minimum bill of 1000/-.
Not that worth, HONESTLY, I RATE IN TERMS OF FOOD, SERVICE, ATMOSPHERE, BEHAVIOUR, DONT WASTE YOUR TIME, MONEY, GOOD MOMENTS AT ALL..."
4,Great paneer pakodas and food in general.. ambience and service isn't bad either. Prices are also reasonable. I'm a frequent customer here and would very much recommend it!
5,The food was awesome and the service was good and comfortable waiting seating and also relaxing atmosphere
1,"Recently I have visited at famous The veg treat  NX Resturant & i ordered fried rice and guess what  they just give me normal fried rice after I notice the same they  just mixed Schezwan in fired rice and served !!! &  worst part is  behaviour of staff (Ek tho itna cost upar se itna attitude).
.0 for this behaviour and .0.0000 rating as well"
5,Punjabi food over here is very good. The restaurant is widespread hence ample space is a big positive. AC section is relatively small. It's a famous restaurant in this locality hence generally crowded especially on weekends.
5,A nice place with good ambience. It is over crowded so make sure you do booking prior. Service is very fast. Recommended

It has huge sitting area. They have sitting area in open as well as both AC and NON AC sections. We had been to this place for lunch. I think waiting would hardly be a problem here since they have such huge capacities. This place has no valet parking available so please think about it before coming here. The food here has real good flavours. Service can get a little slow when the rush increases. The place overall is good and worth visiting again.

The service is quick, and the desserts are delicious. I got curious about the desserts and asked them‚Äîthey said they‚Äôre made fresh in-house, which is amazing.

We always eat

Chicken Tornado

Words can't express the taste and feel of pizza.

2,"Had a B1G1 free course so ordered a zesty paneer which was quite good 3/5 but the four cheese one has just mozzarella and liquid cheese on it ,would rate it 1/5 just for the fresh dough but pizza was not saucy enough. Another thing the pizzas were still hot and i overall would rate it 2.5/5."
5,"Excellent Pizza Sandwich! So well made coming, yummy and value for money.... Full of vegetables and mayo, just for 179! Loved it."
5,"Without a doubt, this is the ultimate pizza destination in Mumbai, outshining all the popular pizza outlets. The flavors are exceptional, the crust is perfectly crispy, and the toppings are simply delectable. With a good range of both veg and non veg options to choose from"
5,Great Taste and Value for money. First time with Smokin Joe's Pizzas but satisfied with all options Quantity and value for money deals. Also thank you for best recommendations pizza options via team they only serve you best quality.
4,"The restaurant is specialist of kakhano cuisine. If you are find of Kanakani food and wants to have of best quality for a 3 course meal, this restaurent should be choice. You can go hear with family and friends.

About food, they make everything freshly so tarate of food is awesome. The bhakri is best so far I have. They cook multiple types of starters on different fishes and chicken, but I would recommend you to have fish because it is speciality of them.

They have an ac sitting area. The ambience is not so great but it is clean.

The restaurent is situated at Western expressway beside the entry of Siddharth Nagar. You can reach hear from Kandivali or borivali by train then share auto to Thakur complex or Thakur village or you can hire a personal rikashaw too. Fare will be around 35 rupees."
1,"""I recently visited this restaurant with my family and had an extremely disappointing experience. The plates and utensils were not properly cleaned, and to make matters worse, cat hair was found everywhere, including on the tables. I strongly advise anyone considering ordering from this restaurant to visit in person and inspect the cleanliness"
3,"We had three dishes - Baby Surmai tawa fry, pomfret tawa fry and in sikka masala.

The taste was ok .The service is very good and they were good at suggesting the dishes. it seems to be a little overpriced but we were still ok as they made the food to order"
4,"The place is in between borivali east & kandivali east. Interior design is very good.  Non veg food is also great.
Place is not big enough. Also its take time to deliver the foods."
5,"Had an unplanned visit to this restaurant.
The manager was very courteous and witty.
Had bombil fry, chicken koliwada and prawns biryani. All of the dishes were authentic, fresh and delicious.
It really felt like we teleported to Goa for a while. Thanks for the awesome experience !!"
5,"I had a great experience at Tiotop Grand Thali! The food was delicious, healthy, and prepared with minimal oil, making it both tasty and light. The staff was very polite and well-organized, ensuring a pleasant dining experience. A special mention to Manager Mukesh Rajput, who made sure our food was served quickly without us even having to call for assistance. Excellent service and hospitality‚ÄîI highly recommend this place!"
5,"‚ÄúAbsolutely delightful! The Grand Thali at Tip Top Plaza truly lives up to its name ‚Äì every bite was a burst of flavour and tradition. Perfect blend of quality, quantity, and hospitality!‚Äù"
5,"The food quality is fresh and amazing, with ample choices. The dishes are flavorful yet not overly spicy, making them enjoyable. What stood out was the special treatment given to my son, ensuring that he was comfortable and well-catered for. The service was top-notch.

Truly a memorable dining experience."
5,"We have been their customers since more than 10 years. We always enjoy eating their grand thali. All their items(sabzi, curry,sweets, roti, khichdi,etc) are very tasty. It is always a great experience eating at tip top plaza.

I have one suggestion. I have noticed that most of their sabzi & curries have onion/garlic. It would be nice if there is at least 1 item without onion/garlic. This will help people following sattwik and jain diet.

Thank you for your wonderful service. You are a blessing for Thanekars. Keep it up."
5,"We had dinner at Amras thali.
Unlimited Excellent vegetarian thali including panipuri.

1,"Worst chole bhature ever ... The bhature was hard as a cardboard, strongly non recommend restraunt"
5,Check out variety of parathas !!!
5,Good food and good service
1,Very bad experience. Pizza base and momo was uncooked but when we made it notice by staff they simply wave it off and ignorant after visual proof. Not at all upto the mark
1,"Worst experience ever !!

I‚Äôm writing to express my deep disappointment with my recent order. I had placed an order for two pizzas, but I received only one. I waited patiently for the second one, expecting it to arrive shortly. After 30 minutes of waiting, I was informed that only one pizza had been ordered‚Äîdespite the fact that I very clearly ordered and paid for two.

Not only was the service careless, but the way it was handled left me feeling completely ignored and disrespected. I was left hungry and extremely upset, which is not something I ever expected from your establishment. This experience was frustrating, time-wasting, and honestly ruined what was supposed to be a simple, happy meal.

I expect a proper explanation and some form of compensation for the inconvenience caused. I hope you take this matter seriously, because this kind of service is absolutely unacceptable."
1,Restaurant opens at 11 am but till 1 pm there are no staff and other members till 12 pm and i order from app at 11.30 and I can't received my order till 1 pm. I wait in the restaurant for almost 1.15hr just for the order and non of the staff is available in front desk. Bad experience üëéüèªüëéüèª
1,"I‚Äôd give zero stars if I could honestly. Please avoid this place like you can.
The staff wasn‚Äôt looking to have any new guests in the restaurant. Took them more than 5 mins to even acknowledge us and the only meaningful thing we got out of them was that the food would take us 45 mins at minimum.

Half the dine in section was closed off and the tables weren‚Äôt cleaned

I chose to take my family to urban tadka next doors who were more than happy to have us"
1,"The place was unhygienic ,cockroaches were roaming in dining table and on sofa ,in our Chicken sausage pizza the chicken sausage were rotten.worst experience"

1,I had specifically ordered a cake with fresh cream.. but this guy cheated us with some random cake!!! This spoiled our our birthday party.. this is not acceptable!! Overall monginis cake quality had degraded a lot... :( :( never going order monginis cake now..
1,Worst service. They charge even for paper bags where as other bakeries don't charge. Trying to justify their mistakes. Quality also bad. Will not recomend any one to go at this shop. Cakes are also not fresh.
5,"The Owner is humble and a very co operative person, he suggested good options and served good quality food stuff. I have been visiting this shop for many years now, the owner has consistently provided appropriate services and quality food products."

4,"I tried out panner shawarma and taste was really good.
Size avail 6 and 8 inch 150 & 170.
It was too heavy even 6inch ."
3,This place is very close by to my house but I never tried their shawarmas. It has very limited seating like outdoor seating which can accommodate 7-8 people min. I tried their Chicken Schezwan Shawarma (8 inches) which was an absolute worth a try. The chicken was juicy and fresh also the stuffings were good. Pricing was also reasonable. Will definitely try their other shawarmas soon.

In USA suited white executive s que up at lunch time at Iskons restaurant s! Why ? Krishnaji ko Prasad dharane ke bad the food is served! Mithas aati hai!"
4,"The buffet experience has been unchanged for a long time sans the thali price. Their seasonal aamras is not to be skipped. Since the lockdown my appetite had drastically reduced and in this scenario thali is really a waste. But had to go with some colleagues.
Over all the taste was good along with the speed of serving (which is very important in case of an unlimited thali). If you want to experience speed visit Sasuma Ki Thali or Kansaar in Surat. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.
Ample of parking available. No √Ä la carte option.
Pro-tip: hog less on the panipuris. üò¨"
1,Worst experience with accommodation they Mannager is trying to convience me at 11:40 of night after distrubing from my sleep to take one person to add in my room and giving balme to their system problem that he had mistake. Profenalism is missing here for Hospitalisation.
5,Omg! The food is soo damn good. I've eaten both thali and buffet food and i loved it! It is absolutely Worth it! I loved the buffet one because there are variety of deserts including starters are available. But so sad the buffet system is not available. I don't know why. Hope it will start soon‚ô•Ô∏è

About the main part, the food was just straight up unbeatable.

Varieties of deserts were available. U gotta try butter naan over there üòú.

Loved it"
5,Good place and shop
1,"Look at the eggs, this is not what you serve. Spoiled our day with such food delivery. Also no idea what they added to the food. I woke up coughing a lot in the middle of the night...such horrible experience. Won't order anything ever again"
1,"Last few experiences were not good at all.
Chicken lollipop was stale, Chicken Shwarma not having enough chicken pieces.  Despite being a regular customer I will refrain from getting orders from Kadam's cafe going forward."
1,Try to avoid this at any cost. Menu is so vast and unnecessary. Food is pathetic. Portions are too small and you will feel robbed.
1,"I am totally dissatisfied with a food which I ordered (chiken dishes)on yesterday night and found that

1. Chiken pieces are too big in size and its not cooked properly.
2. Gravy has no taste of chiken. Only some coconut masalas (not fried properly) are their which we are using regularly. Means no taste at all.
Hence no flavour found in both the dishes.

Inform you chef to be careful while making dishes particularly non veg."
4,"Five-Star Experience at Kadam Cafe: ""I recently visited Kadam Cafe and had an exceptional experience. The cozy ambiance, combined with attentive and friendly staff, made for a welcoming atmosphere. The menu boasted a delightful variety of dishes, each prepared with precision and flavor. I particularly enjoyed [mention a specific dish], which was a culinary delight. The attention to detail and commitment to quality at Kadam Cafe truly sets it apart. I highly recommend this cafe for a delightful dining experience!"""
5,"Good variety of cakes, pastries, puff pastries, and packed snacks. It‚Äôs a small store but conveniently located and reasonably priced. Their chicken puffs and rolls are a must try."
1,"Picked up a cake specifically mentioning it has to be a fresh cream cake, next the flavour was supposed to be Dutch Truffle, none of them specifications matched, utterly disappointed, 450 bucks wasted and mood kharab huva woh alag."
1,"Very worst Experience of Monginis we given order for birthday and they told me they Deliver the cake in afternoon and we waiting till evening but they didn't even and not even taking my call's . The worst service I ever received.
Sab bolte hai Monginis ek Brand hai but sachi Mai toh bhangar hai esse ache se baki brands hai atleast call utha ke report toh karte hai whatever the situation was . I am not buying any thing from Monginis.üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°"
5,The shop is great and staff are also nice. The cake are different when u see pictures and taste it . The picture are good but the cake is more good and tasty üòã. Yes it's a lit bit expensive. But If u love cake then u should buy it and enjoy. The place is easily noticable. It's connected to main road. Very nice place. Available in Mulund also
1,I have order 5Kg cake for my daughter birthday and day of booking they told they will deliver but on delivery day they have asked me to pick up. I went there to pick up and worst thing was no proper handbag to carry that... because of all these Monjinis service is not good nowadays.
4,"Nice restaurant for fast food. Serves vegetarian food. Try cheese paneer tawa pulav, pani puri. Sitting area is small hence conjusted. Not suitable for group of over 4. Order online through swiggy, zomato, uber eats.polite and courteous staff. Parking available. Located in main area."
4,"Great option in this locality for paav bhaji, juices, chaat items and sandwiches. Food is good and prices reasonably well. Little place to sit but they do offer home delivery which is good."
3,Local place to get some food. Quality not too great..ok ok.
3,"Seating is small n feels very hot inside...no ac,,,,food is ok....I feel slightlyoverpriced.....but gives free home delivery ,,,,, within nearby areas"
4,Tasty food. Dependable option for home delivery. Try Veg cheese sandwich and masala toast. You can pay via PAYtm.
4,"Commendable. Yesterday visited this place with family just 5 min walk from Thane stn west. We all Enjoyed food. Best quality and hot chapatis served. They have multiple options for thali wilth variety of bhaji. We missed their Masale bhaat ( Only on Saturday) which we have craved for.
Overall is nice. Wish to visit again on Saturday."
2,"Overrated restaurant, food quality is below satisfactory, rice was pathetic, gravy was oily. Thali is bit expensive for the food they offer. We ordered ‚ÄúPiyush‚Äù but the curd used for it was not fresh. They are cashing on the name and years of experience. I will not recommend this restaurant."
4,"Swad Thali lives up to its name by offering a true taste of India on one plate. Each thali is a perfect balance of variety, freshness, and authentic flavors. The portions are generous, the service is prompt, and the homely vibe makes the whole experience even better. A must-visit for anyone who loves wholesome, traditional Indian food!"
5,"Clean place and good homely maharashtrian food. We usually order the limited thali, alu vadi and sabudana vada. During Diwali season, you can buy Chirote which is a traditional maharashtrian, crispy and flaky sweet. It is kept on display in the waiting area and is so fresh and just beyond delicious!! Give it a try if you are in the neighbourhood."
5,"Quick service and great healthy food options. Treat for someone who would want to try some Maharashtrian food. Thali is great. Plenty of snacks options, very homely food."
4,"The atmosphere of this place was really peaceful and song choice was on point.we ordered coffee piramisu, mocha frapp√©, lemony chicken sandwich, pink creamy chicken pasta, bagelious chicken. The chicken in lemony chicken sandwich was so perfectly cooked and sandwich was so tasty. Same goes with other foods, they were on point. And the pricing of menu is in budget with such a good taste. Would recommend to come here for date or some outing."
2,"Request to owners. There is a high footfall in the cafe during the peak noon time, your staff also has lunch time in the cafe space. To avoid space crunch, please change the tables of central row so that people with laptops, etc. can also utilise that space which is generally avoided. Also particularly the morning staff is comparatively less accommodative in their attitude towards regular customers. The kitchen is full of noise created by petty fights among the staff. Staff also at times show frustrations towards customer treatment. Otherwise the food is top notch üå∑"
2,"Cozy Cafe, Not Ideal for Remote Work
Love and Latte is a charming cafe with a cozy atmosphere, perfect for a casual hangout or a quick bite. However, it's not the best choice for remote work. The tables are small, and the layout is more suited for a cafe than a co-working space. We managed to make it work by using a larger table, but it was still a bit cramped.

The charging ports were hidden beneath the tables, which was inconvenient. Additionally, food delivery was slow, with our Bombay sandwich taking nearly 45 minutes to arrive. Parking can be a challenge, as there are no options nearby, and the paid parking is far"
1,"We have ordered Nutella hot chocolate for amt 273/- Reg size, and it was not at all worth the cost it was tasting like bornvita even Bornvita tastes good than this and only inspite of few customer 2-3 service was slow as well, would obviously never come, and suggest people not to go."
4,"The ambience is good.
Service is also good.
Tried Nutella donut not too good, didn't like it.
Pink grapefruit and lichi cooler, it was too sweet maybe you can say them to make it little less sweet.
Also tried hot coffee capuchino, it was ok ok.

Basically it is good for ambience, but not a very good food options.
Also it's a little bit pricy."
5,"This is my go to restaurant for Mangalorean food.

Have visited countless times during lunch hours. I have tried kori roti, prawns pulimunchi, pomfret thali, vegetarian thali etc. Food was always consistently tasty and fresh. Prices are reasonable and service is good. Waiters are attentive.

Worth a try!"
4,"Specially known for sea food
Food taste is very good but not awesome
Price is very reasonable
Based on price overall it is very good for family and friends
Place is very small, so don't think for ambience."
5,"Stumbling upon this hidden gem in the bylanes of South Mumbai was a delightful surprise. The small outlet, offering excellent non-veg and seafood, is a testament to the joy of discovering quaint places that serve value-for-money food. The restaurant is well-maintained, creating a cozy atmosphere, and the owner, a courteous person, greeted us with a warm smile.

Opting for the Surmai Fish Thali and Chicken Tikka, we were pleased to find the food not only good in taste but also served hot and presented well. The service was excellent, and the staff's hospitality added to the overall positive experience. I'm already looking forward to another visit to explore more delicacies from their menu. This hidden treasure is a definite recommendation for those seeking a satisfying culinary adventure near Marine Lines station."
2,"Update: Once this used to be my Go To Restaurant but lately the quality has gone down the gutter. Except some Kebab items, the rest of the curry food items are just too badly cooked. Bland & tasteless and never order Biriyani from here, it's just rice mixed with chicken (that's what they call Biriyani). I'm sad to see the quality drop like this hope they improve their service soon or they'll soon lose customers rapidly."
1,"Ordered surmai thali and pomfret tawa fry, both fish were stale and under cooked. They tried to cover it up by deep frying surmai and addding extra masala to Pompfret. Didn‚Äôt eat the fish as we are afraid of food poisoning.
Update: ended up with bad stomach and loose m**tions. üíÄüôè"
5,"The food at the hotel was absolutely outstanding and truly exceeded my expectations. Every meal was a delightful experience, with dishes that were not only delicious but also beautifully presented. The variety offered on the menu catered to a wide range of tastes. Each dish was made with fresh, high-quality ingredients, and the flavours were perfectly balanced. The chefs clearly take great pride in their craft, as every bite reflected skill and attention to detail. I appreciated the room service was prompt, and the food arrived hot and well-packaged. Portions were generous and more than fulfilling. The dining area was spotless and well-maintained, ensuring a pleasant experience each time. The staff were courteous, knowledgeable about the menu, and eager to accommodate special requests. I also enjoyed the themed dinner nights, which added variety and a festive atmosphere and the live singer was truly amazing applause to him. Overall, the hotel‚Äôs culinary service was exceptional and greatly enhanced my stay."
1,"Worst!!!
I was recently passing through the restaurant on 8th march, and wanted to go urgent for the washroom they denied to use it!
Even hotel taj has no rights to deny to use washrooms and this hotel they have such boards out side the restaurant, i would never prefer, recommend or suggest!!
Who ever from the restaurant goes through the review pls make sure to avoid such rules and regulations!
Avoid such places who have such rules."
5,Dropped in for primarily a couple of beers before the MI v CSK IPL game and couldn't have been made to feel more welcome. Shared a curry with my wife at the staffs recommendation and it was very good. Thanks for great experience team
3,"I've been coming to this place a few times over the last few years.
The starter was good however when it came to the main course I specifically asked for a chicken dish with only breast pieces and I was reasaured that would be the case.  Well it wasn't,  it was legs and thigh. I did complain but the just apologise. Extremely disappointed after categorically expressing my requirements.
Probably won't return again."
5,"Well maintained Restaurant and Bar near CSMT railway station (approximately 1km walking distance).

Good services with good quality foods. Beautiful ambience.

You can spend a good time with some good drinks and food. Price are goods as compared to it's location and services. For family, friends and couples are suitable for this place."
4,"Only tried their kebabs as we were already full so can't say much about the food but the kebabs we had were definitely delicious, it was on their today's special menu. This place would give you old city vibes."
5,Tried Their Special Signature Dish. Was Yummy.. Slightly High On The Cost But Ok If Not For Everytime Visits. Quantity Is OK. Could Be Better.. Less Quantity & Cost.. Not Really Appealing.  Only Draw Back Is Stewards Keep Staring At The Guests... Not A Positive Vibe....
5,"My friend was starving (not exactly starving, but craving for Chicken I should say ratherüòú) and we ended up here at Cafe Metro by chance. We walked in, not sure what to order and asked the staff about their speciality.
They suggested to go with BANJARA KEBAB!

Before I could say anything, my ‡§≠‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§ï‡§° (foodie) friend finalized the order and nothing I could do but stare at my friend with zero expression.
And boy, I am glad that the order turned out to be great!
The Kebab was insane! Soft, juicy and full of flavor.
The mint chutney added more savour to the meal.
It was like a party in my mouth!

I love when accidents turn into amazing experiences and Cafe Metro is one such!
Friendly staff, cozy vibe; overall a great experience..‚úåÔ∏èüòç

4,"This Domino‚Äôs outlet has a small seating area with air conditioning, but parking around here can be a challenge.

The Margherita pizza, though simple, is a classic and tastes great. The Peppy Paneer pizza is another flavorful option. Other pizzas worth trying include the Farmhouse, Veg Extravaganza, and Indi Tandoori Paneer.

If you‚Äôre looking for something beyond pizzas, don‚Äôt miss the Choco Lava Cake, Burger Pizza, Taco Mexicana, Potato Cheese Shots, and Zingy Parcel. For Jain options, the Zingy Parcel and Cheesy Pizza are the only two items served at some Domino‚Äôs outlets."
1,I placed the order at 12.26pm till now the order has not reached me! The app gave one mobile number and one landline number of the store and one is switched off and the other does not exist! I am trying to call customer care once got connected and later that nothing just useless!! No accountability nothing!! I would want an answer for this.. else will take up matters legally‚Äô
1,"Place is very dirty and not cleaned
No person available to take orders.
All lazy staff. There no option for zero star."
4,"The food was good. We had a Veg Loaded Pizza, two other pizzas, and Garlic Bread with cheese. We ordered through the app for dine-in while on our way to Domino's. We applied coupon codes that gave us a huge discount, so all three pizzas and the garlic bread cost just 345 rupees.

The ambiance was small but nice. When we arrived, the app showed that our order was ready, so we went to the counter. However, the staff member there told us to sit and that they would bring the food to our table.

After waiting for a few minutes, we returned to the counter and were scolded by the same staff member, who claimed he had called our order number 3-4 times. We didn't hear him and were waiting for the food to be brought to our table as he had initially said.

Despite the good food and ambiance, his behavior was quite rude."
1,"Serious Concern About Food Safety at Domino‚Äôs

I recently had a very disappointing experience at Domino‚Äôs. Vegetarian and non-vegetarian items were being handled and served together.
‚Ä¢	The same ingredients were being used in both veg and non-veg items.
‚Ä¢	Same utensils and tools were used for preparation and serving.
‚Ä¢	There was no proper separation of veg and non-veg food.

As a vegetarian, this is extremely upsetting and unacceptable. This is not just poor service, it is a violation of food ethics and trust.

I urge @dominos_india to take this matter seriously.

5,"I recently visited Mao Restaurant and had an incredible dining experience! I ordered the Chicken Noorani Kabab and Chicken Tikka Mini Kepsa, and I must say, the kababs were absolutely delicious. They had a delightful tandoori coating, and the filling was made of perfectly spiced seekh chicken. The spice level was just right‚Äîmedium spicy, which added to the overall flavor without overwhelming the palate.

What made it even more special was that it was served on a sizzling plate, enhancing the presentation and aroma. The Chicken Tikka Mini Kepsa was a unique addition to the menu, and being the first place to serve it definitely earned them some extra points. The taste was simply amazing, and each bite was a burst of flavor.

I would highly recommend Mao Restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal. The combination of delicious food, unique offerings, and excellent presentation makes it a must-visit spot. Can't wait to go back and try more dishes!"
4,"We had gone to Marines Side, and my three friends suggested that we go somewhere to eat. The big question arose: where to go to eat? Then I remembered Mao Restaurant. I had been there 7/8 years ago at kalbadevi side. So, we went there this time too. The taste is great, and we had kepsa, which is the best there. They suggested that four people should take half, so we took half and ordered one starter. Our stomachs were full. However, the washroom in the AC section is bad. Please fix it."
5,"Amazing food and the price is the best part on his can the hotel afford such a good food for normal
Prices . very courteous staff can be a bit difficult to get the seats at peak hours but must visit"
5,They serve one of the best kepsa. Also the kababs are a must try. The MAO special Kepsa is best.
2,"Definitely overrated. Had chicken kepsa, it was cold and tasted average."
1,"One of the oldest and worst maintained Monginis outlets. Whenever, I visit this place at different times, it's closed half of the time - the shop is open but it's glass doors are locked with no one inside. Seen so many customers turning away from those locked doors. It's a strange outlet indeed!"
3,Only eggless cakes available here. Staff is good 1/2 kg will cost around 370. Black forest recommended.
1,"Female staff and awesome service. Employees do not know how to talk to customers and how to behave. The staff behaved extremely badly. If you have a problem with the employee's behavior, the boss will take the employee's side instead of listening‚Ä¶ and the cake will not taste good"
4,The cakes are outstanding there is no benefit of doubt in it but I personally did not like the service today... My other visits to monginis were great but today the service was not something I would appreciate.. the star which I deducted was just because of the service
1,Very unhygienic staff when there to buy some snacks staff puts his hands in the paper bags where the snacks are put and scratches his head n all and again puts his hand to pick up samosa
5,The Kitchen is a business that supplies food to institutions and does bulk catering. They are known for their hygiene and the food is very healthy.
5,"Excellent food service

The kitchen
Best hospitality services"
5,The best food & quality available here I love it & most important is service is to good
5,Good food and ambience
5,Good
3,"We went as a group for a dinner buffet and service was a little slow but yeah they tried. Starters were very nice, we all enjoyed veg as well as non veg. Veg lasagne was great..all other veg items were also good. But the fish was not at all worth it, the chicken was also cold. Overall I can recommend it for a veg buffet but not for non veg. Dessert was all good"
2,"Not worth the price you pay or the hype.This was on my list for long but it turned out to be an okeish restaurant which can be skipped .
We ordered 3 course meals in dinner for a family of four
1)Chicken sampler was good but too salty for my liking
2) Galouti was brilliant indeed and this was the saving grace

3) Naan and biryani were also mediocRe.

Now Starts the issues

1) Ordered prawns tawa fry and they were stale and were smelling bad had to return it, and they took it back too.

2)Service was very slow and poor.Mind it the restaurant was not full and still the service was absymal at best.

3)I can understand a waiting time of 15-20 mins since food is being cooked.But we had to wait 30 mins for the chocolate sampler which was just two pastries and one tart and was simply mediocre.The pastries were dry and not at all good it was as if someone has bought the pastries from a roadside cycle hawker and served it here.This came after reminding and waiting for 20+ mins

4) 10 mins waiting for finger bowl and this when only 4 tables were being attended to including ours.

5) The food that we asked to pack never arrived on our table don't know why.

6) There is no discount on mutton dishes which is not mentioned while booking on the apps so they made two different Bills fail to understand this too as this happened for the first time with me .

All in all an experience not worth remembering.Better to avoid it since  at that price point( prices are very high considering the experience)far better options are available nearby only where in the food and service both are great.

I in my humble opinion will not be visiting for 2nd time for sure."
4,"Jan 1 - 2025 lunch - a-la-carte
Food - 5/5 tasty apps and main course
Service - our server Ninad was perfect - gave great suggestions and ensured our food was delivered hot, tasty & fresh
Atmosphere - restaurant was busy for lunch service - buffet was another option
We will be back !"

The Grilled Bratwurst Sausages with caramelized onions were absolutely to die for‚Äîperfectly cooked and bursting with flavor. The cocktails were spot on, and a big kudos to the bartender for the perfect blends.

Perfect for a cozy evening."
4,"Spanish Affair @TheLeela, Mumbai

Leela at Bombay is near the airport road and known to host businessmen. The property's grandeur and usage of plantations to make it a destination for peace in this bustling city.

When I first read, Spanish food caught my eyes and I thought I had to try it.

We had an evening of wine from Torres and Spanish food by the poolside at Six Degrees.

How was the ambience?
It was a pretty evening with wines flowing, prawns cooking while the sound of fountains soothed & the sight of the poolside pleased

What did you do?

For vegetarians, we had spinach croquet which was smooth and potato paella . Also, we had mushroom paella. Not to forget the Spanish tradition of having many olives in your meal.

Would add, it was heavenly for non vegetarians with Serrano Ham and pequilo peppers and many others flowing. I didn't try it but my friends who had this said this.

We had a cold soup viz Ajio blanc shooters which was weirdly nice. It was really different but tasted good.

Coming to the wine,
Tasted the Rose : De Caste which was good in its own way.

Then next up, I have hogged onto the desserts.

Aroz con leche : This was served in a pretty looking jar but didn't taste great.
Creme catalana : This was delectable.

Polvorones almond cookies : These cookies were soft and crunchy and just nice.
We also tried the Churros. They were made at the time of serving. Chose chocolate and strawberries to go with as the strawberries balanced out the sweetness.
There were pretzels and macaroons too. And not to forget the orange sponge cake which is again a Spanish authenticity.

Ended it with,  the chocolate flan.

My Spanish affair ended on a sweet note.
If you are fond of it, go and try it out!"
4,"The Leela Mumbai is taking its patrons on a culinary journey to Spain and is leaving no stone unturned. Celebrating the flavours of Spain, The Leela has collaborated with Chef Sergio Millet, Executive Chef of Mas Rabell restaurant at the famous Torres vineyards in Spain.

To add to the treat, The House of Torres is pairing with the menu some of its legendary wines ( Mas La Plana, Ibericos Rioja, Gran Coronas, Grans Muralles). What stuck with us the most about the wines, apart from the gorgeous flavours, was that each of them has a wonderful story to tell each explained to us passionately by Tushar.

We had the pleasure to attend one of their Tapas evenings and here
are some things that stood out :

Ajo Blanco
We were quite happy to see this popular cold soup as a starter, especially served as shots! Ajo Blanco is typically made from a mix of bread, almonds, vinegar, olive oil, salt, water and garlic. The drink is very smooth & is quite refreshing, especially in the summer.

Gambas Pil Pil
The Gambas ( Shrimp ) Pil Pil ( Sauce ) were flying off the stove like hot cakes! Almost everyone took seconds & thirds. Gambas Pil Pil Prawn tossed in a sizzling hot sauce of garlic, chilli & olive oil. Not only was it a delight to watch the chef toss them on the live counter but it was also plated adorably in these tiny little red pots.

Pan con Tomate with Spicy Tomato Sauce
Many say this dish is as humble as tapas can get. The tiny, bite-sized pieces of Spanish toast are a delicious, quick snack made with just five ingredients, namely, bread, tomato, olive oil, garlic, and salt.

Chicken and Mushroom Paella
We kind of missed this but the others were raving about this dish!

These were just the tip of the iceberg, you must visit to learn more
about the other delicacies on the menu.

Desserts
For the most part of the evening, we were hovering around the dessert counter drooling over the desserts on display.

Churros
We loved watching the churros being made and gulping them down nice and warm. To add to the delicious brown pastry, we had chocolate sauce, strawberry sauce & Ice cream made in the Leela Kitchen.

Cr√®me Catalana
The dessert draws parallels with the cr√®me br√ªl√©e, the difference being the latter doesn‚Äôt contain fine cornflour. The custard was well set and was garnished with fresh fruit, we quite enjoyed it.

Arroz con Leche
Presentation-wise, this stood out the most as it was served in these tiny dessert jars with a dropper full of syrup. The Arroz ( Rice ) con Leche ( Milk ) is basically a Mexican rice pudding and can be a bit bland. Chef Rachna gave it a little extra flavour by adding in some fresh fruits.

There were also Alfajores, Polvorones Almond Cookies, Pretzel Pops, Macaroons, Orange Sponge Cake and more!

Our brief visit to the Leela Mumbai Tapas Evening was definitely not enough for us. We will be visiting again soon."
4,"I liked this place and the ambiente to rewind and to relax in the evening. If you're happy you manage to catch the Happy Hour. The staff is very attentive and friendly.

What I learned new was, that a ""Pint"" in India means just ca. 0.33 l, what's much smaller than a ""Pint"" in the rest of His Majesty's Commonwealth. üòâ"
4,"Located inside The Lalit near Mumbai International Airport. Pricey menu with limited beer selection. Blaring music even when empty. The bar is sleepy and sad, fixtures & furniture are jaded. It needs to change."
5,"Nice place! Service can be better. If you stay in a suite, drinks and food are complimentary. As soon as you say this, the staff will not bring you the food for next 1 hour. And that too cold! Sad it was. But after talking to the chef, they took care! So will give a thumbs up now!"
5,"Beluga is a bar located in the Lalit  Mumbai.
The ambience of this place is so very apt for watching any match, be it ipl or football or world cup.
The sitting of this place is pretty comfortable.
They have wide variety of drinks with nibbles and starters to go with it.
The veg and nonveg both starters were very good.
The service was up to the mark.
Lalit standards are anyways of that high class.
Will visit again for sure."

5,"I recently visited The Beluga Bar at The Lalit, Mumbai, and it was an incredible experience! The food was absolutely delicious, and as a cricket fan, the live IPL screening made it even better. The vibrant atmosphere and friendly staff added to the overall excitement. If you're an IPL enthusiast, this place is a must-visit. Highly recommended!"
4,"We ordered

Veg kolhapuri 4/5
Chicken bhurashi tikka 4.5/5
Rawas tandoori 4.5/5
King prawn kalimiri korma 3.5/5

I felt cheated with the king prawn kalimiri korma since we were charged for king prawn 8 pieces but actually got medium prawn 12 pieces which cost lower.  They did give free juice to my kid though.

Despite the earlier mistake the service is attentive, at times too much though. I prefer service that doesn't make themselves obvious as that interrupts and distracts from the family time (but that's just me).

The 18% GST continues to be disappointing but this is nonetheless one of the few top restaurants out there.

Also, we have ordered their subj khada masala in the past, since they changed their chef they have lost touch in making this dish (like too many beans, or mushy veggies). Their pad thai is very good too. So is their tom kha ga soup and hakka starter."
5,"Navya has always been my Go-To when I go out for a Meal with my Family, Friends or if I‚Äôve got to treat  my Client. Be it North Indian, Mangalorean, Oriental, they‚Äôve serve it all. Whether, it‚Äôs their Cheese Corn Balls, Paneer Hilltop, Tandoori Fish Tikka, Everything is Soo Delicious & Flavourpacked. They even serve Some Amazing Mocktails & Cocktails which is Exclusively at a Buy 2 Get 1 FREE. In Mains we enjoyed their Green Thai Curry & they‚Äôve Multiple North Indian & Manglorean Options as well. For a Sweet Ending, We devoured the Originals such as  a Walnut Brownie, Caramel Custard & Malai Kulfi. Y‚Äôall must check out üìçNavya soon at The Regale by Tunga in Andheri East."
5,"Navya Restaurant is a must-visit! The food is delicious, and the cocktails and mocktails are a highlight - be sure to try them! My personal favorite is the mouthwatering Cheese Garlic Bread, which is the softest and cheesiest I've ever had. The ambiance is peaceful, and our waiter, Vincent, provided exceptional hospitality."
5,"Visited with my wife. It was a sudden decision and we just decided to go to this wonderful place.
Courteous, polite staff. Very professional.
We ordered an Oriental Starter, Ghee Roast Chicken and Spicy Malaysian Veg Noodles.
Great quality, awesome taste and well presented food.
The service took a little more time but it was worth the wait. Reasonable prices too. Must visit for any good food lover."
4,"I had been to the Navya Restaurant in the Tunga Hotel to celebrate my friends birthday. We had some Chinese food & also did a small cake cutting at the restaurant. The Food was delicious, but the service was ok kind. The ambience is too good for family atmosphere

5,"""I recently dined at Dakshin Coastal and had an exceptional experience! The food was outstanding, with each dish expertly prepared and presented. The service was top-notch, with friendly and attentive staff ensuring our every need was met.

The atmosphere was warm and inviting, with a cozy ambiance that made us feel right at home. The decor was modern and sleek, with comfortable seating and ample space.

Overall, I highly recommend Dakshin Coastal to anyone seeking a memorable dining experience. The combination of delicious food, excellent service, and welcoming atmosphere makes it a must-visit destination.

Rating: 5/5 stars

Price: Moderate

Recommended for: Special occasion."
5,"The place was AMAZING!!! amazing atmosphere and great service. the flavours in each dish were perfectly balanced and the ingredients tasted incredibly fresh the steak was cooked to perfection!
The service was too good and the staff was very nice."
5,", I enjoy a cozy and inviting atmosphere with soft lighting and elegant d√©cor. The restaurant specializes in Italian cuisine, offering a wide variety of classic dishes with a modern twist.

When I look at the menu, I find a good balance of appetizers, pastas, pizzas, and desserts, with prices that are reasonable for the quality. The truffle mushroom risotto stands out as a must-try dish.

When the food arrives, it is beautifully presented and full of rich flavors. The portions are generous without being overwhelming. The tiramisu is the perfect way to end the meal, light and creamy with just the right sweetness.

When it comes to service, the staff is attentive, friendly, and quick to respond to any requests. They create a relaxed yet professional dining experience.

When I choose a place for a special night out, The Golden Spoon Bistro always comes to mind. It offers excellent food, great service, and a warm ambiance. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an unforgettable dining experience.

1,I had ordered a chicken Mangolian pot rice from the restaurant and i after eating half i see a cockroach in the food and as i know the owner he tells me it wont happen next time just let this issue go. WILL SUGGEST YOU NEVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE.

5,"It was lovely place, accomodated in a small space. With AC service, soft music in background, staff also fine.

Tried Veg. Paneer spring roll, it was lovely had a wonderful tasty schezwan sauce."
4,The place is a bit difficult to identify from the roadside. You won't find the seats completely occupied all the time since much of the food goes for delivery orders. The food service is a bit slow but worth the wait. Almost every item I have tried here each time I have been here was up to the mark and delicious. The quantity is also more than sufficient and won't disappoint you by any means. Overall it's a highly recommend place if you happen to stay in the locality and crave for typical Indo-Chinese food to satisfy your hunger.
1,I had chicken pot rice not worth the price. It was tasteless and chicken pieces were very less the taste was like boiled chicken and rice I would never recommend this dish
2,"Gopal Krishna is a casual, vegetarian restaurant that serves Indian smacks. It's known for its affordable prices, but food quality, and service was so bad. The restaurant was very dirty and the staff was serving and preparing food unhygienically. I won't recommend this place, yes it's cheap but at the same price you will find better food and good service."
1,The taste of food is not good previously we had ordered hongkong fried rice ordering from here since 20 years the rice comes different this time when we ordered they gave us wrong order but saying no this is only hongkong fried rice they serve ..I am attaching image too original old hongkong is orange in colour whole what intook today is yellow tasteless rice.. there chefs are pathetic cooker
3,"I ordered mushroom kadai and mix vegetable as take away but both looked so similar and taste was also similar. The one on your right is mixed veg. and left is mushroom kadai.I was disappointed because I went for a change after frequent visits to Saidev hotel, Gurudaya ( now Shabari), Jyoti veg restaurant etc."
4,"Good veg restaurant located near Chakala metro station.I had ordered tomato onion Utappa and Pavbhaji.Uttappa was loaded and crispy.Pavbhaji was very good in taste soft butter laden paav and good tasty bhaaji living up to Mumbai standard of Pavbhaji.
Could have rated 5* but hygiene is something that needs to be improved.
There are two sections the ac section has good seating."
5,"Very good veg restaurant with variety of veg options, good service and atmosphere ,
Had veg biryani and veg Manchurian a good taste and quantity"
5,"Bought Jalebi, Fafda and Sev Khamani from here in large quantities for a wedding. It was worth the price. They made it fresh in the morning as per the request last moment. Good quality food and no compromise on the quantity."
1,Worst service provider have got snacks items twice from there once dry fruits kachori which was infested with moulds and next was samosa which was tasteless and with less stuffing even the staff working over there stays unhygienically with long and black nails and mouth stuffed with tobacco
5,"Good taste and variety of sweets,
Kesariya lassi and vada pav amazing, staff and owner very courteous.."
3,Bought Mewa Bite from this shop for the New Year Eve 2025 not good as per the hr taste and combinations they were having. Disappointed with the same. Highly overpriced Sweets but quality is not matched with Price tag.
3,"It's on the station road area, options available for fast food/snacks like samosa, jalebi, Vada pav, chaat etc.

They work on the token system basis you have to pay first and get the token then you can go to the counter for the snack. I have tried almost everything here and did not find anything fascinating that I want anyone specially to try but yes Samosa is really good made in ghee same with the Jalebi. For kachori I will recommend you to try at the shop because if you are taking a parcel it will not be worth it."
3,"Sharing my experience over food quality, service, pricing and hospitality.

Food Quality:
We had ordered Veg as well as non veg dishes. Both types of food was great in taste. The quality of food is optimum and it tastes best too. So, 5 on 5 for food quality and quantity.

Service:
I felt that the service is very poor as compared to other restaurants or hotels. When we entered, nobody was bothered to ask us water or serve until we called them. Their staff we sitting and chilling but not attending. Then one guy approached us and took order. But repeatedly we had to say them. So, service is very poor. 1 out of 5 for that.

Pricing:
Hmm.. This part is little bit balanced as well as unbalanced. We had Veg Fried rice, Paneer Chilly, Chicken Chilly and Chicken fried rice but the pricing of vegetarian dishes were very high as compared to non vegetarian dishes. This confused us too but that's what they have. But quality was best so we didn't compromised with money.

Hospitality:
As earlier mentioned, their service is not applaudable. Similarly, they irritated us by asking same question ""Aur kuch order, sir?"" again and again. They didn't ask or gave us glass of water but for more order they asked repeatedly. This was very annoying. Still, good place to have a quick bite.

So guys, if you're planning to be here, make sure you have enough money to spend.

Thanks for reading. :)"
5,"My first memory of Chinese fast food! What is my review you ask? As The Rock said, ""IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE REVIEW SAYS!"" Just come and experience good soul food yourself!"
2,The service over the years have fallen along with the taste of food items. They have also stopped serving Fried Noddles before the main dishes are served. Only visit if you are unable to access any other better place in the locality.
5,"My go to restaurant for Chinese. The taste has been the same since the past 25 years!
Many people who have tasted this at work say it beats all the other big brands hands down!!"
5,"Iconic & nostalgic. Used to eat here 10 years back when I started by career & was struggling to get a foothold.
Came back now to find nothing has changed - the decrepit ambience, the tasty food, the uninterested waiters. Just amazing"
2,"I visited Regency Restaurant with my childhood friends for dinner. While the food was decent, the waiter who took orders was quite rude. This is unexpected in a place like Mumbai where people are thorough professionals. He almost started scoffing at us with his broken English because we were talking to each other while giving orders !!! He even boasted that all the menu was created by him and had a lot of regular visitors. He kept hovering around us and intruding in between. Moreover, they seemed to be in a hurry to let us go although the restaurant was not even half filled. Overall a poor experience."
3,"Yesterday we had gone, veg food was excellent. Nonveg food - soup n starters were good. Main course - as we had placed an order for butter chicken was unbelievably pathetic. After mentioning when he got the next butter chicken that was all the more pathetic.
I guess this place is known for soup, starters n drinks main course is just about okay. Then we might as well place an order in this case. Very sad experience."
5,Beautifully designed and great ambience very hygienic and very welcoming staff and food was amazing
4,"Not a best place for vegan's, lesser variety in vegetarian food. Best for non-vegetarian's seafood is served fresh here n also drinks r offered."
5,Good service and food I ...like it

5,"During my recent visit to Mumbai, I had the pleasure of dining at sudarshan pure veg Restaurant, located at Sakinaka Junction on Andheri Kurla Road. Established in 1985, this restaurant has built a reputation for its delectable North and south Indian veg cuisine.

Upon entering, I was welcomed into a comfortable and inviting ambiance. The indoor seating was well-appointed, and I noticed they also offer wheelchair accessibility, making it convenient for all guests.

The menu was extensive, but I decided To accompany my meal, I ordered veg thali.

The staff provided prompt and attentive service, ensuring that my dining experience was enjoyable. Their courteous demeanor added to the overall positive impression of the restaurant.

In terms of pricing, the average cost for two people is approximately or less than ‚Çπ500 to 600. Given the quality of food and service, I found this to be reasonable.

Overall, my experience at sudarshan Restaurant was delightful. The combination of delicious food, pleasant ambiance, and excellent service makes it a place I would highly recommend to anyone visiting Mumbai."
4,"Great Food and Service, but Room for Improvement in Seating and Cleanliness

Sudarshan Restaurant is located in a congested area, but its food quality, quantity, flavor, and the attentive service from the staff make it worth the cost. The cleanliness could be improved, and the seating arrangement could be more comfortable, as a table meant for four people only accommodates two comfortably. Despite these minor drawbacks, the overall dining experience is highly satisfying."
4,"Our order included idli wada served with dip sambhar and a dosa. We found the sambhar to have an authentic taste and appreciated the good quality of the drumstick. The food in general was of good quality and tasted great. The Irani tea leaned towards a more watery consistency with less milk. The restaurant environment was clean and pleasantly air-conditioned, contributing to a positive overall experience."
1,"I m confused its biryani or pulav ??? Taste less ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î if u r veg biryani lover please do not visit this place. Chole bhature is worst in taste like i order sweet chole.
Very bad experience"
5,"The staff are friendly and serve you with a smile.
The food is excellent and very tasty.
A good place to come and have your meals. Located right on the Sakinaka junction."
2,"Nothing special but just a normal Subway. By the way, here does not carrying any warm drinks. Relatively not busy except for lunch peak time so, do not need to cue up. That is the good point for this shop."
5,"Order myself a paneer tikka sub and i have no idea who made it but damn!!! It was excellent. It tasted so delicious with the right amount of sauces. 5/5 for that person who made it. I have ordered subs before as well from the same place they weren‚Äôt up to the mark but as i m happy 5/5 for this time.

Make sure you‚Äôll put the sauces evenly cause most of the time the inner most part of the bread has only lettuce with no sauces at all. I understand some folks might ask you to put all sauces that is when if you‚Äôll do kanjusi its okay but if its just 2-3 sauces  thn please put generous amount of sauces."
1,"I HAD ORDERED THROUGH ZOMATO YESTERDAY AROUND 12.30 AM , I HAD ORDERED 2 WRAPS BUT I HAD RECEIVED ONLY ONE AND EVEN THE NUMBER WHICH THEY HAVE PROVIDED IS OFFLINE , NEVER ORDER FROM THIS STORE FROM ANY ONLINE PLATFORM"
1,"Never choose this outlet for Ordering Online through Zomato or Swiggy, Bread is not given as promised, Cheese was completely from all the 4 Subways that I ordered, Sauces where not put in as I had Orderd.. Even after sharing photos which I have attached here with & the Outlet they are not accepting their mistake... Very Bad EXPERIENCE with this outlet for Takeaway's.. even for dine experience the staff is very rude and Manner less"
4,They serve really good salads and sub.  Their salads and egg sub are my favourite
3,This place needs some serious looking after from the corporate team. Walls and ceilings are damp. Water leaks from the AC. Furniture looks like it hasn't been cleaned in ages. Food is below average. Their chicken grilled sandwich was a very sad sight. Washroom fixtures were broken.
1,"I always prefer CCD over any other coffee outlet, but today I visited this ccd for the first time. It was disappointing. The reception guy taking orders was very rude totally unexpected."
1,"There are 4 different menu sheets! With overlapping items.. Go find the drink you are looking for. Found it? Huh, we don't have this and this and that and that.. stop.. what do you have. Sir, just this and that!! Sir, the AC is working, so the WiFi won't.. it's odd-even mechanism at CCD. Btw, they have renovated the interiors just some time back, so if you are there just to chillax, you can come here."
5,"Highly recommended.
Perfect ambience to either get your laptop to catch up on work, bring your bae for long talks or maybe sit back and relax

Not a big CCD person, but this place gave me the cozy environment which makes the experience totally worth.

Good food, great service, well maintained space and facilities including clean washrooms and functional charger points.

Will definitely visit again.."
4,"Very delicious food at reasonable prices. The ambience is moderate but service is good. Quantity, quality and taste is simply awesome.

We had Murg musalam, egg biryani, lahsooni paneer and roti.

If you are looking for tasty food at a reasonable price do stop by.

Recommended to go here with friends, family, colleagues ‚úå"
4,"Simply good food at that price rates.
Good for quick lunch or dinner. Usually have men's crowd.
Not a place where you can go with the dinner date or to spend some good time with your spouse and family.

But good for those who wants to have quick food and alone"
5,Great food at reasonable prices. Ambience is moderate but food is delicious and service is quite good.
5,"Nice food and with affordable cost
Though place is small service is very good"
3,Service is very poor here for non drinkers. Also ambience is not that great as lights are very dim. Their customer service is pathetic.
4,"Spriti Restro Bar offers a fantastic vibe with great food, refreshing drinks, and excellent service. The ambiance is perfect for a night out with friends or a relaxed dinner. Highly recommended for a fun and satisfying dining experience"
5,Very nice and cozy place enjoy üç∫ your beer after long day at office. Service is very good and staff is friendly. Anna‚Äôs hospital is very good. Finger food options are very good (stuff cheese garlic naan is personal favourite) ‚Ä¶ cheese chaska is specialty of this place. Must try place
1,"""I asked the liquor counter person for assistance, but he refused because he was busy watching reels. I don‚Äôt understand why people like this work in this industry if they don‚Äôt want to serve customers.

Don‚Äôt put up a bar sign if you don‚Äôt actually want to sell anything. I hope the owner sees this review and acknowledges it, as it‚Äôs not a system-generated complaint like others."""
4,"Pretty nice restaurant and moderately priced.
Very well known for their Chinese food. Cheese Chaska is the best seller and we really loved it.
Not much to emphasize about the ambience"
3,"Food is normal quality, lack of variety of Vegitarian options observed. (don't go with high expectations)
Did Not had much choices for Veg people.

Veg Starter has typical corn cheese ball, pudina aloo tikki. Main course had Bhindi , Cabbage with Tandoori Roti, Pulav, Dal Rice.
Desserts have types of Rasmalai only( Rasmalai, dry Tikki) , Pedha and Tiramisu.

Over all average experience.

Must go for - Ambiance , Service."
5,"Poolside Restaurant is a casual dining pool side restaurant that serves Continental, North Indian and American cuisine along with Buffet, Brunch, Desserts and Drinks.

It's located at level 1, At the Swimming Pool Area, with a comfortable dining area. We visited here to have dinner buffet.

The dinner buffet started with a fast set of starters mix of both veg and non-veg covering Indian and Chinese cuisine.

There was a huge spread of the buffet starting with salads, soups, chaat and Indian, Chinese & Italian main courses along with the yummiest desserts counter.

Overall my experience was fabulous, I love the buffet and atmosphere."
5,"Vits Andheri has only one restaurant Spice Oasis but that is no less.
I loved their dinner near the pool concept, with fountain in the centre of the hotel.
They have 2 kinds of sitting so you can select whichever.
They have buffet dinner with Indian and Chinese both dishes.
They served starters on the table with live chat counter.
Wonderful salad and dessert counters.
The price of the buffet dinner was 1200++ and the timings are 7:00pm to 11:00pm
The special thing this time was ipl live screening.
Also IPL Theme Aesthetic decor was the unique thing.
I really loved the overall feel."
5,"Buffet is not a meal. It's an experience with loved ones. You just relaxed and sit one of those restaurants and have some amazing food in a meal and that too unlimited.

Poolside by Vits is definitely one of the most happening Hotspots. The best part of this dinner buffet it  includes Mocktails, Multi-cuisine food, Starters, soups, Main Course, Desserts with Live Chaat section with a total cost of INR 1200 plus taxes.

The vibe is fun and relaxed. So, it was overall great casual outing with your friends. About the food, it was actually nice. They have really a great options in buffet and honestly it was worth the penny.

Food : 5/5
Ambience : 5/5
Service: 5/5

P.S: The review is strictly depending on my personal experience."
1,"Extremely overpriced and incredibly tasteless ‚Äî by far the worst dining experience I‚Äôve ever had. The food quality was shockingly poor, especially given that prices were 6‚Äì8 times higher than average. To make matters worse, they pressured us to write a positive review on Zomato while standing right there, which was completely unacceptable."
1,"I ordered 1 burger and Fries Takeaway last month. Very Bad experience, 2 staff members only, 1 was making the orders, the other one was just talking on the phone continuously and did not bother for the order at all, after asking for my order continuously for about 5 to 6 times, I got my order after around 25 minutes and the guy was just careless. A would not recommend location for such a reputed brand."
4,"Everything is Good . Food is 5 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
And also very tasty. Hygiene is maintained very well. Expect everything the staff also behaves very well and provides you a well service. One of the major problem is they donot have tables i can understand that it's a pick up outlet but still they should have some tables so that the customers can stand and eat. Expect this everything was well maintained. Hence I am giving them a 4 star Hope so they install tables .... Dine in is not available"
5,Good place
4,"Amazing taste, quick delivery and really very affordable."
3,Cheap n clean wadaa paav ... good quality and fast service
1,"I recently had the absolute worst experience at this restaurant when I ordered butter chicken. First off, they didn‚Äôt even give me my order! Instead, I was served some mystery dish that looked nothing like butter chicken. I mean, what even was that?

To make things worse, there was no bill provided, so I had no idea what I was even charged for. I ordered one serving, and they sent me a portion that was less than half of what I expected. It was ridiculously salty too! I couldn't even finish it because it tasted so off and definitely not fresh.

Honestly, this was the worst food experience I've ever had. If you‚Äôre thinking about ordering from here, I‚Äôd seriously recommend looking elsewhere. Save your money and your taste buds from this disaster!"
4,"Oye Kiddan.

So I was very excited to review this place as it served my hearty cuisine, North Indian.
I was very keen as well as curious to taste the paranthas because I wanted to try Paranthas that can maybe beat the ones that my mom makes which is really difficult.

So well, when it comes to Vegetarian parathas I've grown up eating aloo parathas, Punjabi so ofcourse and well we eat them any time and any meal,breakfast, lunch, dinner, next day repeat prolly with leftovers.

I had an issue with service as my delivery was pretty late. They should improvise on that.
Packaging is impressive.

What I tried?

PANEER PYAAZ PARATHA

CHEESE CORN PARATHA

CHICKEN KHEEMA PARATHA

BUTTER CHICKEN PARATHA

NUTELLA PARATHA

RAJMA CHAWAL

DAL MAKHNI WITH LACCHA PARATHA

I loved the nonvegetarian parathas here as they were something I don't eat often. Kheema had peas in it.
Cheese corn was delicious too as the melted cheese was well spread across the entire paratha.
Butter chicken paratha was the best of all. I also liked how they packed butter, dahi and pickle with parathas along with 2 chutneys. Although, parathas themselves were delicious enough to not require any add-ons.

Rajma chawal and laccha parathas was basic. Like a little bland. Needs to be more spicy and more taste of ghee for the authentic Punjabi taste. So this can improve.

Pricing is decent enough, veg parathas start at Rs 90 so quite affordable."
1,"I ordered the paneer biryani, and it was very disappointing. It had a bad oil taste, with no spices. It seemed like they only used oil, rice, and 3-4 chunks of paneer to prepare it. I do not recommend this dish at all"
1,"Smelly and rotten paneer, can cause food poisoning if eaten. pathetic behaviour towards customer. Retreated rotten food delivered."
1,"My experience was really horrible with this branch of Oye Kiddan Andheri East.

I had ordered few veg dishes from this place and the food was so horrible that no one was able to eat even half of what we ordered.

Paneer Kadhai and Chole completely stale and was smelly.

Paratha and roti were undercooked. The surprising part was that it took them almost 1¬Ω hours from order to delivery and what we got was this waste (sorry for using such language in context to food but trust me it was beyond worse).

Unfortunately, there is no rating in minus hence giving a rating of 1. Trust me, given the food that was served to us this 1 is also way beyond your capabilities."
1,Talking about food it was okay okay not up to the mark. We had ordered paneer tikka which was very bad in taste spring roll was okay. I can recommend only Veg Banjara cause it was good only! Service is very late and they don't provide things together they give you chatnis and stuffs when your starter will be done! Veg biryani was also okay only! Atmosphere was good songs were nice according to our taste! If you want to visit it would be only one time visiting and never going back there!!
1,"Worst experience ever!!
First eatery we landed to, after coming to Mumbai for a short trip.
They showed us different menu, where prices were different and 25% lower than the billed amount.
Upon asking, the owner was so so rude and we forced him to take out that menu and he himself agreed that the menu was different, but he was so stubborn

Waiting period  was so so long"
5,This is one place you can close your eyes and trust all their menu items... We generally have their chaat and starts...they are must try
4,"Jyothi Pure Veg in Andheri is a great place for vegetarian food lovers. The ambience is really nice and comfortable, perfect for a relaxed meal. The service was awesome‚Äîstaff were friendly and attentive. The food was delicious, clean, and well-presented. It is a bit on the costly side, but the quality and experience make it worth it."
3,Tried out their menu for the first time...went around 7.30 pm..the waiters were too lousy and slow..had ordered for a coffee and had asked to serve the coffee first....but they got it in the end!! . The dosa was ok...the only thing that was good was the food being served warm. The management should straighten up those servers who are just chit chatting in one corner and not paying attention to the guests.
2,"They charge double for water and beverages. And also add up GST on them. When I asked the person for the reason, he stated that they have been doing this for many years.... I have posted this to the food consumption department.."
5,"I had an amazing experience at Crrave n eat! The service was quick and friendly, and the staff really went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed. The food was fresh, flavorful, and served hot. I especially loved the crispy fries and the cheesy pizza‚Äîit was definitely one of the best I‚Äôve had. The cafe had a cozy atmosphere, perfect for a quick meal or a relaxed hangout. I‚Äôll definitely be coming back again soon for another delicious meal! Highly recommend!"
4,"It was great time with friends and that combo pizza I specially like but I really don‚Äôt like that cheese toast.
As you people can look in picture.
That Cheese chilly toast were really so tasteless and only they put cheese on top of the normal bread.
Otherwise everything was better.
And last time I ordered 2 pizzas and that pizza were also so tasty üòã  and that‚Äôs why we visited this place at this time.

Again we visited nd it was wonderful experiences.
Ordered combo of Veg pizza, Fries and Veg burger with coke"
3,"Ambiance of the place is nice,
Food is standard compared to thie prices it could be better
Its a good place to spend time with a group
Service is nice"
5,"I had the pleasure of visiting Crrave n eat and it was a delightful experience from start to finish. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, with a perfect mix of cozy and modern. The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive, making me feel right at home. I ordered the plain cheese pizza,fries, Alfredo pasta & Oreo shake, it was absolutely delicious ‚Äî perfectly cooked and fresh. The attention to detail in both the food and the ambiance truly sets this caf√© apart. I highly recommend this caf√© to anyone looking for a relaxing spot to enjoy great coffee and a welcoming vibe. I'll definitely be coming back!"
5,"One of the best place for having best Mughali,North Indian and Chinese food.

Food rush is located at marol andheri East in front of Mukund Hospital.

They have an amazing food and the place is quite good they have a wide range of varities in all categories.
Staff is very codinating they were very polite towards everyone.

Highly recommended do try their chicken crispy and chicken lolipop."

Service is average."
4,"Choice Restaurant is located nearby Seven Hills Hospital, Marol Naka. It has decent seating.

The staff was quite helpful. I had the Sholey Kebab which was good in taste, has got a reddish orange texture with green tint on the topy, kinda juicy.

In mains we tried the Chicken Biryani, again it was having a good taste and is highly recommended from my side, Biryani lovers you must surely not miss this one. The preparation was on point.

Ambiance and service was good too, they have got AC and non-ac section too, casual dining style."
5,"Choice Bakers is one of the best place to have delicious and pocket friendly quick bites in Marol. The taste and quality has never been compromised. People who are looking for something good and pocket friendly at the same time should definitely give it a try. I ordered home-
‚ñ™Ô∏è Chicken Cheese Burger
‚ñ™Ô∏è Chicken Pattice
‚ñ™Ô∏è Russian cutlet
‚ñ™Ô∏è Chicken Kabab Roll
‚ñ™Ô∏è Chicken Boti Roll"
3,Ok ok type food.. Cost is normal. Car parking is very difficult. Too much traffic at the place.
1,One of the worst restaurant ever went. Staff was very rude no hygiene nothing proper. Staff behavior one of the worst ever scene. I will recommend my friend don't visit this restaurant. Worst ever seen staff

4,One of the best place for authentic North Indian cuisine. Good is tasty. Waiter are well trained and they have a quick turn around. Valet parking is available. Excellent place for family outing
2,"Ordered the buffet and in all honesty, it was just an average experience. Food was astonishingly just average, nothing great at all. Considering the price, it's actually a bit of a let down. Seating is quite low and service is abysmal. Starters are served at your table, but be ready to wait for 10-15 mins for them to bring it, more than half the time they seem to have forgotten about it totally. Plates were dirty, so were utensils, which was shocking, thankfully they replaced it promptly and also apologized. The atmosphere is probably one of the only good things here, good lighting and interior. We were a group of 10, spent 9k here (900rs for both veg and non veg buffet), if we'd  have gone for a la carte we could've probably gotten even more variation and the bill would have been cheaper too. Overall, i personally wouldn't go here again at this price point."
4,"There is a lunch buffet during the weekends. Great starters, great main course, desserts are not really good. Place and decor is pretty. This place is good for groups as well. They have a discount in the buffet price (A group of 5 pays for 4). Overall the food is good. Must try their Kashmiri Pulav. Valet parking available."
4,"Good place to hangout with friends for casual meet-ups. The food was great. There is a wide variety of options to choose from. The drinks options are also good. Must try the in house cocktails. The place has live music playing all around and there are live matches being played on screens. They have an open kitchen counter where you can see the chefs cooking the meals.

Overall I liked and would suggest to visit as well."
1,"We had booked a place for 4 at 1 pm through easy dinner.  When we entered the resturant, the AC was not on aw we were the only people in the resturant. Among other dishes, we had ordered chilly chicken dry which tasted very tangy and the chicken felt stale.  Definitely not recommended. We were planning to go to Caravan sarai next door but we already ordered alcohol"
4,"A great spot to hang out and enjoy dinner with friends or family. As the name suggests, the interiors are drenched in red, creating a vibrant and lively atmosphere. The service is impressively quick, and every dish we tried was delicious, leaving us fully satisfied. They also offer a valet parking facility, so there's no need to worry about parking. Although the washroom is located just outside the restaurant, it's close enough that it‚Äôs not an inconvenience. With its excellent food, efficient service, and convenient amenities, this is a fantastic place to unwind and enjoy a meal."
4,"I recently visited Bora Bora, Andheri.
However, I noticed that the spinach chicken dish, which I enjoyed during my previous visit, is no longer on the menu. I missed it!

Overall, I had a wonderful experience with the nice ambiance and delicious food."
5,"A great place with nice Ambience and peaceful lights, though we went on unusual timings, it was peaceful being there.
Service is good, food is nice.
Have to visit again during party hours for DJ experience ü§≠"
1,"I wish there were an option for negative ratings as this restaurant fails in basic hygiene and service standards.

The washrooms are unclean, the air conditioning doesn't work, and the staff conduct themselves unethically, often shouting.

This is the worst restaurant I have ever visited, with even local stalls maintaining better hygiene.

I would not recommend anyone to dine in or purchase from Domino‚Äôs"

Store is well Managed and staff as quick to respond.

Very small area hardly 3 seating inside dirty place to or order pizza"
3,Pizza is good but less seating arrangement. A/c is as good as not working. Its quite hot inside. In soft drinks only coke is available.

4,Ambience was good but haven't had chance to have food so can't comment on it
1,"Usually, when a restaurant is overpriced, it's because it offers a nice atmosphere; not Dinner's Lounge. The restaurant is out there after your money, all the dishes and the drinks have prices higher than the owner tries to fart and the service is horrendous. There was only 3 servers for a full restaurant and the one taking care of my order flat out forgot it. Bad place to go for anybody, not worth a dime, nothibg special about it except it's inner decoration."

5,"We had the restaurant to ourselves for most of our dinner so it was like a private dining experience!
The menu is large so it took us a while to decide but we went for a veggie kofta with nuts to share to start (Subzi Mewa Seekh) which were delicious! The pickles and poppadums were also enjoyed by us while I sipped my amazing gin cocktail with coconut water -what a delight!
We then shared nawabi kofta and the most delicious dahl of any we've eaten in India - dahl jamavar so rich and densely packed with flavour! We'll definitely be trying to recreate this taste sensation from the recipe back at home. We'd ordered naan too and struggled to finish the meal but tried hard as everything tasted so good.
It was an absolute treat of a meal to end on a high and conclude our trip to India."
5,"A luxurious dining experience - once you eat here, you can understand the almost perfect rating! Firstly, the ambience of the venue is warm and lush. The staff are so friendly, attentive and helpful - it was a pleasure just chatting to them. I had the sampling menu and trust me when I say I can eat a lot but I struggled to fit everything in. Each dish was crafted perfectly and you could observe the passion that the chefs had invested in each creation. Loved it!"

Someone in India needs to know how to serve chicken without a bunch of bones"

The staff are friendly and accommodative to  your needs/requirement. Especially the 27yr experience staff who is so customer oriented. I would give him a standing ovation for a good recommendation

The food is must try as it lovely  and especially coming from another country"
4,"First morning at the Leela hotel, it was very nice to wake up to a hearty breakfast, freshly made omelette, potato masala dosa and all. The food tasted great. Coffee was nice as well. Staff was friendly and attentive. I liked their chickpea curry and cheesy spinach omelette. Their almond croissants and coconut danishes were very delicious! All in all it was a good start of the day."
4,"Celebrating Regional Eastern Cuisine over brunch @Citrus, The Leela

Leela has always kept it simple, limited and standardised with its brunches.

We recently tried the Sunday brunch @Citrus, The Leela.
Firstly what we love about this place is the greens surrounding the restaurant visible from its long glass panes. It has a very soothing effect.
Our table was right by the mini waterfall and the lush green plants .

India has such varied cuisines that itself is a celebration. We tried their Eastern Regional themed brunch and were stunned by their delicacies.

They had picked up dishes from Himachal, Bengal, Assam and more.
We tried the following :
Thukpa soup
Bengali style vegetable soup

Laksa is a typical delicacie .
And not to forget the delicious spicy momos.
For mains we tried ,
Phed Nor Mai wok fried bamboo shoot with string
Kaow Phad Pak - vegetable fried rice .
They had great fish like sarson diya mach .
Lets talk about my favourite part. Desserts.
And oh they had sugar free Rosgulla . I absolutely had no guilt then.
They had others too :
Pithe
Nariyal ladoo
Kesar chum chim
Sondesh .

Barring this, they also had the regular
Chat
Salads
Cheese spread
Live pasta and pizza counter
And the best of all, lovely fresh popcorn popping in front of you.
They also served Hummus , Fattoush and more.

Their dessert spread was limited but good. We loved the fondue .
We also liked the innovation to the simple dishes.
We tried :
Thandai Breton
Chocolate mousse with apple cardamom compote
Pistachio crepe brulle crumble - I loved how the pistachio flavour dwelled .
Saffron baked yoghurt
Boondi baked lemon cheese cake  - I genuinely liked the way soft boondi and cheesecake went together.

Staff :
They say more than the food, what matters is the how they feed you.
The staff was genuinely so warm and fed us like we were family.
I was not well. Mr Ravi, served me some amazing black tea with ginger and honey .
Further, Ravi was recommending us some wonderful dishes to try on.
Mr Kaustabh took care of us extremely well.
Further, all the staff whose names I might have missed were warm.

Overall :
We sat there for good 3 hours enjoying the weather from inside and gorging onto delicious food.

Deets :
Every Sunday of this month is regional themed brunch.
Further , till 14th August on Dineout they do have 50% off on brunch ."
5,"This was the best food experience of my week in Mumbai! And we were lucky that the food buffet could be coupled to a Indian wine buffet for an extra fee! Wow, I will definitely go back next time I have the chance to visit Mumbai."
5,"Good variety of food . Amazing hospitality.
Must must visit if you want a grand dining ."
5,"I am unable to use Indian spicy food, so I ordered ‚ÄúKaiseki Zen‚Äù Rs2750.  It‚Äôs good choice to have healthy salad, excellent sashimi of tuna, salmon and scalop and natural wasabi.  The tempura is superb like made from a master Tokyo, and salmon taste with sweet sauce like unagi.  Miso soup with tofu and nori, the steam rice with sweet japanese curry.  Perfect! I almost forget that I am actually in Mumbai!  I thank Tushar‚Äôs service and the great cook maters.  Go-gi-so-san!"
5,I used to go to this place often since my childhood days. A lot of their dishes are tasty. The ragda pattice which is unique and an identity of the place. The pav bhaji also. Earlier they used to provide long cut onion rubbed with beetroot along with the pav bhaji. And the tawa pulao which is next level. You need to order it spicy. Adding a photo. Just a look at the tawa pulao will make you have it. Have had the tawa pulao countless of times.
5,"One must definitely have their Ragda Pattice, Pav bhaji & Vada Pav.
Also tried their Tawa Pulao and Dal Tadka. Both were tasty.
Service is quick and staff is polite.
Overall highly recommended restaurant in Dadar TT area."
1,"Worst restaurant ever, it doesn't deserve even 1 star, the food they served to us was stale and stinky. When complained the owner denied, we left the food after eating 1 bite, as we couldn't eat it."
4,"Nice little place. Specialises in Ragda-Pattice. Haven't had this style of Ragda Pattice anywhere else. A must try.

Update: Basis the owners recommendation, tried the Dhai Puri today and it was good!"
4,"Located at Dadar circle..Ambience is ok..I like having Ragda samosa here and it's really goodüòã..Pav bhaji, dal fry  and parathas are good too..."
5,"Had a great experience at Mini Punjab! The flavors were spot on. The White Chicken Tandoori stole the show‚Äîtender, creamy, and packed with subtle spices. It‚Äôs a must-try if you‚Äôre into tandoori with a twist.

The Seekh Kabab was juicy and had that perfect char and smoky flavor‚Äîclassic, but done really well.

The Murgh Bhatti Da Masala was rich, bold, and full of depth. The masala had that earthy tandoor taste which gave it an extra kick. Great with naan or rice.

Also, shoutout to the ambiance‚Äîcozy, vibrant, and perfect for a chill dinner or a small gathering. The vibe really added to the whole experience.

Rating: 4.5/5
Must-Try: White Chicken Tandoori
Would I recommend it? Definitely. Food, flavors, and feels‚Äîall in one place."
4,"Have been going to this place since childhood and had the best memories from here. Whenever I use to walk by around this place the smell of tandoori chicken, kebabs, Chinese food just used to pull me towards it.

Whenever I get chance I go with my friends just to eat tandoori items along with a chicken fried rice.

Before the hygiene never bothered me but since I have personally become a chef I can‚Äôt ignore it. But whenever I go to this place I ignore everything and just eat like a small kid.

Food is awesome taste wise and got bit expensive as compared to before but never mind. The dine in place is not suitable for families but good for group of friends.

So whenever you go must try things are white chicken, seek kebabs, tandoori chicken and fried rice. You will never go wrong with this. And if you like other parts of chicken like chicken potta (gizzard) or chicken liver then please go for it.

Thank you üôèüèΩ"
5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at The Grove, and I must say, it exceeded all of my expectations. From the moment we walked in, the ambiance was inviting and cozy, with soft lighting and an open kitchen concept that added a welcoming vibe."
5,"Very tasty food. Good quality.
Good service.
Waiters were really polite and nice."
3,"I and my family ate at Mini Punjab thrice in the last one month. Food taste is inconsistent. The first time, food was good. We found the main dish excessively salty the second time. The captain was gracious to have it replaced but we thought it did not measure up to the food served on our first visit. My third visit was on 7.4.25 and yet again we thought salt was used more generously although the food tasted good. The captain Mr. Sunil was communicative and appreciably suggestive when asked what was good there. The place appears claustrophobic and hardly provides an atmosphere. It is basic but clean. There is ample room for improvement."
4,"New Punjab Restaurant & Bar: A Mumbai Institution

New Punjab Restaurant & Bar is a well-known spot in Mumbai, loved for its authentic North Indian cuisine and lively atmosphere. It‚Äôs a great place for both locals and tourists looking to enjoy flavorful dishes in a casual setting.

Food:

‚≠ê Delicious and Flavorful: We tried the mutton biryani, chicken biryani, malai chicken, and lung fung soup, and the taste did not disappoint. The biryanis were rich in flavor with perfectly cooked rice and tender meat, while the malai chicken was creamy and well-seasoned. The lung fung soup had a comforting warmth with a well-balanced taste.

‚≠ê Wide Variety: The menu offers something for everyone, from vegetarian delights to meaty specialties. Whether you're in the mood for appetizers, main courses, or desserts, there‚Äôs plenty to choose from.

‚≠ê Good Quality & Quantity: The portion sizes are generous, and the quality of ingredients is evident in every bite. While the prices may be slightly on the higher side, the overall experience makes it worthwhile.

Ambiance:

‚≠ê Lively and Energetic: The restaurant has a buzzing atmosphere, making it a great place to dine with friends and family.

‚≠ê Casual and Cozy: It‚Äôs a casual dining spot, but it can get quite crowded, especially during peak hours.

‚≠ê Limited Seating: The space is a bit cramped, so making a reservation is recommended, especially if dining in a larger group.

Service:

‚≠ê Friendly and Efficient: The staff is attentive and welcoming, ensuring a smooth dining experience.

‚≠ê Fast Service: Despite the restaurant being busy, the service was quick, and our food arrived in a timely manner.

Overall:

New Punjab Restaurant & Bar delivers on taste, offering delicious North Indian dishes in a vibrant setting. While the seating is a bit tight and the prices slightly high, the flavorful food and quick service make it a place worth visiting. If you‚Äôre in Mumbai and craving biryani or classic North Indian dishes, this spot is a solid choice!"
5,"They served a very generous amount of portions.
Butter chicken was really good.

Value for money"
5,"Good place to be at for a quiet lunch or dinner. Do try the Schezwan chutney here, it is to die for. Staff is friendly. Only issue here will be parking."
4,"Good Place if you want to try Non-Veg, especially Chicken Tandoori, Starters & Biryani.
They also offer cocktail & mocktails along with drink options."
5,"I had the pleasure of dining at New Punjab Restaurant recently, and I can confidently say that it offers some of the best food in town, particularly their biryani dishes. The flavors were absolutely delightful, and the quality of the food was top-notch.

What stood out for me, besides the delicious food, was the welcoming atmosphere for families. It's a great place to enjoy a meal with your loved ones. Additionally, the restaurant's central location between Sion and Dadar TT makes it easily accessible.

If you're in the mood for some mouthwatering food in a family-friendly setting, I highly recommend New Punjab Restaurant. You're in for a truly delicious experience!"
1,"Icecream is good but king circle branch.. person very bad .
He couldn't credit our icecream point.. always said bad me aa jayega
He did ths frm last 5 times.. tday also he did same I called him n ask..
He told same story..
Big cheater  he credit point k lie..
I feel he took in his account"
5,"Ice cream are our all-time favourite rite? Tht too with some super innovative flavours which you never tried. Apsara ice creams, one of the oldest brands of Mumbai has some of the best flavours for you. Been to this place with my family and honestly four of us had our own choice available in this brand. Believe me its very rare.
Outlet is done very nice and they are not as small as other ice cream places. Green colour looks wow in their interiors. They got, sorbets, kulfies and ice creams with many flavours in fruit, nuts and chocolate based. You can taste taste their ice creams which will help you to choose the best one. We tried 4 flavours like motichoor laddu icecream (Special for ganapati festival), sugar free kesar pista, coffee and paan.
Motichur laddu flavour was super hit, spcial for ganapati festival had good amount of bundi in it and balanced taste of saffron and sweetness was just perfect. Must order and would request them to keep this flavour 36 days in their menu.
Paan flavour is again was one of the best. Enjoyed it.
Next time I will try their shakes and even the pani puri sorbet which I coudnt try. Yes don‚Äôt miss their guava on which they sprinkle spicy seasoning. From now onwards I would order from apsara on regular bases for sure. Thanks to the team for such a warm experience."
4,"Thankyou Apsara Ice Cream for a good experience.
Had their Brownie Blast Ice-Cream and Cookies n Cream. Both the ice-creams were good in taste.
Their ambience is nice and they also have board games, so you can have a good time at Apsara Ice Creams‚ù§Ô∏è
Overall - Nice"
4,"Apsara in Matunga is located at Matunga Circle, making it easily reachable for people.

As such small outlet but has mezzanine floor to sit as well. Has some board games to play as well.

We had spicy Guava, bubblegum, orange & coffee ice cream. I personally loved spicy guava & coffee flavor ice creams. Both are irresistible."
2,"Good variety of icecreams, unhygienic environment,flys are everywhere,there is a instruction written for workers,NET ON BEARD.
But who cares the signage,it's there to simply ignore.
Once name is built up,Apsara icecreams have now taken it for granted come what may, customers will come & go."
5,"We visited this restaurant on 31st eve and celebrated our new year over there. The ambience was decorated beautifully and had these good vibes all around.
For our meal we start it with the starters called Nawabi kumbh it was garnished so well and it had mushroom in it, roasted in masala and they divided the mushroom equally. It was cooked so well and had a unique taste, yummy though.
For main course we went Veg Hangama which was spicy and tasty. Served with roti and it had a good amount of gharam masala making it spicy.
For rice we went with triple schewan fried rice as we consumed too much of indian. The triple schewan fried rice was served with Manchurian soup. Both making a good combo together.
This restaurant is amazing and served tasty food with nice garnish dishes and is spacious as well."
4,"Well this is a local restaurant serving delicious Food. It is a vegetarian restaurant having a lot of food options in their menu.

This restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating. It is a spacious restaurant.

We had Paneer Butter Masala, Butter Roti, Tomato Soup, and Masala Papad. The food was delicious and also the service was prompt."
5,Really loved the food here. Would highly recommend the lasagna and the idli chilli. The cheese garlic bread was really good too. The ambience and hospitality is remarkable as well. 10/10 would recommend
3,"Had masala dosa and rava dosa. The taste was not that good. Rava dosa was not crispy but hard. Masala dosa was eatable though it didn‚Äôt have any particular dosa taste.

The dining area was clean but the washroom was pathetic. It was upstairs on a mezzanine floor where the floor was of 2m height and you had to bend forward all the way. Very uncomfortable."
4,"The lasagna here is amazing so would definitely recommend it. The paneer chilli too is good so it's worth trying. Also tried the hyderabadi biryani, veg crispy and hakka noodles but didn't like them much especially the hakka noodles so wouldn't recommend it. Services and ambience pretty good."
4,"Delicious lucknowi style dum biryanis. I would recommend the biryanis only, the starters and main course items are subpar. The biryani however is packed with masala and flavor."
4,Good place in Navi Mumbai for non veg lovers. You will get good quality food. We had chicken angara gravy with naan . Taste was really good. Atmosphere need to bit improve. Overall experience was nice. Tandoori seems my next time dish there... Recommend to visit for family to friends ...
3,I dinein here and order the chicken dum biriyani half in this restaurant.Food taste is ok but it's too much oil on biriyani overall atmosphere and service is good chicken taste also good . Take care about making its too oily gravy u can see on photo
4,"It's a pretty good restaurant. They have lot of varieties but I like Tandoor which they also offer as a whole chicken along with regular small pieces which other restaurant offers. They also sell biryani which has to be one of the good in the nearby locations. Another one I wanted to highlight is the rumali roti which you don't find everywhere. They deliver at home in kharghar without any extra charge. They have other punjabi dishes and Chinese food also which you may try.
Not much of a rush outside the restaurant."
1,Food quality is some where OK but Service is Third Class they don't have good staff stafs behavior is so Blunt.
2,"If you get this quantity for 300 RS Salad, it is a total disappointment. Packaging was even worst. You put entire salad dressed with sauces in cardboard box? The photo will show you how bad the food looks. Subway used to be my go to option. The only reason I have 2 star instead of 1 was the taste. The taste was good, quantity and packaging was disappointing"
1,"Disappointing Experience - Not Worth the Money

I recently visited Subway with high hopes for a satisfying meal, but unfortunately, my experience left me thoroughlyüòû. From the taste to the cost, everything fell short of my expectations.

The taste of the food was far from enjoyable. I couldn't help but feel like my money was wasted on a subpar meal that I could have easily enjoyed elsewhere.

There are plenty of other dining options available that offer better value for money üíµ. All in all, my visit to Subway was a regrettable experience. I wouldn't recommend üëé it to anyone who is looking for a satisfying and flavorful meal. There are definitely better places out there to indulge in a tasty meal without feeling like your money has gone to waste."
1,"Very disappointed
Yesterday I have ordered peri peri chicken salad and portion size was not enough for 1 person salad was very less in quantity and also sauce quality was also very very less I don‚Äôt why this kanjoosi you guys doing I don‚Äôt think to spend bucks for good food and portion but why you ppl think before make this salad to add little little everything? Is this food worth for my every single penny? Do this food justice to fulfill the stomach ?
Worst experience from this outlet I have faced never recommend to anyone never gonna order from here anymore."
1,Staff is very unhelpful especially Rupali. Veggies are not fresh. Server was very aggressive and was getting irritated and started shouting and banging things. Did not expect such behaviour in Subway.
1,"I was strictly forbidden from adding any veggies in Customisation but they added all Veggies (Onion, Tomatoes, Capsicum, etc) and the Contact Number of Subway given on zomato is Incorrect plz have look on the image Below."
1,"Very disappointed.
One of the oldest restaurants of Kharghar and they couldn't keep their taste
I tried kerala biriyani 7yrs ago (which was delicious)
And now the rice used itself is low quality with no taste
Only masala and rice.

Ambience could be more decent but is not."
2,"Food was adipowli awesome,
Service also good, rate was budget friendly.

Evening time Kerala special Paratha - freshly made live cooking we can see (video & photo attached)

Few suggestions:
‚Ä¢ don't use food colours, we tried Egg Roast, Egg Masala - All contain food color (informed to owner), taste wise good only color they're using that's the issue.

*The customer service at the hotel was disappointing, as the servers were attentive but did not meet satisfactory standards.

‚Ä¢ Using plastic plates while dining there for the main dish, curry all....
Only Kerala meals I got a stainless steel plate - currently micro plastics issues are also going so kindly try to remove plastics, and go for alternatives."
4,"The first thing you will notice about this restaurant is the quantity of food they offer at a very affordable price. As the reviewers  recommended, I ordered the food at home a few times. Taste is good. 'Kerala style Chicken Curry ' is more spicy and delicious than chicken chettinadu. 'Kerala style Chicken Chilly' is good. Tried Kuttu paratha with chicken good taste. Butter chicken was ok. The curry and gravy dishes tastes better with Malabar paratha."
3,"Good for kerla style food ..
Very much budget friendly.
Speciality: Laccha Paratha."
2,"I recently dined at Cochin Ark Restaurant and unfortunately, my experience was quite underwhelming. The food was mediocre at best. While the menu offered a variety of options, the dishes I tried lacked flavor and authenticity. The ingredients did not seem fresh, and overall, the meal was disappointing.

The atmosphere of the restaurant was quite poor. The decor felt outdated and the place lacked a welcoming ambiance. The lighting was dim, and the seating was uncomfortable, making it hard to enjoy the meal.

The service was the most disappointing aspect of my visit. The staff were inattentive and seemed uninterested in providing good service. It took a long time to get our orders taken and even longer to receive the food. When we finally got our dishes, they were not as ordered, and the staff did not seem concerned about correcting the mistakes.

Overall, my experience at Cochin Ark Restaurant was far from satisfactory. The combination of mediocre food, poor atmosphere, and lackluster service made for a disappointing dining experience. I hope the management takes these points into consideration and makes improvements for future customers"
3,"Papa Ji da Dhaba offers a good dining experience with delicious food and a cozy ambiance. Tried the Chicken Reshmi Kebab, and it was a standout‚Äîperfectly cooked, tender, and uniquely stuffed with layers of white egg on top, adding a rich texture. A great place for flavorful North Indian cuisine!"
5,"I heard they have renovated recently. Earlier it was operated in ground floor with only few seats but now they have expanded and now have 2 entire floors.
It's spacious if we compare similar hotels in new mumbai.
Starters were tasty and so was the main course. We had ordered Butter chicken which was delicious as well. Naan was soft and juicy."
5,"I visited this resturant along with my family for a birthday celebration, we was total 15 members, the restaurant food was tasty üòã, all the items which we ordered, all was good in taste and quality, after our cake cutting and dinner, we got a complementary sweet dish for each members from the restaurant owner, in short resturant is best in Food Taste, Food Quality, Service, Seating arrangement, and owner is very humble üëçüçù, they have a party hall also for birthday and other celebrations."
3,Must visit if you are craving for Punjabi food. Expect food in Punjabi taste. Has varieties of food items available. Only downside is the service is very slow. No comfortable sitting arrangements. Average ambience. Tried veg thali and papaji da dhaba combo. Loved the taste.
1,"Size of rotis and quantity is very limited also test was okay okay
I will eat unlimited Rajasthani thali which was so much testier then this also full of quality my first and last experience with papa ji da dhaba if you see and want to reply kindly consider your behavior and quality and quantity. Otherwise your restaurant will be vanish in no time."
3,"I tried thepla today and realised that the quantity is less though taste was as it should be. But more disappointing was pickle. It's a green chilli pickle with almost no salt and oil. There was absolutely no taste. To worsen it,  comes the quantity of pickle, you can't even eat one thepla. It's absolutely negligible in quantity.

Mumbai is a city where thepla is one of the main food items but I have never faced such issues with quantity or quality-quantity of chatni/pickle.

Dissappointedüëé"
5,Excellent tasty Chole Bhature quality & Quantity is worth
3,It is a small sweet shop with good options but there is scope for adding more options. The counter is close to the entrance so it becomes congested during peak hours or during festival time.
5,"Neelkanth Sweets and Namkeen serve one of the best chaats in Navi Mumbai, the special one which i would recommend is their Cheese Chola Bhatura and Paneer Cheese Paav Bhaji. They are worth it."
4,Good sweets snacks and chats available at this place. Also they have branches around Kharghar and Kamothe
1,"My experience was very bad today I purchased 3 chocolate Pastries today ,After coming home I found them very bad in test and were also Smelling Bad"
5,Ms. Sonali Mohite was very prompt and very efficient staff. She guided me well with my order. Thanks.
5,"The monginis cake shop is very nice, its products are very tasty and they are available at low prices and their service is also good, their staff is also very good."
1,"My very first visit n very disappointed...today afternoon around 3:30 pm brght a chocolava (75/-)..tht person ask me if I want to heat it.  I said ys n he did n packed tht cake from top also wit brown paper too i ws bit surprised but dint doubt.
But now after dinnr my daughter took it out n ws surprise to see tht the cake due to over heating blasted all over inside tht box..  i ws so amused tht how come tht staff still gave me tht costly pastry in such horrible condition n got it ki y he packed it from upside also"
5,Very tasty cake made by monginis.... It was v fresh and super delicious
4,"Nice place to eat with friends and family. On the main road towards Iskon temple. They have ample space outside if you want to enjoy the weather and inside if the temperature is running too hot. The food was good and served properly. The server took time to explain the options.

Kids loved the Paneer stuffings. There are lot of other eating joints also nearby. The competition ensures the quality of food and services are provided efficiently."
5,"One of the best service received at this restaurant. Food was great too. The waiters were prompt and happy to provide us extra glasses/ straws/lemons,what ever we asked. The attitude to serve is very positive and welcoming. The masala soda was top of the line and again one of the best compared to the other restaurants visited by me. Shall definitely recommend to visit the place and also will visit again when I visit to new Mumbai. Again a special thanks to the management for a pleasant experience at the restaurant üòÄ"
2,"Yesterday in dinner we ordered biryani from swiggy, expecting the quantity to be sufficient for two people, as is usually the case when dining in. However, the portion size was barely enough for one person. While your restaurant servings are generous (enough for 3+ people), the takeaway quantity does not justify the price paid.

Additionally, the raita provided was stale. My wife had just one spoon and vomited shortly after, which was extremely distressing.

I hope you address these concerns‚Äîportion consistency for dine-in vs. takeaway and food quality checks‚Äîto avoid such experiences for other customers. I expected better from your brand."
4,This is very good location and Food is undoubtedly good north indian flavour but as i went in noon there were flies around. Probably the evening outdoor sitting would fetch 5stars. Can try it out
2,"There was a huge crowd . After 40 to 50 minutes we got the place .
Service was also not good , plate was not clean.
The food tasted average ."
5,If you want to try something different than Domino's and Pizza Hut then this is the best place for you. Food quality and taste is awesome. Different types of pizzas with unique taste. Prices are also affordable. Service is good. The atmosphere is ok. Must try this place.
1,"This place was the best in terms of pure vegetarian pizza and quick bite cafe in Kharghar
Now after 10 years, it desperately needs to be renovated, with atleast a better seating and dine in experience

The sofa seats are torn off the tables are slanted, there is no water point for hand wash,
Cheap quality wall paint is so degraded it looks worst than any road side pan wala

One more pathetic thing observed,  is they have reduced the parcel bags to one paper bag that too without handle..which is stupid idea, how will anyone carry the parcel.

In a world where brands are creating good packaging for delivery, they have reduced to kirana store mindset.
Not at all acceptable by customers

As a regular visitors and customer of this outlet, I feel disgusted when staff is helpless to give a bag to carry 3-4 pizza boxes to home.
All they are giving a handle less paper bag, which is of no use. Do you expect a customer to get tote bags to carry pizza box home

The management should look into it.or else you will loose a regular loyal customer base in Kharghar."
4,"It was just a casual visit for a quick bite in the evening. We had pasta and cheese galic bread.
Pasta was average to good. 3.5/5
Garlic bread 3.5/5

I feel they have more customers for take away/food delivery as compared to dine-in.

Ambience or sitting was ok ok. AC was just for display they have fans....since it was not hot humid we did not ask for AC.

They need to work more on Exhaust. ;)"
4,This place offer a variety of snacks. The pizza is a must try as the base is really soft filled with enough toppings at a very reasonable price. They also have different pasta's and garlic bread. Do not forget to end it all with their dessert.
4,"Food here is excellent and rates are also nominal. I would suggest to have pasta, garlic bread and nachos mexican style(must try). Service is also fast. Reduced one star for their ambience and cleanliness. Flies and small insects inside dining area."
5,"The chicken kosha egg roll from this place in Navi Mumbai is my absolute favourite.
Chicken kosha, which is a bengali style chicken curry, along with an omlette is loaded into this roll and a bite of this is enough to teleport you to Bengal.
They also have a variety of vegetarian rolls too of which you can try the double mushroom roll or the paneer cheese roll.
This place in Kharghar is called Kolkata Rolls and you should definitely go here if you want to have some authentic kolkata style rolls"
4,"A small joint for some quick bite street foods of Kolkata. You can have roll, both veg and non-veg option, vegetable chop, fish fry, egg devil, chicken cutlet. They also started selling Momos and Shwarmas. If you want to have your dinner here, then Paratha and Chicken/Paneer Kosha also available. Very quick and courteous service."
1,Yesterday I  ordered chicken shawarma and egg roll but I received paneer shawarma  mix with chicken which is not acceptable Swiggy is not taking my complaint as I don‚Äôt have pictures because I ordered this for my kids and I was out so this is truly disappointing
1,The Kolkata styled biryani's quality has degraded badly.The owner is agressive and gets irritated easily. Need to learn patience while talking to customers.
1,"Worst experience for Dun Biryani. Literally the half cut potato in my bowl. One egg. And the huge piece of chicken is not even cut, and has no good taste. Dum Biryani doesn't have masala at all in it. Very dry. So disappointed."
1,This outlet is a blot on the Dominos brand. Pathetic service whether you go dine in or delivery. For delivery they often screw up orders as well. Never had a worse experience with a QSR brand since visiting and ordering from this dominos outlet. Have basically stopped ordering from dominos because of inconsistent experiences from this outlet now.
1,"I  gone to these.place but it very dir, no chairs are clean , people are taking every loud , i returned with percel i really don't wanto go there, am also a from hospitality bagroujd but it's so unhygienic to go there..... I really thought who dominos stands gone down.."
1,"You ordered Burger Pizza üçî but delivered wrap üåÆ
Complaint registered, but no result üëéüëéü§¨üò°"
5,"It is one of the Best outlet of Domino's.
Really like the ambience and staff Courtesy even patience level while taking the order.
Special thanks to Ms Darsha for helping in selection of Great Meal."
1,Customer Service is the worst. They keep directing us to bots which don‚Äôt reply. All the numbers are unavailable. They made us wait for 1.5 hours and then cancelled the order. UTTERLY CARELESS & DISAPPOINTED. Never ordering again and recomend you guys not to order too. No sign of refund. ABSURD SERVICE!!!! Unexpected from Dominos.
2,"A well known chain of shops of bakery. Taste is ok. Prices are Rs 350-400 per half kg pastry. You can get all varieties of cakes like black forest, red velvet, rasmali cake, Eggless cakes too.
You can get freshly baked puff and donuts, kadai paneer (don't worry it's a kind of puff and slightly sweet in taste)"
1,"Cake was good, but the the shopkeeper was too much rude. The owner is polite but the staff is not behaviour is rude and not polite....
If you Customize the cake they can ask us to arrange all cake decor material and charge us for the same also.
This is my 3rd experience  with same staff member."
1,Such a worst chocolava cake and brownie fudge i have ever eaten. It was tasted and dmelled like chemical. Please change the stock and please dont bake these items again. If you are baking please name them different dont fool people. Such a worst cake shop.
1,Think twice before ordering online. I ordered Rasmalai pastry heater it was stale. With 2-3 bites I'm facing stomach upset problem today. It violation of food act that you are selling stale food. If the cake are stale then don't accept the order or make it out of stock but don't sell stale pastry. Pastry was so hard despite being Rasmalai pastry. The other item I ordered Nutella pastry was comparatively fresh so I could easily see the difference.
1,Firstly they denied the cake which we would like to order. When we asked which flavour is available only 1 flavour was available and that was truffle nothing else. I would like to say I asked these details when store opened that time onwards only 1 flavor cake they have. I ask I want it for evening still said Truffle cake is there only. Still weprderand now in evening at 5pm the person denies to deliver it. And rudely says we will return your money which you paid. Such rude behavior and pathetic service received today on 19th August 2020.
2,"Unlike the first time, when the pizza was what it should be hot, spicy and delicious, for the last 2 times they are delivering cold pizza with a very bad chewy base. Seems the oven of ‚ÄúOven Story‚Äù has become freezer and story is now more like a TV soap‚Ä¶ you will get bored to finish it. I could have written this the last time as well but thought of taking one more chance to prove me wrong but alas, I am disappointed."
4,"So I ordered Pizza from their Buy 1 get 1 offer - Maharaja Veg Pizza cheese bust, Double Cheese Margherita & Cheese Stuffed Garlic Bread. The taste was good, the pizza was flavorful, and the base was soft."
5,"I visited my friend at Khargar and we had ordered the Picante Paneer Pizza.
- Boy o boy trust me it was Super Delicious.
- Loaded with those tremendous toppings, it tasted mind blowing.
- The quality and the Quantity of the pizza was great! Enough for 2 person. More amazing than expected.
- I would for sure love to eat more pizzas from the ovenstory now onwards."
4,"Ordered Corn Veggie Delight Pizza, Classic Margherita Pizza with extra paneer tikka as topping and Cheese Garlic Breads.
Honestly I didn't like the taste of these pizzas. Normal sauce, cheese and fresh toppings that's it but no taste. The only thing I liked is their Cheese Garlic Breads.
Update- This Time Veg Overload Pizza and it was tasty, cheesy and better than last pizzas with Chipotle base."
5,"The god of all the pizza is the maharaj veg pizza. Which is a perfect mixture of all the vegetable toppings  and the tandoori paneer masalas taste. The the most cheesiest pizza and the size of the pizza is beyond words. The box of white macaroni cheesy pasta with lots of cheese and amazing vegetables like olives, three variety of capsicums, jalape√±os and the sweet corn and mixed herbs the thick layer of cheese on the pasta is just beautiful and really tasty which just makes the pasta even taste more amazing really this is recommended to try worth having. The dessert with the melting chocolate is the chocolate fantasy Is just really tempting and amazing. When you just have a bite from it the chocolate just melts in your mouth and the best to try for all the chocolate lovers."

1,Fraud. I've ordered food in Swiggy today. My order was not delivered but the delivery partner mentioned in Swiggy that he delivered the order. Even Swiggy service is poor here. Kindly respond
4,"Box 8 is a very famous delivery outlet and I must say very fast in their delivery. They serve a variety of products. I wanted to order some dishes but. Not knowing the good places nearby, I turned to one of my favorites - Box 8Talways order their lunch boxes and _ they like dal makhani. The quality of the food was good

1,"Worse outlet in my life. Never had such a bad experience in any outlet,very cheap and poor customer service. Never come here in your life."
5,"It's an amazing take-away if u r craving for good desi bowls , thali and desert ...My personal fav is their paneer makhani rice box which is too good ...Some people may find it a bit pricey but it's worth the price !!!"
5,Good excellent Service
4,
1,Worst experience terrible biryani in whole kharghar pls don‚Äôt buy i ordered Hyderabadi biryani it was a veg pulao with green peas and carrot and some boiled chicken without any spice tasteless biryani ! Pls dont buy !
5,"If you are interested in ordering online Biryani for the parties, then this is best one in Kharghar. Veg Pulao and Paneer Tikka Masala Pulao is best. Chicken Biryani is also available here, although when we talk about Biryani it is always Mutton Biryani!"
1,"Save money and order from Behrouz or Charcoal or Biryani By kilo But not this one. No hygiene No manners to talk.
Worst biryani experience, they tell you something and deliver another and can't argue because staff is rude."
1,"The worst food ever. I found bone in my veg biryani.
The worst restaurant ever."
5,"Highly recommended...
Taste remain same round the year even you order on occasions when they have huge order they don't compromise on the taste...
Would recommend to order Chicken Tikka and Kabeb Briyani, one should try this both from him.

Price is much reasonable and comparatively low for the quality and taste."
5,"A great place for trying variety of sandwich, rolls, chaat
Decent seating space and the prices are affordable"
5,"It is the best place for people who love sandwiches, fast food and thick shakes .
We get quality food with a very yummy taste , there is no compromise with the hygiene. And it is pocket friendly .
200-400 - for 2 person
hygiene- 5/5
Quality -4/5
Taste -4.8/5
Overall - 4.9/5"
5,"By far this place offers One of the finest pure  veg & Jain Sandwiches in Navi Mumbai.
The menu is very interesting with almost all flavours covered for sandwiches as well as pizza.
They do offer juices and authentic North India Chaat & Paani puri options.

Very clean and hygienic place with good trained staff who is very professional and active in serving on time.

New location next to reliance fresh under metro bridge sector 19.

Overall score 8/10"
4,"I recently tried the Sev Puri and dahi Puri at Chaatwich, and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by the level of spice they delivered. I had requested extra spice, and they certainly delivered on that front. The puris were nice and crispy, with a good balance of flavors that made them a joy to eat. The meetha chutney was particularly delicious and added an extra layer of flavor.

However, I did feel that the price was a bit steep for what was essentially a street food snack. While the taste was good, the small serving size left me feeling like I hadn't quite got my money's worth.

I also ordered a chocolate milkshake, but unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. While it was decent enough, it was pretty average compared to other milkshakes I've had in the past.

Overall, I had a good experience at the restaurant. However, I would skip the chocolate milkshake next time and stick to the savory snacks."
4,"One of the best places in Kharghar where you find tasty chaat, Sandwiches, and pizza.

We have tried Pani puri, Aloo papdi chaat, and Veggie Pizza and all were mouth-watering.

Sufficient seating area. Also, Parking of vehicles will not be an issue.

They have outlets in Kharghar sector 4, Belapur, Ulwe, Nerul, and Ghansoli too.

One can also order from Zomato and swiggy.

Do follow us on Instagram:- xplorewithmosh"
1,"Wish I had checked the earlier reviews before coming here. While the pizza was decent, the rest of the experience was incredibly disappointing. Ordered cheese garlic bread but was served plain garlic bread with a dip instead. When I raised the issue, the staff didn‚Äôt bother acknowledging it‚Äîjust walked off into the kitchen without a word.

Asked for the bill and waited for 15 minutes. Nothing. Finished eating, asked again‚Äîstill ignored. The guy responsible was just lounging around, completely indifferent.

To make matters worse, the place was swarming with mosquitoes. And the toilet? Absolutely disgusting‚Äîfilthy enough to make a public restroom seem hygienic in comparison. Zero attention to cleanliness or basic service. Would not recommend visiting this place, very doubtful about hygiene and wouldn‚Äôt order from this also."
1,"Mojo pizza is definitely here to stay in the market. I reside in Mumbai so I mostly order pizza from the Mumbai outlets and I love their pizza‚Äôs. I was in Kharghar for few days and saw and outlet so I decided to order.
I ordered BBQ Chicken Pizza which has Spicy Jalapeno, Sweet Corn, Tomato. I instructed them not to add Jalapeno however they did not add tomato and sweet corn too. The chicken was all burnt and did not taste good at all.
The only good part was even on delivery the pizza was crisp and hot. Thanks for the quick delivery but quality of pizza they provided from this outlet was pathetic and it needs improvement."
3,"I love pizzas and have tried from here many times.Mojos serve some amazing pizzas. I ordered three different pizzas frome here.
They offer 10 inch pizzas and lot of variety to choose from.
I ordered
‚ò∏ Paneer Tikka Pizza
If was full of veggies and topped with paneer tikka. It was very flavourful and aromatic. Well cooked and fresh paneer. It was cheesy and yummy.

‚ò∏Chicken Kheema Pizza
It was decent in taste can be better. Made from fresh ingredients and cheesy.

‚ò∏ Farm Fresh pizza
Thin crust pizza topped with veggies and lot of cheese. It was really tasty and must try.

‚ò∏ Lava Cake
Properly packed and cooked Lava cake. Moist and rich in taste. It was perfectly sweet. Perfect end to the perfect party.
Delivery was on time. Pizzas were pipping hot. They serve some amazing affordable pizzas must try for sure"
5,"Mojo Pizza offers variety of amazing and delicious pizza's with 2x toppings. It was my first time of mojo pizza which I never had before. I ordered from their app so that fetched me great discount on my first order. The pizza arrived well in time. The amount of ""Seekh"" on pizza was great.

I had :

Chicken Seekh Kebab
Garlic Breadstikcks with Cheesy Dip
Pepperoni & Chesse"
4,"Pizza lovers must try  Mojo pizza taste is good,stuffing and topping is yummy and tasty
You will get variety of Veg and Nonveg Pizzas,garlic bread here."
3,"The Had a great experience at Hotel Pranam in Kharghar! The Butter Chicken was absolutely delicious ‚Äì rich, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. It's a nice family-friendly restaurant with a comfortable ambiance. Also appreciated that they have parking available, which made things super convenient. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area!"
3,"I visited Pranaam with my family for a quick bite. We ordered Roti, Tawa Sabzi, and Peach Iced Tea. The food was good, and the ambience was pleasant too. It took ages to get my Peach Iced Tea, and when I finally got it, it was rather warm at the first sip. I had requested less ice, but I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be warm Overall, it‚Äôs a great place for veg. I haven‚Äôt tried their non-veg dishes, so I can‚Äôt comment on that.

P.S Second time visiting the restaurant. We ordered Chicken Lapeta, Roti and Peach iced tea (the only other available options in lemon iced tea) It tasted good. The gut wasn't too well the next day. Idk what triggered it. The chicken or the icetea. But well, my mum & had a bout of indigestion the next day."
4,"Excellent dining experience with family. It is a popular dine out joint in Kharghar. Service is very prompt and courteous. Food are good in taste and portion size. They serve North Indian/Mughlai and Chinese cuisine, in both vegetarian and non-vegetarian choice. We ordered Aloo-Makai tikki and Honey-Chilli Chicken as starter and Dal Fry, Veg Malvani Handi and Chicken Maratha with Rice and Butter Naan in main course. All items are well cooked and tasty. Cost-wise also reasonable. Although the restaurant is not new but looks like new, which testament their upkeeping of interior, furniture, cutlery and crockery. It also has a small banquet for small functions."
3,"OŒ∑—î œÉ∆í –º è friend had Suggested –º—î–Ω —ÇœÉ visit this restaurant,Located In Kharghar, initially the ambience was nice And descent, œâ—î ordered chicken Lollypop,Chkn Fried Rice,Chicken Manchurian Gravy ,Masala papad ,Tandoori Roti ,rosali Kabab chicken And Sweet Lime Soda, overall Food Experience was Ok ok, Not so good ,Not so Bad, but taste œÉ∆í —Ç–Ω—î taste was Œ∑œÉ—Ç œÖœÅ —ÇœÉ expectations, also its Œ∑œÉ—Ç Worth FÔ£ßÃêÃ£Ã•R money , because œÉ∆í it‚Äôs over Pricy menu.

4,"Ambience is nice with music playing very softly.

Food is tasty. Tandoori lollypop is properly marinated and cooked. Chicken Satey with peanut sauce is mouth watering.

Provides service of vallet parking"
5,Nice place to morning walk.you can gate feel of water fountain here. Mind relaxing place. You can get peace here with less noise. Feels heaven as it is very silent place looks like it is situated outside the city. amazing city view can be seen.
4,Excrement getaway place with family and friends. Less crowdy in the morning time.  Crowd start increases after 11 am. Not a dangerous falls so that you can take your children too. Excellent place for photography. There place is not so far from the high way.  Chat centres are their to fulfil your hunger. There are no of small falls you can really enjoy here..
4,"The view is pretty good. But it hasn't been recognised as a ""spot"" so there's no security or anything here. Just a bunch of college groups, couples and the native people. A small trek on the small mountain and there you have an awesome waterfall and a great view of kharghar."
5,"The view here is splendid. Especially during the monsoons. The place is just too beautiful and charming, waterfalls at every corner of the mountain. The greenary takes ur heart away, its very relaxing and calm."
5,"Yes...I always love to go here.
With nature and natural jacuzzi,we enjoy a lot.. full lush greenery,body gets relax like anything..."
1,Its lik before very unhigenic...1 order takes 1hr staff always busy on phone n making parcel.
4,"One of the most known place I have visited in kharghar in recent times, this place is very popular for their sandwiches and they also provide mocktails and shakes too, their sandwiches are very good in taste, they represent it very nicely, even the mocktails are good in taste. the quantity is good as per the price. Diet sandwiches are also available over here those who prefer being on diet can try this. We tried aam panna mocktail, the taste was tangy. Overall we would rate this place 4/5."
5,"This place is heaven for street food lovers and chatpata eaters.
Their hygiene is amazing, taste is lovely. Lip smacking pani puri.

I would suggest you to have 'Paneer Cheese Girlled Sandwich' that's their best to eat. They have never disappointed me in anything.

I visit this place on am average of 5 times a month just for their amazing pani puri."
5,"Gupta Sandwich a brand of its own!!! üêæüë£üêæ
_________________________________________

Every navimumbaikar must have heard about the famous chain of gupta sandwiches!

Dey are quiet famous for their variety of sandwiches but der menu is not restricted only to sandwiches...
Dey do serve other delicacies and beverages too(like pav bhaji..chaaat...juices and shakes etc).

Der Kharghar outlet seems to be bigger dan der famous vashi outlets...this outlet has better sitting arrangement dan der other outlets.

At evening the place is mostly crowded...
Dey provide home delivery too through online food aggregators platfroms like zomato ...swiggy etc so the outlet is quiet busy and Loaded with orders.

So coming to the food...

We tried...
‚ùáÔ∏è Masala Cheese grill sandwich
‚ùáÔ∏è Mini veg sandwich
Nd
‚ùáÔ∏è Cheese Garlic Bread

All were good in taste and pocket friendly...

Do try this place if u are around sec 15 and looking for a pocket friendly meal.

5,"I had paneer chilly cheese grilled here and taste was awesome.it cost me around 110 rs which is quite good ..but talking about taste it is three layered sandwich which contains various chutneys and paneer in it. Which was mouthwatering. One should definitely visit and try this sandwich.
Look= 100%
Taste = 200%
Value for money"
4,"I saw few reviews ....which r negative altogether probably they worked on it n served better than tym
Everything is good about sweets I found sweets fresh on a random day visit
Counter for farsan cold drinks and snacks
Person at reception was so humble he was providing all the details abt sweets
Only thing I want to mention ...shop is clean n method used to serve eatables  are hygienic but I want to see more cleaniness on the floor and at the entrance .......
Make a visit for motichoor n gulab jamun very yummy"
2,Unhygienic place to visit. Food and drugs department rules are not followed. No correct expiry dates are displayed. The staff and the owner are rude. They use the same credit card payment machine for both the sweet shop and medical store.
1,"Rude is what you experience, the reason being they don't know hospitality, hygiene, taste and customer service. Street food stalls can survive outside this shop and the credit goes to them. Bikaner needs to raise its standards."
1,"I recently visited the samosa shop in Sector 10 with the intention of buying some samosas. However, I was appalled by the unhygienic practices I witnessed during my time there.

Upon arrival, I noticed a person frying samosas outside the shop in a highly unhygienic manner. What shocked me even more was when one of the samosas accidentally fell onto the dirty floor, covered in oil and other dirt. Rather than discarding the contaminated samosa, the person picked it up and dropped it back into the frying oil. This disregard for basic hygiene standards left me questioning the cleanliness of the entire establishment.

When I confronted the shopkeeper about this unsanitary act, I was met with denial and a dismissive attitude. He claimed that he had already instructed his staff not to repeat such actions. However, his response only further solidified my concerns about the hygienic practices of this shop. It was evident that a lack of proper supervision and enforcement of cleanliness guidelines was resulting in unhygienic food preparation.

The state of the shop's floor further added to my concerns. It was visibly dirty and unclean, which raised doubts about the overall cleanliness of the food preparation area. It is unacceptable to expect customers to tolerate such unsanitary conditions, especially when we are directly consuming these products.

This is not the first time I have experienced issues at this shop. On a previous visit, I noticed an abundance of mosquitoes flying around the samosas without any precautions taken. Selling contaminated food is not only unprofessional but also poses serious health risks, especially to children.

While it is true that this shop may hold a monopoly in Sector 10, it should never be an excuse for compromising on cleanliness and hygiene standards. As customers, it is our responsibility to demand and expect clean and safe food for ourselves and our families.

In conclusion, I strongly advise against purchasing anything from this samosa shop in Sector 10 due to their consistently unhygienic practices. It is important to prioritize the health and safety of ourselves and our loved ones over convenience. Let us encourage establishments to maintain proper cleanliness standards and hold them accountable for any lapses in hygiene."
2,they have served me imarti which was very old in terms of days..
4,"It's an open restaurant more like Street food. We specially went Apple mint to try litti choka. It was worth it. Litti was served hot  with choka (the vegetable which was served cold, is the only part I didn't like) and green chutney. Over all it's a must try the taste is great."
1,The owner of the shop is really rude and arrogant. Once you interact you'll feel like cancelling the order and walk away. Staff is good though but very unhygienic. They don't wear gloves while cooking nor would wash hands. I ordered litti chooka which was average. I would not recommend this place due to owners rude behaviour.
3,"This place is famous for their LITTI CHOKA
But we tried momos instead of it.
It was an average momo in taste.
You will find sitting in walk Arad which is very disturbing.
Even beggars came while we were eating."
1,Owner rudely behave and he talks to you like you eat there food for free I never see those type of toxic Owner
3,"Located at Hiranandani Crystal plaza, the place is pretty popular for it's litti chokha, apart from it they do serve Chinese, momos & paratha.
The litti Chokha tastes good nothing extraordinary."
5,"I tried the hot chocolate, veg grilled cheese burger & mixed sauce pasta, and everything was delicious!
The best part was the chef personally coming to ask for feedback and making adjustments if needed‚Äîsuch a personalized touch. You can feel the care and passion in the food.
Definitely planning to revisit and try more dishes"
5,"The ambiance and atmosphere is very nice and cozy we have tried two type of thin crust pizza one is margarita and other one is panner pizza both are very delicious and cheesy and also we have ordered one mocha and brownie with mocha they are also very tasty.
It is wonderful spot for coffee and pizza lovers and a comfortable place to relax. The decor is aesthetically pleasing with soft light."
5,Hugs and mugs serves amazing food. Their english breakfast menu is a must try. Variety of amazing flavourful dishes. The ambience is great for a cozy dine in. Highly recommended
5,"An ambient place to have food. I tried chicken steak, chicken sizzler and pancakes. Everything was really great and especially the pancakes. Never had this good pancakes before."
4,"I enjoyed a delightful meal with a creamy B√©chamel sauce, perfectly cooked chicken, and expertly toasted cheese toast. The silky sauce complemented the tender chicken beautifully, while the crispy, golden-brown cheese toast added a satisfying contrast of textures. Each element was crafted with care, creating a comforting and harmonious culinary experience. Highly recommended!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
4,"Had Chicken Keema Pav. It was tasty.
A must try"
4,"The most affordable and tasty food ever had in navi mumbai,the ambience isn't good fir family hangouts but you can go in with your friends and have your tummy full for as low as possible.
I had lachha paratha with chicken kheema and chicken tikkka masala ,the food wasn't that spicy and was good and overall it was a good experience...!!"
1,Ordered Chicken Bhuna masala from swiggy but its only name for dish Worst food and too much oily no taste . Totally waste of money never ever gonna order again
5,"Food is decent.  Prices are reasonable so you may jump in for some quick takeaway food mostly kebabs, tandoori dishes with rotis and biryanis. Don't expect amazing taste and super sonic service at this price.
Atmosphere is ok, as in a small gala where you stand and collect the food.They have got space on the mezzanine floor, but with limited seating mostly for bachelors only."
1,"I would have given zero star, had that been an option. The worst food I had ever. In the name of food it was just oil. I am sure they are fooling people with their paid reviews of over 4 stars on Swiggy that easily misleads customers. I atleast taken out 200 ml of oil from my dishes. I felt sick after eating that food. The biryani, the veg roll and the paneer masala all had humongous amount of oil making the food like a river of oil, for which I paid Rs.600. Swiggy should blacklist these kinds of restaurants."
5,"Truly an amazing place to hangout while having good food. The service was really quick and helpful. The overall ambience was decent and comfortable. The food was underrated tbh, I thought there would be more people talking about it cause i absolutely loved it. The owner is muslim and the waiters claim that the food is halal which increased my food options even more."
5,That coffee shop is truly amazing! I understand what you mean when you say allowing it to cool slightly enhances the coffee's flavor. I appreciate the motorsport based ambience. The food options are awesome. The location is very accessible. Must visit if you are near Kharghar.!!!
4,"This is hands down my favorite caf√©‚Äîit consistently serves some of the best food I‚Äôve had. Whether it‚Äôs breakfast, lunch, or dinner, every meal here hits the mark with flavor, presentation, and freshness.

What makes this place truly special is its versatility. It‚Äôs perfect for a cozy date, a fun outing with friends, quality time with family, or even a peaceful solo visit with a book or your thoughts. The vibe is warm and welcoming, the ambience thoughtfully curated, and the staff always friendly.

Caf√© hopping is one of my favorite things to do, and I can confidently say this gem is one of the best that Kharghar has to offer. If you‚Äôre looking for good food, good vibes, and a place that feels like a little escape from the chaos‚Äîthis caf√© is it."
4,"Came here for coffee, wasn‚Äôt bad, nothing great though. Just shy of specialty coffee IMO.
Pretty much same for the food.
Tanveer‚Äôs service was good though."
4,"Good stuff here. Garlic bread was good, so was the pasta. Kids approved. Staff needs to be trained better."
5,Place is located besides little world mall. Has decent ambience and seating available. Tried double crust pizza and it was delicious. Prepared perfectly! Pizza was baked from fresh ingredients and you would not want to leave even sides. Service is decent.  Pricing is reasonable.
3,"Visited this place after reading so many positive reviews. Had Panner garlic bread and crazy cheese pizza.
The garlic bread was good.
But the pizza was very disappointing. It was loaded with some sauce which was on the sweeter side. It has cheese sauce & jalape√±os sauce which dint go well. Also the crust was very thick. Not sure if I would want to pay a second visit.
Ambience is fine."
4,"Decent place to hangout with friends or to plan a party. I did enjoy their pizza but  rest of the items aren't that great. especially beverages. They are overpriced and not worth it. So is garlic bread stick and other appetizers.
Restaurant is rather small, approximately 4 or 5 tables each accommodating upto 4 people comfortably, so plan accordingly and also ask for any offers!!!"
3,"The place is not much crowded at night. Is at a walking distance from Kharghar station near little world mall. The place generally serves pizza, pasta, garlic bread. Loved the cheese garlic bread. Had order white sauce pasta, the quantity was very very less according to the price, as in only sufficient for one person, but the taste was really good. Do not go for Tandoori Paneer pizza, not that good. The place consists of Self service. Recommended if you wanna to hang out with group of friends. Not a romantic place though. Pocket friendly, 1000 for 3 person. All in all had a good experience here, since the service was quick."
1,"Horrible experience
The AC was not working
There is no water available.
U have to order packaged water.
The staff is rude and ill mannered and chapri
Types.
Please explore better alternatives."
2,"Worst dominos I have ever seen in my life they do not have a basic card payment . Only you can pay through upi. The atmosphere is not so good. It is better to get it packed with orders from home.
Not Recommended  for dine in."
1,"The order was for Jamaican chicken medium cheese burst. Instead I got a pizza with 1 type of chicken and 3 colors of capsicum and cheese burst.
I gave the store person the pizza back and told that this wasn‚Äôt the correct pizza.
He gave another one with correct toppings but no cheese burst. Instead cheese was just poured over it like water. The pizza wasn‚Äôt baked properly and the cheese was liquidy throughout the time I and my friend tried to eat. We ended up eating it since it was already 10:45 pm and we couldn‚Äôt wait anymore. This wasn‚Äôt even cheese burst. The sauce wasn‚Äôt uniformly spread and was in 2 slices only. As it was very late in the night i didn‚Äôt want to spend time arguing with the store people.
Very poor experience overall. Most disappointed at this store in Little World Mall Kharghar."
4,"The order came quickly. The taste was very similar to what Domino's gives so the overall experience was satisfying.
Very less crowded place"
5,"I have ordered a Barbecue chicken pizza and fresh veggies cheese Burst pizza. Bbq chicken pizza was so yummy I loved it. Fresh veggies cheese burst pizza was very tasty. In every bit of pizza, the cheese drips into the mouth and it tastes yummy"
1,"The worst pizza is dominos Pizza, I ordered pizza late night they are not delivering and not giving any response"
1,"Sells infected chicken.

Seating capacity too low as compared to other outlets.

Staff is good.

Products are average.

Need to work on quality.

Have seen many complaints for online order, customer literally visited this branch for refund."
1,"I ordered veg patty rice but the patty was totally raw from inside.When I told to the staff she told I will make other one and give to you,as of after 20 mins she did not give yet"
1,"Do not order KFC online, either through their app or the KFC website. They do not honor the delivery. Even after waiting for 2 hours, I ultimately had to go to the KFC restaurant at Little World Mall and pick it up myself, despite choosing delivery. Had a very bad experience. Even though I love KFC, I will not order it again to avoid the frustration and agony. Truly disappointed.

Helpline number in KFC app is simply of no use."
1,The resturant workers wait till 11:01 pm not serving customers and beating around the bush for 5 mins just to say they are not taking orders after 11pm. Pathetic service and attitude of the staff. KFC India needs to look at this.
1,"I placed an order at this outlet yesterday at 9:15 pm for home delivery, opting for cash on delivery. The app showed an estimated delivery time of 10:00 pm(which was already late considering I only ordered popcorn and wings), but even by 10:30 pm, the status remained stuck on ""We are preparing your order."" I tried calling the outlet twice, but no one answered. The delivery person never showed up, and the app still shows ""Order on the way"" even on the next day.

What‚Äôs worse, no staff member reached out to inform me of any delays or issues. A simple call would have allowed me to make alternate food arrangements, but there was zero communication.

This is highly disappointing and unprofessional. If KFC can‚Äôt manage home deliveries effectively, they should rethink offering the service. Thankfully, I didn‚Äôt pay online, or it would have been even more frustrating.

I don‚Äôt recommend opting for home delivery from this location ‚Äì it‚Äôs unreliable and poorly managed. If you‚Äôre craving KFC, dine-in or takeaway might save you a lot of frustration."
3,"Found it to be okay, compared to some of the positive reviews posted here.
Too expensive at this time. We had skipped McD and BK from Little World mall nearby and went in for nostalgia.
Limited and overpriced options with possibly similar quality at a McD at half the price.
Okay to try once a while!"
3,"Pros:
-Indian/Desi brand of coffee, which means my default support to them

-value for money coffee and drinks as per my pov

-red berry mojito was good but too sugary for my taste (3/5)

-ample free Street parking available hassle free

Cons:
-space could be more cleaner and tidy

-need to increase vegetarian/vegan menu items  especially in coffee milks"
5,It's a nice CCD with good range of beverage and snacks options. I tried a sandwich and it tasted good. Good to spend time and have a cup of coffee here.
4,"Nice Place to visit. I ordered 2 Cappuccino and one Chocolate cake here..
The staff was so polite while placing the orders and they also accept magicpin here so this was the unique thing which I experience here..I visited this place a month back!!
So it's nice place.

Cheers!‚ô•Ô∏èüòä"
4,"Really good, peaceful location, ample space, cosy atmosphere, both indoor and outdoor seating, average service and affordable prices."
3,Average me theek thaak hai not bad it's good
1,"Kindly update there is no aakhol exotic biryani,"
5,Best Place for biryani lovers
5,Great biryaani experience
4,Here is good
3,"The name is now changed to Lucky darbar. It barely has a dining only for 4 people on the footpath. Chicken Triple Fried Rice is good in taste.
Quantity is not that great. Chicken chilly was okish. It would be better not to dine there and order food from online if u want to try anything from there. The price is more the quantity they serve"
1,"Hopeless Taste, Fake Ratings
Review Body: Ordered from Nice Moments and deeply regret it. The taste was absolutely pathetic, and the quality was nowhere near acceptable. This restaurant seems to survive on fake ratings. I strongly recommend avoiding this place and saving your time and money."
5,"The food quality with service and staff behaviour is too good, also the hygiene they maintained superb. For family and friends it's super point for all type of lunch and dinner"
1,I ordered Chicken Fried rice and it is complete waste. Feels like u are having rice with a sack full of salt in it n eggs smells like hell. I had to throw it away since nobody had it. Even the shezwan was like water tasteless. Not expected this. Please improve your standards
4,Food is amazing and the best part is their super fast preparation time... They try to maintained hygiene in their kitchen with cooks using hair net and gloves... It's only take-away and delivery only... No dine-in
1,"I had 2 Donuts and one piece cake, donut Qulity is total disappointed, I think donut are very old bcz bread was very hard I didn't feel like I am eating donut, nonsense test... shop just make impression but food Qulity is worst"
1,Very bad.....never purchase from here.....cake is taste less or bad smelling .......
1,"I visited the bakery 2 times and I found that the pastries, Cakes nd plumcakes had worst tastes when compared all other bakers. All these were completely filled with syrups and foul smell of oil. Complete Waste of money."
4,"All types of cakes pastries are available here. If you want another type of cake you have to preorder it they make it available.
I had bought rasmalai cake but it was not so tasty."
1,"I don't know if this is fake location or fake business profile. because picturea are of Sec35E Kharghar, Proviso Complex. But address mentioned here is Kamothe Provisao complex. Customers please don't pay fpr online delivery.

Anyways review for kharghar shop mongini cakes.

Not so great about their cakes. You can get discounts only on stale cakes. in my last visit, I realised that I got stale pastries (with rough base) even after they assured me that its fresh, it was required for my kid. we cannot taste it beforehand. Uchi dukaan feeka pakwan."
5,"Asia's Second Largest ISKCON TEMPLEü©µ
This Spiritual Gem in Navi Mumbai Kharghar, newly inaugurated on January 15, 2025 by PM Narendra Modi. Spread over 9 acres, it took 12 years and Rs. 170 crore to complete.

The Temple follows Traditional Vastu Shastra principles, creating a space that naturally invokes calmness and devotion. Intricate carvings, majestic domes, and towering spires reflect classic temple architecture, while spacious prayer halls and open courtyards enhance the spiritual experience. The idols are placed in a beautifully decorated sanctum, surrounded by detailed artwork that celebrates Krishna consciousness.

Beyond a place of worship, it offers holistic development through its Ayurvedic center, guesthouse, and upcoming Vedic museum.
This Architectural Marvel isn't just a place of worship‚Äîit's a sanctuary of culture, devotion, and divine energy.

5,"I visited ISKCON Kharghar in evening. I missed the morning aarti that begins at 6:30 AM, I highly recommend arriving early ‚Äî the peaceful ambiance and morning rituals are truly divine.

Outside the main hall, food coupons are available, and the prasadam (meals) service starts daily at 12:30 PM.

The temple premises offers seating areas, inviting devotees to linger and soak in the divine energy that permeates every corner of this sacred space.

The architecture, the aura, and the quiet devotion it inspires make it a peaceful retreat from city life.

The temple is a heaven of spiritual bliss, enveloped in a profoundly divine atmosphere that transcends the mundane.

Overall, ISKCON Kharghar is a soulful blend of beauty, spirituality, and culture ‚Äî truly deserving of its title as one of the grandest temples in Navi Mumbai."
5,"The temple is a haven of spiritual bliss, enveloped in a profoundly divine atmosphere that transcends the mundane. As one steps into the temple premises, they are greeted by a truly spectacular view that awakens the senses and lifts the spirit.

The ambiance within the temple is nothing short of enchanting, with an aura so divine that it defies description. Every element, from the intricate architecture to the subtle fragrance of incense, seems to blend in perfect harmony to create an atmosphere of deep serenity.

One of the most striking features of the temple is the charming mini fountains that adorn both sides of the premises. The gentle gurgle of water, the soft splashing of droplets, and the mesmerizing dance of light on the rippling surface all combine to create a sense of tranquility that is nothing short of mesmerizing.

The temple premises also offer ample seating areas, inviting devotees to linger and soak in the divine energy that permeates every corner of this sacred space. Whether one seeks spiritual solace, aesthetic pleasure, or simply a moment of peace, this temple is a destination that promises to deliver a truly unforgettable experience."
4,"I recently visited the ISKCON Temple in Kharghar, which is often said to be the second biggest ISKCON temple in India. The place truly lives up to the hype when it comes to beauty and spirituality. Surrounded by lush green mountains, the temple‚Äôs structure looks absolutely stunning. The idols of Radha-Krishna, Krishna-Balram, and the Ramayana scenes are so divine that they instantly touch your heart and make you feel peaceful and connected.

However, there are a few things that could be improved. The management and arrangements inside the temple need attention. Visitors are not allowed to sit for long, which can be uncomfortable, especially for those who want to spend more time in meditation or prayer. Also, the fountains around the temple are not well maintained and need cleaning. One major issue is the poor ventilation in the main prayer area ‚Äî it becomes very suffocating during peak hours or when there is a crowd.

Overall, it‚Äôs a beautiful and spiritual place to visit, but I hope the authorities improve the basic facilities to make the experience more comfortable for everyone."
5,"Great Place to Visit with friends and family.
You have a good bus frequency from kharghar railway station (54 & 45) which can be used by devotees.
like other Iskon temples one can buy clothes, bhagwat gita and many more things from here.
They do have good snacking options available and Govind's kitchen as well where you can enjoy complete meals with thali options as well.
A bit crowded on weekends which is quite expected but worta visit."
4,Very testy
5,"You get a wide variety of dosas here, and they are all very tasty! Although it's a roadside eatery, they have chairs and tables available, so you can sit and enjoy comfortably."
5,"This is arguably the best dosa spot in Kharghar. There is so much crowd gathered here from evening that you may not get a seat.
They have so many options of Dosas and Uttapam to choose from which is so amazing. The taste is great and no two varieties have the same taste so clearly they are using different ingredients.
They have a slightly higher price but it's worth it. The quantity is enough to fill your stomach.

I tried the paneer cheese masala dosa and gini dosa. Highly recommended to try both."
5,"I have been visiting here for more than 3 years and they have same taste and consistency every time. Apart from dosa they are now serving Chinese, chaaps, and mainly north Indian dishes. Their litti chokha is best apart from dosa and must try. They also serve sizzlers which is awesome in taste and presentation. Make sure that during weekends their are less chance that you find space to sit and eat and for parking also you have to find a space to park."
2,"They lack cleanliness specially frankie and sandwiches areae so i wont suggest having frankie or sandwich over here if cleanliness and health is your concern, Dosa area is cleanliness is ok , but frankie areae is absolutely not a good place to cook food. Just had veg cheese frankie and it is bakwas , it just has vegetable and oil that too at 90 rupees price which is higher then other Frankie maker and yet not so good , worst cleanliness and also worst taste"
5,Love the Food quality & taste. They have varieties of Dosa as the name rightly suggests...... Would totally recommend this placeüëå‚úåÔ∏è& they serve good food at reasonable prices. Have been eating from this place for a year now good service with open sitting area. (Might take sometime for seating availability)
4,"My overall experience was good I wont say the best.

Mc puff was 10 on 10
Recommended MC spicy panner burger was 10 on 10
Coffee was 10 on 10
Ice cream was 10 on 10
Coke was 10 on 10 because they gave me ice separately so I can use it as much as I want.
Mc maharaja 0 out of 10 worst experience.

But guys what's wrong with you mc maharaja or take away???
It was cold as hell, lettuce was in bad condition, sauce or that other liquid was missing from burger even patty was not properly done.

This is not fair I told one of your representative, I have dine in hardly 5 min ago n went downstairs with mc maharaja burger but no proper response and other guy was new to place.

Guys I just requested your staff member for take away order because I was running out of time.

It doesn't mean you will give me the worst treatment, accept your mistake and atleast apologies. I have been to this store so many times but this time it was extremely bad experience for take away order.

Again I would like to repeat my dining experience was great all the food was correct and served to me properly within time. I would suggest go for dining plz don't place take away order it's worst experience."
5,"It was the year ending and as expected there was rush.... But the staff came forward and helped right from placing the order through the kiosk till getting the delivery. Thanks guys, you helped me in celebrating my mother's birthday. She turned 85 now."
5,"I went there for the first time For my sister's daughter's birthday Party this location is very close to my house. Second, it is a perfect place for a small family party. The entrance is quite beautiful. Hospitality was quite good, space for children's enjoyment was quite good.and the food was good. There, all the children had veg burgers, French fries with it, veg cutlet or strawberry shake with it, which the children liked very much.and we had non-veg burgers, non-veg cutlet, French fries and coke.
It was quite delicious. They had done very nice decoration. And games were organized for children's. We all had a lot of fun there."
1,"Didn't like the service at all. First of all, i had to wait for around 5-10 minutes because the lady behind counter was busy counting money. After i gave the order, i received the order on time, no doubt. I ordered 2 mc aloo tikki and 1 regular fries. The burgers had least amount of sauce and veggies i ever had in any mcdonalds. The taste was completely dry. The fries i ordered was completely salt less. This was my first time experience in mcdonald's kharghar and i am very disappointed by the service."

1,"The staff will loot you if u are not careful....There is a Happy hours offer by which u can get two waffles at Rs 250....but unless you specifically ask them to apply the offer, they will just do the normal billing...here they charged me 340 for two waffles...i specifically asked her thrice is there any offer today ..she said no offer right now...but then entered a next customer who order the same two waffles and got them at 250 just becoz she told the specific word 'Happy hours'...This is not right..bad customer service! They should tell customers about the offers... Many ppl might not know about the offers!

I will never go to this outlet again! U lost a customer today!"
5,"Very good staff, very polite and soft spoken. Made waffle as per requirement. I have an amazing experience whenever I visit here üòÅüòÅ"
5,Belgium waffle is the best waffle brand as of now. Though the rates are bit hight but tastes good. Also quality is good. The taste all across the outlets are same. I had naked nutella waffle you can also try their blueberry cheesecake waffle. Highly recommended.
4,"The staff here was extremely kind and cooperative. The counter guy even gave me an offer coupon which I couldn't use later on. Rest all was good - The ambience, experience and the waffle at a decent price"
1,"Tried Belgian Waffle at Kharghar first time just few minutes ago on 10th May 11 PM.
Waffles were ok but the guy over the cash counter was very lethargic in response I had to ask every question 3 times to him while he was busy joking around with his team mate.
Belgian waffle taste was fine and seemed good brand, hope they improve their staff attitude.

It seemed that stafff doesnt bother about customers as they come by default basis on brand name but such poor behaviour do reduces brand value"
5,Excellent

5,"Visited this place to try their Mango Menu specifically!! Love their strawberry mango torte & mini strawberry cheesecake. They have these really cute mini cakes with wonderful presentation which you‚Äôll hardly find anywhere else in Navi Mumbai. Probably the best place to get your birthday cake if yo love aesthetics! Coming to the mango menu we also love their mango cupcake so much, found it a bit expensive considering the portion size but definitely worth it because of the taste. Also love their blueberry cheesecake it was so damn goodüòçü•πü§åüèª"
5,"I recently took a takeaway from Bakery Nation, purchasing an √©clair, an apple pie, and a blueberry cupcake. The desserts were absolutely delightful‚Äîperfectly balanced in sweetness without being overpowering. The store offers an impressive variety of desserts, which was almost overwhelming, as every item looked both beautiful and delicious. Their cake section is particularly remarkable, and they even offer customized cakes. I am already planning to get one for my birthday this year from this store!"
5,Got a chocolate mango  cake and Tiramisu cheese cake. Both the cakes were really good. A good spot for cakes and other baked goods in kharghar.
4,Recently visited the place for bread and ended up tasting a few things. Interior is done very aesthetically. Service was prompt and proactive. Liked the place.
3,Foul smell at the moment you enter the shop. Food is good but the ambience just puts you off. Have provided the feedback to staff. Hope Firoz takes action on same.
5,Fusion Eateries is so amazing

4,"Had visited today and had filter dosa and ghee podi dosa
Filter coffee was 10/10 . It was so good we had 2. The taste is just the way it should be and sweetness was also minimal bringing out the actual flavour of the coffee..
Ghee podi dosa 9/10 - this was specially recommended by the owner
The podi was generously fried in ghee and spread over the dosa
Taste was really too good and will be definitely coming back to have it again
The only negative part was both the chutneys which was given along with the podi dosa
Firstly the podi dosa is good enough to have it on its own. No extra accompaniments are required. The chutneys didn‚Äôt add any flavour to the podi dosa and in fact spoiled the taste of it . I guess it‚Äôs good to be given along with the plain dosa or idli
Secondly the white chutney given was a peanut paste and didn‚Äôt have any flavour of coconuts and can be best avoided
Overall this is a must place to visit if you love filter coffee and podi dosa üëç"
5,"Had an awesome experience enjoying dosa here
The dosa is freshly prepared, no soda in the batter
My personal favourite is ghee podi dosa ..the owner is so humble and the prices are also pocket friendly
Also must try filter coffee ‚òï"
5,"Here‚Äôs my review of a wonderful experience at Andhra Dosa in Sector 19, Kharghar:

If you‚Äôre in the area, make sure to visit Ms. Sushma at Andhra Dosa and treat yourself to their authentic dosas. I‚Äôve visited many dosa spots, but her preparation truly stands out. The batter is made with care‚Äîcompletely natural, without soda or artificial fermentation.

We tried the Ghee Dosa, and even before the first bite, the aroma of genuine A2 ghee was enough to assure us of its quality. I highly recommend trying the Podi Ghee Dosa and the Moong Dosa‚Äîboth are simply exceptional.

We also had the pleasure of chatting with Ms. Sushma about her inspiring journey in starting this authentic Andhra dosa spot. Her dedication and passion are evident in every bite.

Best wishes to her, and we can‚Äôt wait to visit again!"
5,"Had the pleasure of dining at Andhra Dosa and it was an exceptional experience! The dosa was perfectly crispy, with just the right balance of flavors. But what truly elevated the meal was the array of chutneys they served ‚Äî each one was fresh, flavorful, and paired beautifully with the dosa. The service was attentive, and the ambiance was cozy, making it a great spot to relax and enjoy a delicious meal. If you are a fan of authentic South Indian cuisine, this place is a must-try. Highly recommend it!!"
5,Nice place for authentic Andhra style Disa served with groundnut and ginger Chutneys... Naturally fermented... Light on stomach...
3,"Tried their mango piece with malia it was white ice cream like thing on name of malai. Costed 170 rs. Not worth at all. Do eat their Mango ice instead it is always a hit product of naturals, this particular mango flavour ice cream never dissapoints."
5,"üåü Natural Ice Cream Never Disappoints! üåü

I visit Natural Ice Cream occasionally, and every time it‚Äôs worth it! The flavors are fresh, authentic, and made with real ingredients. My favorites are Tender Coconut and Sitaphal (Custard Apple) ‚Äì they have a natural taste that‚Äôs hard to find elsewhere.

The quality and creamy texture make it a go-to place whenever I crave ice cream. The staff is polite, and the service is always quick. If you‚Äôre looking for a delicious and refreshing treat, I highly recommend Natural Ice Cream!"
5,"National icecream is best as it doesn't have anything artificial added.
Seasonal fruit is best currently due to heavy heat and mango season mango ice-cream is best .
Even we tried jackfruit"
1,"I visited Natural Ice Cream in Kharghar today and was disappointed with my experience. Here's why:
The ice cream cone was underbaked, which affected the overall taste and texture.
The store is extremely congested, making it difficult to move around
The staff seemed overwhelmed, leading to noisy and inefficient
- Ensure proper baking of cones.
- Renovate or reorganize the store for better customer comfort.
- Train staff for better service

I hope Natural Ice Cream takes these suggestions seriously and improves their overall experience."
5,"Very nice natural ice cream. I went 2 times last week. The taste of their natural and seasonal ice cream is best especially Mango, strawberry, watermelon and coconut.

They need to improve some space as it's very crowded at night time."
5,"Recently visited this place and I must say it‚Äôs gem of a place serving unique fast food and Chinese dishes.
The big guy burger was super loaded and super crispy, totally worth the price.  Even the classic veggie burger was so delicious. Although I loved everything that we tried my favourite was the Chicken bomb sub-wich . The Chinese food was also amazing. We tried the chilli garlic noodles and paneer chilli. Another unique dish was the mozzarella gold digger Corndog another super crispy, cheesy and yum dish. Cold coffees were also great"
5,"This place has the best burgers and corndogs in Kharghar! I started with their Regular Veg Burger and mozzarella corndog, then tried the Special Chicken Burger and wow, there‚Äôs no going back!üçî They have also introduced Chinese on their menu which is also incredibly yummü§§. In Chinese, I would recommend to have any of the dishes because the sauce itself is very tastyyyyüíØ  I personally prefer their Chilli Gralic noodles üçù Most importantly, it is very pocket friendly!"

The service was top-notch, with friendly and attentive staff that made us feel right at home. What‚Äôs even better is that it‚Äôs budget-friendly, without compromising on taste or quality.
If you‚Äôre in the area, don‚Äôt miss this place ‚Äì highly recommended!"""
1,"I was disappointed with my recent visit. The momos were undercooked, and the filling was insufficient. Additionally, the sauces didn‚Äôt taste fresh. The seating area was not clean, and there were dirty plates left on the table. Service could also use improvement. I hope these issues can be addressed."

5,Very good experience for Breakfast. Filter coffee was very good. Their dosa was thick but very crispy and tasty. Sambar was yam and chutney were awesome. Must try.
5,"It's good. Idli was soft, khara bhaat was prepared in ghee. They have tried to keep the authentic taste of South Indian food. The chutney taste is good, but is served cold, straight from the fridge.

Idli: 5/5
Khara bhaat 5/5
Chutney 5/5
Sambhar 3/5"
5,"Authentic South Indian Breakfast Is Now In Khargharüòç

Loved their dosa and filter coffee"
1,"Horrible staff. Ordered via Swiggy and the shop sent the wrong bag of chips. Annoyed with their behavior, our friend thought of weighing their packets and we discovered they don't send the right quantifies. That's less chips, not more. This doesn't cut it with us."
5,Variety of chips available here along with mixtures

1,I had a very bad experience.. The biryani was not at all hot it was all cold and looked of yesterday. When I contacted on their customer care they refunded partially but only credited on IB wallet upon asking to refund it to original mode of payment they said they don't have such platform to do so.. So requesting not to place any order here if you really want to experience your Biryani taste bitter. PATHETIC.
5,"Today we have ordered large size chicken dum biryani...
Taste was awesome...
Specially the chicken salan serve with the biryani enhance it's taste...
Quantity and Quality upto the mark...
We 4 people enjoyed the fist ..."
1,Worst service.
1,Yesterday visited this place for the 1st time to try icecream milkshake which was on offer price of everything at Rs.99 it's was a scam they charge extra gst on bill. Worse drinks ever we ordered chocolate brownie shake and Mango mastani which was pathetic both drinks where full of fizz n less milk n no icecream in it pani wala items n mango mastani tastes like pista drink. 3rdclass service by this Frozen Bottle Kharghar. Sach a waste of money üëéüèº
5,"Best Sundaes . On India's first Gourmet Sundae. 100% vegetarian and 200% tasty. A must Try dessert. The taste was simply heavenly and made me feel truly satisfied. For myself being an extreme chocolate lover this flavor was truly mind blowing and the shake was thicker and yummier.Thanks to the Frozen bottle team over here for introducing themselves with such a good flavor!
Will definately come the next time (and many more times) and will be on my priority list for midnight drinks üòÅ"
5,"Very nice and cozy outlet. Serves excellent milkshakes and desserts. Located at prime location right beside the little world mall and also at walking distance from kharghar railway station.
Coming to the food...shakes at this place are just excellent. Been here many times and it never fails to impress me. Butterscotch milkshakes is just amazing. Also nutty chocolate, berry blast, snicker are nice
Must trys -

1) Butterscotch milkshake
2) Berry blast milkshake
3) Oreo milkshake
4) Snickers superior milkshake

Also uber eats has some exciting offers on frozen bottle. Check them out."
2,I've tried milkshakes here multiple times and let me tell you the milk shakes are not the best I've tasted. The milkshakes always were too frothy (hardly anything left to drink) and tasted like a lot of water or ice mixed with a little milk. Better to go to Baskin Robbins or Naturals across the road for some yummy milkshakes or ice-cream.
4,"This place has delicious milkshake, ice cream jars and stone jars. I loved the ambience and the service. The staff is professional, polite and prompt. This place is small but the decor is refreshing. Loved few desserts and did not liked other at all. Brownie overdose had very hard brownie, the brownie which breaks the spoon. The ice cream on 2-3 desserts were similar, which makes the dessert taste familiar. May be I ordered desserts of same family."
4,"It was really a great experience.
I would highly recommend their chocolate n cheese cake ice cream.
I wish they would have more options in chocolate.
Overall, the best ice cream as per price."
2,The store has pathetic service people with minimal hygiene & lot of mosquitoes. Two slow staff was all the time busy packing orders for Swiggy or Zomato. Not bothered about the customer who has taken the pains to enjoy the ice cream at its parlor & waiting for its turn for 20 min. I will think twice about visiting again.
5,"Apsara Ice Creams in Kharghar, Navi Mumbai, is a delightful gem for ice cream enthusiasts. The vibrant ambiance coupled with an extensive menu of delectable flavors makes it a go-to spot for sweet cravings. The staff's friendly demeanor enhances the overall experience, creating a welcoming atmosphere. The ice cream quality is exceptional, boasting rich, creamy textures and a diverse range of flavors that cater to various tastes. The portions are generous, offering great value for money. If you're a natural flavoured ice cream lover, guava, roasted almonds, strawberry, sitafal, anjeer are some crazy flavours to try here kulfis are also too good, Apsara Ice Creams is sure to satisfy your sweet tooth. Highly recommended!"
5,"Good variety of ice cream,but "" Guava icecream with chilly powder""is a must try"
5,"They have the best flavours in any type...right from mango strawberry to unique ones like panipuri chatka, pineapple berry, chocolate punch, Kesar pista,  cherry, paan masala, and many more for your surprise.

The staff is very cordial and explain the contents very well, serves politely , and always allow you to taste new favours.

Frankly speaking,I was not a huge ice-cream fan before, but with these flavours and the ever experimenting team who creates unique favours to try, this one is definitely in my to do list every now and then.

Do visit once to explore the taste...and see for yourself why this Ice cream store is better than any other store.
It's at Kharghar shilpa chowk , next to Daman showroom.immediately after Apeejay School."
5,"Awesome place. Unique pani puri flavours. If you're a North Indian in true sense..you should visit here. Awesome food, top-notch quality. Must visit"

1,"Two incidents occurred to rate this ,
1st we were eating quietly and then out of nowhere the server boy put the tissue box from our table to counter. (Who are the tissue paper for?)
2nd After asking for a bottle of water, he didn't give us so we bought from another shop but later he told us to pay for the water bottle too.
We pay not only for food but also for the service.
If you don't care to serve the customer then the customer will also stay away from such places.
You lost a customer.

(Edit: we were the only customers present, second just ask your employees to behave. It's sad .. we used to come regularly to eat there."
5,"""I had the pleasure of trying the Aloo Tikki Chaat at Urban Chaat Factory, and it was absolutely phenomenal! The tikki was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, topped with tangy tamarind chutney and fresh yogurt. The balance of flavors was spot on, bringing back memories of my childhood visits to Delhi. The portions were generous and served with a sprinkle of pomegranate seeds for that extra pop. Highly recommend!"""
5,Had Palak patta chaat. It was delicious. Tried something new and loved it.
4,Great chaat items. Tried palak patta chaat. The base was crispy and the spicing was perfect. The dahi could have been richer or thicker and it would be comparable to Delhi Street chaat
5,"I happened to visit Urban Chaat Factory in Kharghar and tried variety of dishes. Their signature dish BASKET CHAAT is a must try.The blend of spices, tangy tamarind chutney, and crisp puris is simply divine, and leaves you craving for more. Recommend you all to enjoy their delicacies."
4,"It's a nice small cozy Cafe and Bar. Going out here for drinks is preferable. Food,we haven't tried much but it was okish good.. Right at the Entrance of Hindu Colony. You might never notice this Cafe while passing by. Good for small group of friends or couple who prefers drinks.. Thanks"
4,ideal place for a small group to hang out over a beer or plan your travel. youthful atmosphere of the bar adds to your enthusiasm. the place is walkable from dadar station making it an ideal choice for a group comprising people from diverse places.  liquor is reasonably priced. food variety is good and tastes very well. seating capacity is a bit limited but there are many high chairs for solo travelers. service is quick and with a smile.
4,"Located near Dadar station, Prithvi's Cavern is a small hangout place with chilled vibes, and not like the unnecessarily loud and boisterous clubs that are popping up everywhere. Last evening we went there early, (we were the first one's to enter in fact) and were greeted by a polite staff, dim lighting and mellow music. We opened our account with Smirnoff and peanuts, which come in two varieties, salted and masala. The Salted Peanuts were, well, salted peanuts, while the Masala Peanuts were really nice, with a seasoning of tomato and onion, not dissimilar to masala papad you might have had. Up next we ordered Chicken Meat Balls, (which weren't ball shaped) nice chunks of chicken, could've been better with some cheese in it. For the next round of drinks we had McDowell and Tropical Cooler, the latter being a mocktail which is converted into a cocktail by adding your choice of spirit to it. It was reminiscent of Blue Lagoon, a commonly served cocktail, since I chose to add vodka to the mocktail. A pointer regarding happy hours, they apply to beer only. Our next starter was Sausage Pepper Chilli Garlic and this was the standout dish for me. Sliced chicken sausages, spiced up with lot of chilli and pepper, with just a hint of garlic, this is a must have here. To end our innings we opted for Cheesy Chicken Nachos and a round of Old Monk. The nachos were a letdown, not as much cheese on it as expected, it was quite bland, even the accompanying salsa couldn't save it, you can give this a miss. To sum up then, Prithvi's Cavern is more a place for drinks and finger food than a wholesome dinner, (no desserts in the menu at all), and does it job quite well without burning up a big whole in your pocket. A bit cramped one might say, but I like the ambience, the music, and had no complaints with the service. I'll definitely be dropping in here again."
5,This is nostalgia should visit who listens to The Beatles Pink Floyd Bee gees. Wine and fine whiskey at this place goes hand in hand. Atmosphere is filled with music n high spirits and staff is polite and helpful worth of money.
4,This place is near Dadar railway station in east. Ambiance is good. Only thing I didnt liked is the time taken to prepare the dish. Hence I would suggest you to give ur order in bulk.
4,In front of Dadar Station. Quick and fast service. Good for quick bites and tea/coffee. I like the Dabeli more. Cheese toast sandwich also good.
4,Very rushy restaurant spot with good quality food and taste of south and Maharashtra foods. With reasonable prices near to dadar railway station. Must try once and have good experience with their food and services.
5,"I was looking for good restaurants around Dadar station and came across Udipi Refreshment. What I really liked about it was the quick service. Right from being handed the menu to taking our order and service, everything was great and taken care of.

It's a very busy resturant with customers in the waiting line to dine in and that's a really good sign of any restaurant. They have two seating sections: Non-AC and AC.

We tried their Mysore Masala Dosa, Idli Medu Wada Sambar and Pav bhaji. The Dosa and Idli Wada Sambar was amazing, so much that we ordered it twice!

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who intends to have a fulfilling meal served soon with great quality and taste!"
1,"The utensils were not cleaned properly very unhygenic.
We tried Rabadi it was average in taste. For the water bottle of MRP 20 you will be charged 25 Rs that too for Non AC dining. And GST will be applied additionally. Pathetic Restaurant. Not recommended."
4,"Must try when you are in dadar.
Very clean n delicious food.
Veg biriyani."
3,Cheese vadapav was nice.

But they allowed us on the weekday. The food quantity is very low and prices are very high. So I didn't like that thing. There are many other better options in Dadar consider this option as last one."
2,"recently visited and was quite disappointed with the overall experience. While the ambiance was decent, the service left much to be desired. The staff behavior was noticeably cold and unwelcoming, which made the visit uncomfortable. Hospitality plays a key role in any dining experience, and unfortunately, this aspect was lacking during my time there. I hope the management looks into staff training to improve customer service in the future."
5,"I recently visited MRP - My Regular Palace, and I have to say it was an amazing experience from start to finish. I decided to try a mix of their offerings and ordered Chicken Biryani, Peri Peri Fries, Thai Curry Rice, along with plenty of beers to wash it all down. The food was incredibly tasty, exceeding my expectations in both flavor and presentation. The Chicken Biryani was cooked to perfection, with tender chicken and a perfect blend of spices that really hit the spot. The Peri Peri Fries were crispy and had just the right level of heat, making them an addictive snack to pair with the beers. The Thai Curry Rice was rich, creamy, and packed with flavors, adding an exotic twist to the meal.

The drinks were great too, with a wide selection of beers served ice-cold, which made the dining experience even more enjoyable. To top it off, the DJ was playing some really good music, creating a lively and upbeat atmosphere. The place had a cool and casual vibe, with just the right balance between being a fun hangout spot and a great place to enjoy good food. Prices were very reasonable, especially considering the generous portions and quality of the food. The combination of delicious food, great music, and chilled beers made it a memorable evening, and I would highly recommend MRP to anyone looking for a laid-back, enjoyable dining and drinking experience."
5,"Nestled in the heart of the city, MRP or My Regular Place restaurant stands out as a culinary gem, offering a delightful fusion of exquisite cuisine and charming ambiance. From the moment you step inside, you are greeted by the warmth of its good interiors. The restaurant's design exudes a sense of sophistication and class, creating a cozy atmosphere that makes you feel right at home.

One of the standout features of MRP is its impeccable management. The team behind this establishment understands the art of hospitality, ensuring that every guest has a memorable dining experience. The staff, in particular, deserves special mention for their professionalism and politeness. Their friendly demeanor and attentive service enhance the overall dining pleasure.

The restaurant's interior is adorned with fabulous decor that complements the overall theme perfectly. A notable highlight is the Feng shui pot, adding a touch  and positive energy to the surroundings. This thoughtful addition speaks volumes about the restaurant's attention to detail, creating an environment where guests can relax and enjoy their meal in peace.

When it comes to the menu, MRP offers a diverse range of culinary delights that cater to various tastes and preferences. The Chinese mule, a refreshing and zesty cocktail, sets the tone for a delightful.."

1,"Rates are higher than pub alcohol prices, once you enter it's a full bad trip"
4,"Once it was only restaurant but now it's restobar. Pleasant interior and optimally lighted. Staff is polite and professional. Food, snack and main dish are good in taste. Very convenient location in the heart of city for local as well as for the travellers, as it's close to bus and railway station."
3,It was look type.. veg food was good in taste.. but has very less veg options.. non-veg was not that good.. have better taste options & taste of seafood.. of you are a smoker you would like this as it has good open space for smoking behind the bar..
4,"Decent bar to have drinks and dinner together, the music played in background really a mood changer. Bar tenders are very experienced and we'll behaved, they really helped us to get the best possible special dinner menu with drinks of the bar."
5,"Well all activities foods drinks , but services  taking time minimum 15-20 minutes fro order  everything is good i feel"
5,Had Been there on a Saturday evening. Saw the 'Today's Special' Board. Quickly ordered Veg Bhuna from it along with cheese garlic butter nan and Masala Papad. The food was awesome and very very Tasty. I will recommend this place for all the persons especially around Dadar Station. This is exactly next to Dadar TT (Khodadad) Circle.
4,"It is practically impossible to imagine Pav Bhaji without thinking of Jyoti Refreshments in Dadar. I've visited this place many times over the past 20-25 years. This Pav Bhaji is nothing but honest-to-goodness, flavour-packed food that hits the spot.

Jyoti's Pav Bhaji delivers a delightful kick, a warmth that builds with each bite. It's not unbearably hot, but certainly not bland. The well-balanced spice level caters to a wide range of palates.

Beyond the food itself, the experience adds to the charm. The bustling atmosphere, the quick service, and the overall sense of being part of a culinary institution contribute to overall enjoyment. While you might have to wait a bit for a table, especially during peak hours, anticipation only makes the first bite even more satisfying.

Jyoti Restaurant's Pav Bhaji is a classic for a reason. It's a delicious, satisfying, and affordable meal that embodies the spirit of Mumbai street food. If you're looking for an authentic and flavourful Pav Bhaji experience in Dadar, this is the place to go. Just be prepared for the crowds ‚Äì it's worth the wait!"
5,"Food is good. Situated at dadarTT on the ground floor.

It‚Äôs has a/c and non a/c section.

Food was good.

Recommended : Medu wada, cheese dosa and grilled sandwich

Service is bit slow.

Ambience is somewhat vintage in style.

Has lot of vegetarian option here.

Staff is good."
5,"I really enjoyed the food here. Despite not being able to eat spice, they adapted the dish to me. The waiter was very attentive and kind to us. They've got an ample variety of food and sweet dishes."
3,"Visited Jyoti for dinner after a very long time. Jyoti is a very old Pure Vegetarian hotel and a landmark at Dadar Circle. I have been visiting it and ordering from it since childhood, but this is the first time I am reviewing it on Maps.

It has a Non AC section on the ground floor and an AC section on the first floor.

We ordered a Jain Masala Papad to start with, but after it came we noticed that there were some pieces on onion on it, so it had to be sent back and we instructed the waiter to bring a fresh Jain Masala Papad. The Paneer Chilly Dry was alright in taste nothing too special, but the quantity felt a bit less for the price. For main course, we ordered Paneer Peshawari and Veg Kolhapuri sabzis with Butter Rotis. Again, taste was good but nothing special or over the top. Portion size of the sabzis was good. Jyoti has more or less maintained it's taste over the years.

But coming to the aesthetics, while I noticed that prices of dishes have gone up significantly, the service and crockery has not improved with the times. We had to instruct the waiter twice to get chutney for the Masala Papad. Spoons were also not given along with the dishes and again instructions had to be given twice for spoons. The plates and other crockery also feel very old and run down. Of course, nothing too fancy can be expected at Jyoti, but given the customer rush even now on weekends and for dinner many a times and the price hikes in dishes, one would expect the restaurant to improve on these niceties. The service was probably the most disappointing aspect in my view.

All in all, Jyoti is a decent restaurant to have food, but don't expect anything over the top. Admittedly it's the best pure vegetarian option available at Dadar TT. However I would personally say that for the price, most fine dine counterparts of Jyoti at Matunga provide a much better experience in taste and service.

On a side note, the South Indian dishes at Jyoti are also worth trying. Jyoti also has its own delivery fleet and can home deliver food in the vicinity."
4,"The place is always crowded due to it's food taste and quality.
The food was tasty with reasonable rate.
Service was quick and good.
Ample place for dining was available.
Misal Pav I've tried here was very good."
2,I have ordered lunch which was nice but the faluda was not worth the money at all. It was watered down and the their was no kulfi in kulfi faluda. When asked later they they said that due to other order our order was delayed and they couldn't do anything now.
1,I'm ordering 3 Lunch thali 2 chapti extra and 2 ice cream and hotel give me 907 bill. I'm totally shock it means one thali 200rs and chapati is 25rs it's so costly. I'm totald every one do not go this hotel
4,A historic restaurant located in Dadar East Market. It is always crowded and loud. We had to wait for approx 10 minutes on a Sunday afternoon. Food is good and reasonably priced. It seems to be only restaurant in the market. Overall satisfactory experience.
4,"Delicious Medu vada, Masala Dosa & Pav Bhaji

Update:Visited on 28th Nov 2018 around 2:30 pm, staff was minimum. Only 1 waiter was attending 4 tables. Its common in Dadar,no issues with that. Ordered Pav Bhaji, Masala Dosa & Stuff Parata. Pav Bhaji was good as always. Masala Dosa, bhaj was limited quantity. But worth the taste unfortunately same cannot be said of stuff parata. Mix vegetables were stuffed in Parata, but they were tasteless. Also bill was delivered while we were eating our food not good. This is the last time I will ever visit this place."
5,"The Staff was attentive and service was good .The food was delicious and Tasty.
The Villas are awesome.properly maintained Lawn. Must Visit the property"
1,"It's a Dance Bar, not suitable for a family dinner so kindly plan accordingly,"
4,"What do I say? It's a kind of Bar where drinks are served and orders are taken by waitresses. You get some live music and some Hindi filmi songs. I was taken there by my friend as I hate loud music as it is very noisy to my ears. Whether they have license or not, it's a question"
4,"Orchestra Dance bar, Artist is good, cotsly."
4,Amazing place.... must visit after 7:00 p.m....
5,"This small restaurant is located in Shindewadi area of Dadar East, in the shopping area. Had stepped in at evening tea time. Tried cutlet, methi bhaji and tea. Food was fresh and tasty. Prices were reasonable.

Service is good  and the place was clean. Not much by way of atmosphere. They have only very few tables and it looks like it gets crowded during peak meal times.

At the entrance, they had a display of Mangalore style snacks. It's a good place for a quick meal or snack while out shopping in the area."
5,Best places to visit recommended
5,"Had veg thali. 70 rs. Clean, hygienic, great taste. Sikandar sharbat and kokum sharbat were too sweet"
1,"Service is very bad they don't have manners to talk with customers
They don't have sense of talking with customer.
Very bad experience and not at all good place to eat
Food was not at all good taste"
5,"Great place to have poha upma idli medu wada and other breakfast items. The sambar and chutney are very good.

In evening you get Vada Pav, Samosa Pav and Cutlet Pav which very affordable and hygienic. Cutlet Pav surely deserves a mention.

You can also buy Chivda, Chakli and other quick snack items.

The place is small but very clean and the staff is friendly."
4,I placed an order for Burger and drink (non alcoholic strawberry bear). The Biryani's too good. So I tried something different this time. The burgers were nice. Fresh quality buns and good stuffing. 3.5/5
1,"I ordered just two items from Charcoal Eats through Zomato. The order was placed at exactly 2.00 pm. Delivery time showed 37 minutes. However, I received the delivery at 4.00 pm. The food was cold. Besides, the pickup time on the bill showed 2.22 pm. Then why was there so much of delay in delivery? Also, the bill amount is ‚Çπ588/- whereas ‚Çπ610.22 was deducted from my account. What happened to the remaining money? Though the amount is not a lot, I would still like an explanation for every payment."
1,"Used to love this place, my number 1 biryani in the city, however, quality is gone down 99% in recent months.
Lack of flavour, smaller portion sizes, cold food just all round abysmal. Such a shame to lose such great biryani."
5,"Charcoal eats is my go to place for Biryani now, especially after trying other places! This time I ordered vegetarian and vegan dishes like Dum Baked Jackfruit Biryani, Afghani Makhmali Vegetarian Biryani, Dum Baked Aloo and Corn Biyani, Smoked Paneer Makhani Rice bowl and Kathal Haleem. As always they are of high quality, right quantity and worth the price. It comes in sustainable packaging making it a guilt free takeout choice.
I have noticed that usually when I takeout from anywhere, Non vegetarian food tastes way better and I always take advantage of choosing it as I live in a vegetarian house. While the Non vegetarian menu is fantastic, the vegetarian and vegan dishes are equally good! Thats why for the first time ever, I was thrilled to just order the vegetarian and vegan variants and I had no FOMO!
Charcoal eats definitely proves ‚ÄòVeg biryani is not biryani‚Äô wrong! The Kathal Haleem is so creamy and imagine getting it all year round :O
Thank you for making such good Biryani and other dishes!"
5,"Nobody would deny to the fact that ""Charcoal eats"" serves some of the best variations of biryani in town.
I absolutely love their food and being weekend we wanted to relish in some of their new flavours that we haven't tried  so we ordered some & needless to say right from packaging to taste to quality everything was amazing.
This is what we all ordered
*Ustaadi hyderabadi mutton biryani - If you like spicy chatpata biryani then do try this, mutton pieces were very soft & tender.
*Makhmali afgani chicken tikka  biryani - Absolutely loved this, mild flavoured creamy biryani with juicy pieces of grilled chicken.
*Chicken baida mughlai paratha - paratha was stuffed generously with mince chicken and was done perfectly.
*Lucknowi seekh kebab - Ahh truly delicious! Melt in mouth and that mint curd chatni was perfect accompliment.
*Oh and also do not miss ordering the best danedaar and creamy phirni, one of the best.
*Vilayati chocolate mousse - Velvety texture with perfect balance of sweetness & that after taste of dark chocolate is fab.
Washed of everything with cranberry flavoured fruit beer.
Finally how can i forget the complementary junior chocolate panüòç
Our weekend was perfectly sorted with the scrumptious food by charcoal eats."
5,"Surprisingly superb place. Ambience and service was great. Plenty of choices like burgers, pastries, cakes etc available. Healthy Salads and drinks also available. We tried choux pastries, burgers, muffins etc and all were really tasty and awesome."
5,Most definitely one of my favourite cafes. It is an oasis in our chaotic city. The team is fantastic. The coffee is good. The chicken tikka here is simply the best and the sandwiches are always good. There is a great choice of food and breads. The desserts are also very very good. Every birthday cake that we have got from here has been fantastic.
5,"Excellent service, delicious food and pastries. Staff here is very professional, courteous and will go out of their way to put a smile on your face."
5,"Good Cafe at Hyatt, some great fresh bread, croissants and pastries."
5,"Excellent staff, experience and great pet friendly policy. Very grateful and blessed to be here with my Nutty. This is a must visit place for all pet parents.

special thanks to Mandira, Vaishnavi, Rajesh, Grishma, chef Yogesh, their boss- Mr Nibu Mathew for making Nutty very comfortable!!!

Many thanks"
2,"We ordered a triple Schezwan fried rice, but what we received was far from what we expected. There was no taste resembling fried rice, despite specifically asking them not to include egg. They insisted that egg is mixed into the dish and couldn‚Äôt be avoided. Aside from the egg issue, the dish didn‚Äôt match the usual fried rice flavor or texture‚Äîit was just colorful with no substance. The gravy was disappointing too‚Äîfilled with long, stringy vegetables and barely any chicken. Unfortunately, this is not the quality I associate with New Shanghai. I didn‚Äôt expect my dinner to turn out this way, leaving my mood ruined and the food barely eaten."
5,"Awesome food at a reasonable cost.
Their chicken crispy and chicken combination rice is a must try.
A very well managed staff with good quality food.
The way they present their dish is quite amazing."
3,"Found this New Shanghai restaurant on Zomato and ordered, where they serve Indo Chinese cuisine. The delivery was quick and on time. The food arrived extremely hot. The quantity was extremely good and the quality was also decent. I haven't visited the outlet to comment on the ambiance and staff.

This is what I tried in my online order:

1. Veg Triple schezwan rice:
3*/5
The schezwan rice was cooked well and it was very tasty. The veg gravy had all the veggies and it was tasty too. The only thing was that I found the gravy to be extremely spicy otherwise it was a very good dish.

2. Veg Flat Malaysian Noodles:
4*/5
This was very tasty the flat Malaysian noodles was cooked to perfection,it was stir fried and tossed with garlic, sprouts and spinach. Recommended if you like Malaysian noodles.

They also gave extra schezwan sauces and fried noodles both were very good. Fried noodles were nice and crisp.

My Experience

Delivery: On time
Food taste: Good
Quantity: Excellent
Quality: Good
Cuisine: Indo Chinese
Price: Inexpensive to Moderate
Service: Good
Overall value for money is actually 3.5* to 4*/5 but because the triple schezwan gravy was too spicy for my taste buds giving it a 3*/5."
1,Waste of money Very less Quantity nd Tasteless food we ordered Chicken lollypop and Chicken triple rice nd there's no chicken in triple rice nd chicken lollipop picece too small nd they charged too High price for pathetic food and we call the manager to Suggest and discussed things because we're also from hotel industry but even Manager don't know how to talk with guest very bad experience I have...
5,"The best place to enjoy Chinese food ‚Ä¶.. literally been there more then 50
times ‚Ä¶."
4,"Tiffany's Restaurant is an excellent dining spot with a welcoming and warm atmosphere.

The staff is extremely kind, helpful, and ensures a great experience for every guest.

The food is delicious, well-prepared, and offers a variety of options to suit all tastes. The interior is clean, well-maintained, and adds to the pleasant dining experience.

It‚Äôs the perfect location for hosting a party or enjoying a cozy dinner with family and friends. Overall, a fantastic restaurant that I highly recommend!"
5,Good place to hang up with friends and family.... Food is really good and all employees are very polite with their behaviour.... one plus point is that tiffany resto bar very near to station
3,"Though the place is good for food and service, we had a very noisy crowd ruining our lunch atmosphere. Suggest the restaurant has a separate enclosure for such large parties. Other diners cannot enjoy their food. Will never visit again."
5,"A mainstay near Santacruz Station. Still doing absolutely good. Food is stilly yummy and always drives home. Hyderabadi Biryani, Chicken Baghdadi, Butter Garlic Naan, Tiffany Special kebab were really good"
5,"To expect the unexpected so I called this place as unexpected restaurant. This place is right at the bus station busy crowded, smelly and trash everywhere which is in slum area in Mumbai. So I wasn‚Äôt expect that will find this kind of restaurant in such place. They have all types of food Indian, Chinese and Arabian foods. Delicious foods. This was my fourth time here and I always came here for Thai green curry and naan those are so yummy.
Of course staff are so helpful and offers a great service.
So come and have a try highly recommended."

With peppy numbers and not-so-expensive booze, this place is pretty chill for a hangout with friends. In case you find it difficult to locate it, it's right beside three wise monkeys and the habitat."
5,Awesome place. Definitely go for their cocktails. Good music. Nice place for English Prem matches. Fast service. Tasty food! Pocket friendly rates. Loved it ‚ù§Ô∏è
1,Please do not visit here they are complete frauds. Typical of most cheap bars where they replace ur drink with a cheaper variant of what you have ordered. We ordered x and got a cheap y drink when we confirmed they flatly denied and said we don't do this as walked away.... Usually bars do this if u order like ur 4-5 drink these idiots did it on our second. We ordered the same brand again and there was a clear marked noticeable difference in taste and they flatly refused. So please avoid there are a ton of places on the same street....
5,"This cozy little bar is a decent place to grab a few drinks with friends (it wont put a big hole in your pocket). Not a typical club club of sorts but a good place to chill with drinks and scintillating conversations. The service at time gets a bit spotty but a couple of reminders to the waiter shall just do the job. The food is good just as you'd expect from a teeny lil bar. Like said, the drinks are not very pricey, so drink up, lads."
5,I have been to this place  nice ambiance drinks prices r reasonable compare to other club's food is good and reasonable on Saturday it's jam packed this place is just next to khar railway station on the west side  the dj here play's good music both Hollywood and bollywood do try this place üëç
1,"I had a terrible experience staying at this hotel. It was nothing like what was promised during the booking process.

Misleading Room Photos: The room we were given was completely different from the one shown during the booking. This felt like a bait-and-switch tactic.
Hygiene Issues: The washroom was in a horrible state with ashes from cigarettes left behind.
Maintenance Problems: There was no mat outside the washroom, and water was leaking out, making the floor messy and slippery.
Cleanliness: The bedsheets looked like they hadn‚Äôt been washed or changed at all.
Overall, this was one of the worst experiences I‚Äôve had in a hotel. It needs significant improvements in cleanliness, maintenance, and transparency. I would not recommend this place to anyone."
4,Enjoying a delicious meal is a true pleasure.  The aromas and flavors can bring immense satisfaction. Sharing a meal with loved ones creates cherished memories.  Food nourishes our bodies and provides energy for our daily activities. Taking the time to savor each bite enhances the dining experience.
5,"This is a place for events like the live comedy nights. The Habitat under used for comedy has been completely renovated into a very attractive venue for comedy and tempting for drinks on the go. Adding the updated pics below

I visited today for the live telecast and recording of the World Chess Championship. The upper hall was the Studio with Enthusiasts watching in the crowd Chess tables to play and food. Great experience for Chess lovers"
1,"Had a terrible experience talking to the person answering the calls (female). She is extremely rude.
Made a mistake and booked the 10pm show by mistake in place of the 8pm show (realised it as soon as I booked it). I understand if it can't be accommodated but she was so rude in the way she spoke to us and she basically said - I don't care, your mistake you rebook and come the right show"
5,"Went there to attend the comedy line up at below the Habitat.
It's a small, cozy, neat place with decent interiors. The comedy line up was above average, and the service, impeccable."
5,"‚ö´U TURN - THE LOUNGE ‚óè
LOCATION - This resto bar can be easily located and it is at a 10 mins walking distance from khar railway station.
AMBIENCE-
With a lovely welcoming entrance this sports bar has an indoor as well as an outdoor seating at 4th floor with a super comfortable seating sofa-beds with a rooftop view which looks much pleasing and amazing in evening lights. They also have a bar section.

STAFF & SERVICE-
The service staff was much kind, well mannered , trained and courteous and helped us ordering the best dishes of the restaurant. Thanks to Ashok who attended us so well for the day. They have live sports screening. Staff was attentive as well and maintained the warm, calm environment. The service was prompt.

FOOD-
No doubt the food is remarkable in taste, quality as well as quantity.

OUR ORDERS-

BEVERAGES-
Flavoured Caprioska - A perfect mixture of cranberry juice , lemon and mint leaves. Totally loved this drink and is worth ordering and a must try mocktail.
Tequila Sunrise- Basically a tequila based cocktails with orange juice twist. This drink went well with the food we ordered.

STARTERS-
Bang Bang Chicken - This droolworthy dish had a nice mouth watering taste. The chicken was well marinated and tandoored to perfection.
Kung Pao Potatoes- A perfect Chinese starter for potato lovers. Potatoes were super soft and juicy stir fried in luscious chilly soya sauce.

MAIN COURSE-
Paneer Lababdar with Butter Garlic naan - This most ordered dish of the restaurant is a minimum spicy dish made in creamy gravy which went well with the naan which was perfectly made. Paneer could have been much softer otherwise it's a must try dish. The quantity is good for 2 people.

DESSERTS-
Brownie with Icecream- Hot Brownie topped with chilled vanilla Ice Cream is a perfect dessert to end with! The brownie was super good, melt in mouth with walnuts within. This could be called the best one from our order for the day.

Overall it was an amazing experience. Its a place serving continental , north indian Cuisine worth a try.I would suggest one to visit here at least one time for an amazing experience. Especially this place is highly recommended for hookah/sheesha lovers.

Sheesha is also available for all sheesha lovers..
Ambiance is the best thing which will attract you towards this restaurant..

They have the best service as they were so kind and polite.
Everything was on proper time with good timely service..
All the staff members were very helpful as they were helping me to click the pictures..

Food was one of the best thing happened last night specially that chilli mushroom...
We had a variety of food but the special one was mushroom chilli with Margarita..it was insane i never had this mushroom anywhere... Special thanks to the chef of U TURN.

We had
1)Bang Bang Chicken -
It was a boneless tandoori Chicken with extra spicy... Chicken was very good and it was tender from inside...that juicy flavour of tandoori was the best thing in this with green chutney it was much more delicious.

2)Chilli Mushroom
Highly recommended
This was the best thing of this place...
Everyone should try this...it taste like some sort of mushroom popcorn which has a Chinese flavour...one of the finest starter i had here.

3)Burnt Garlic Rice
Huge quantity of chicken rice bowl....price range was very good..
It was for almost 4 to 5 people bt we were only 2 of them..
Quality of rice was very good and chicken chunks were enough in it..

4)Orange Margarita
It was a good cocktail..fresh mint and the cranberry gave a complete taste...
Very smooth and the rock salt on the glass was giving a unique taste in every sip..
Presentation was very good..

Best place alert in khar west.
Service was very good from all the staff."
5,"Been here yesterday for lunch with my mates to munch on some food.
U turn is a sports bar having pretty much well put decor for a sports bar. The place has good decor and has that raw feel to it which is simply amazing.
Taking about the f&b it was pretty much good. In drinks we had Long Island iced tea which was mix of several spirits and topped with coke which resulted to a great drink indeed. In mocktails we had fruit punch which was a mix of fruits and vanilla mix , lovely drink to sip on if you don‚Äôt consume alcohol.
In appetizers we had bhatti da Murgh and Murgh tandoori wings ; both the appetizers were made to perfection. Evenly cooked and it had that aromatic flavor to it. Bhatti da Murgh was my favorite as it had that coal effect on it.
In mains we opted for naan and Murgh angaarey. Spicy and perfectly thickened gravy having generous chicken portions in it was splendid and we also tried their chicken tikka Biryani which was my personal favorite! The taste was pretty good and the aroma was mind bogglingly awesome. Loved the portion size they serve which is really a great thing about this place. They also follow all the safety protocols during these times which is again a huge plus.

Loved the hospitality delivered and the f&b sector is also well put all together!"
5,"U-Turn which Is located inside a building on the 4th floor has both outside and indoor sitting arrangement. The outside is very spacious and eye-appealing whereas the inside is quiet and dark but perfect for a night get together with pals.

Coming to the food, my experience was okayish with the food. The food which I happened to try was a chicken lollipop and chicken flamingo. The quantity of the food was great and the quality could have been a bit better. Chicken flamingo in which the pieces were used as a pocket for spinach, broccoli and mushroom stuffing served with an appetising sauce.
In mains, I happened to pair the triple chicken fried rice with man chow soup. In all the dishes I kinda found the chicken a bit stale so I didn't finish it in whole but my partner liked it, so I guess my taste buds were working fine.üò£

The mocktails are better than cocktails there and while watching any match inside one can always opt for sheesha.

The dessert was perfect, a chocolate brownie topped with a vanilla scoop to make the visit worthwhile.

Ambience -5/5
Value-4/5
‚ÄåFood-3.5/5"
3,"We decided to visit this place for dinner. The restaurant is located on the fourth floor. There was live screening of the Premier League going on, they even screen cricket games. There is alcohol and sheesha available too.

There is loud music so you surely need to be louder than that if you want to have a conversation. The music was good though so not a bad experience. Taking you through a list of all the food items we had ‚¨áÔ∏è

Chicken Tikka

Marinated chicken grilled with wholesome spices. Quite succulent and tasty.

Loaded Nachos

Nicely baked tortilla chips topped with refried beans, black beans, corn kernels, guacamole, Jalapeno, sour cream, tomato salsa and melted cheese. The taste of which is absolutely amazing.

Fries With Cheese Sauce

French fries served with cheese sauce. You can order the cheese sauce separately here or have it poured upon the fries.

Cheese Garlic Bread

The cheesy garlic bread was bursting with flavours.

Jalapeno Cheese Poppers

Delicious small balls that are crispy outside and consist of filling and cheesy inside. Was a really good appetizer.

Butter Garlic Prawns

As expected the quantity was less, but the taste was lip smacking.

Desi Burrito Bowl (Recommended)

The quantity as you can look in the pictures is just amazing. The taste was also spectacular. Tandoori grilled chicken with dips and mexican rice. They also have an option of paneer for the vegetarians.

For drinks, we tried Fresh Lime soda and Peach Iced Tea (one of the best we've had).

Overall, we had a fantastic time and the place had some really splendor vibes. So if you're planning to have some fun dinner with your friends, then this is the perfect place."
4,"This place has been around for a while but I finally decided to just give a quick review. If you're looking for a decently priced bar with nice food, decent crowd,  and affordable alcohol, then head over here.
They had a funny moment where they confused our two separate gin quarters for each other but we didn't mind, had a good laugh over it. Dan our server for the night was super helpful and polite.
Try their chicken ghee roast, while it's too oily as you can see in the picture, it doesn't compromise on the taste at all.
Their kolhapuri hummus was also quite smooth and tasty, worth a shot.  Egg ghee roast tasted good even though I prefer the chicken.
Inside of the bar looks awesome but we still preferred the seating outside, it's nice."
4,"Good food.
Nice ambience..
Amazing deals in happy hours
Ordered chicken sizzlers and pizza.
Portions size are good too.
Bit slow service"
4,"I recently visited this spot for a football match screening, and it‚Äôs definitely the place to be if you're a Manchester United fan! For fans of other teams, they do have screenings, but the energy might not be as high. As for the food, the nachos were a bit underwhelming, but the aglio olio spaghetti was a pleasant surprise. If you're into strong drinks, the espresso martini is a must-try ‚Äî a great blend of coffee and alcohol. Parking can be tricky, but since it‚Äôs a short walk from Khar station, it‚Äôs a good excuse to skip the hassle and avoid drinking and driving."
5,Great place to grab a beer and get out of the heat - my 2nd one was on the house!
3,"Decent place to hangout once in a while and have some drinks and food. A little on the expensive side if there are only 2 or 3 people, but good for big groups. Music could have been better, especially the live band.
The Long island iced tea seemed bomb as my friend's got pretty high.
The four cheese pizza was okay, chicken satay was decent. The Jack Daniels chicken wings were something different for a change.
The pasta and the sizzlers were amazing. I would definitely go back for the food.
Good ambience.
Overall a decent experience."
5,"I was recently introduced to authentic Sindhi food and I have to admit it‚Äôs one of the tastiest delicacies in the list of our Indian cuisines. Not many people are fond of it, cos you hardly have restaurants serving authentic, traditional dishes. But once you get to taste the original varieties you will be highly amazed.
I had a pop up event to attend @ khar and I met some good set of foodie friends over there who were equally excited like me to try out this outlet at khar. As I regularly visit the Lower Parel outlet I was damn sure that my friends would love their food. And as expected warm welcome, fabulous staff and amazing Sindhi menu to choose from.

We ordered:
üîπBeejiya di Tikki - Unique combination of lotus stem along with potatoes tasted so good, not to forget the crispy tangy fritter of lotus stem on top adds to the crunch of this soft tikkis.Highly recommendedüëç
üîπKachari- Ab Sindhi restaurant aye aur papad nahi try kiya toh kya kiya?
Well this Modak shaped yummy papad made out of soaked rice is a must try. Highly recommended üëç
üîπSindhi Pani Puri - So the puris are not crunchy but rather khasta and believe me they literally melt in your mouth and the beautiful flavour of masaledaar aloo stuffing along with sweet and spicy chutney is too good.
üîπChole Pattice - I wonder why I never tried this dish from their menu. It was our absolute favourite and we ordered for 2 more plates. So basically it was crunchy aloo pattice which was stuffed with spicy Chana dal and served along with perfectly cooked mildly spiced chole which balanced the flavour beautifully, accompanied with pav and green chutney to adjust the spice level as per your liking. Highly recommended üëç
üîπSindhi Thali - The complete packageüòúüòú
Cos you get to taste so many varieties on a go.
I personally love the combination of bhuga chawal with Sindhi curry and sai bhaji with paratha.
üîπSev Mithai - Do not leave this place without having their master piece.. Trust me it‚Äôs one of the best loaded with ghee and mawa. Highly recommended üëç
üîπPan Milkshake - Nice and nutty paan flavour, served absolutely chilled.

Overall my girls were super happy as they all stay nearby and thanked me for introducing‚Äù Juss by sindhful ‚Äú to them üòç"
1,"Another good restaurant lost to greed. Quality has dropped significantly. Portion sizes smaller. Rolls have become oily. Absolutely poor experience now.

Should shut shop now instead of swindling money from customers."
5,"This place is surely one of the best in Mumbai. Simple, authentic regional Indian food prepared using good quality ingredients seems to be their mantra and surely it's working well. Bheeyan ji tikki, Sai bhaji, Sindhi curry, singhar ji mithai are highly recommended here. Do not miss out on this place."
5,"Here's an outlet for authentic sindhi food & pure vegans. Our attendant Kuldeep's service was very nice. The staff members were polite and welcoming. It's nearby by Khar station, it  hardly takes 5mins to reach. The ambience is attractive. They have two floors seating section. The wall is painted beautifully with large frame of women in beautiful Indian attire, one side of the wall is full of bronze plates hanging all over the wall and scripts in hindi language, as we go ahead the wall is fully painted it's so beautiful with floral paintings and they have wooden tables, chairs which are very comfortable to seat.

Coming to the food :

In Mocktails (PE-PE-PE) :

Paan Milkshake : This was served in a bottle. The flavour of paan was just heaven. The first sip i took made me feel so refreshed, that i completed this shake in no time.

Mango Lassi : This was also served in a bottle. A mandatory drink in summers. It was tempting and nice as always.

In Appetizers (NASTO) :

Chola Dabla : It was mixture of pav, chole and chat. It was topped with spicy chutneys and curd. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

In Main Course (KHADO) :

Peeli Dal, Bhindi Basar, Steamed Rice And Phulkas :

It was the best combo meal. The best peeli dal I have ever ate, really authentic and delicious in taste. Bhindi basar was the basic bhindi cooked with tomatoes, it also tasted delicious.

Veg Sindhi Thali :

Here before they use you provide unlimited Thali but now they have changed it & keep it as limited one. And if you want you can add Sai Bhaji or Bhuga Chawal but for this you have to pay extra. Also there is option in between 2 Phulkas or 3 Pooris. This thali is really huge. The thali contains about 12 items and each one of the dishes were incredibly delicious. It has.

Aloo Tuk (2pcs)
Sindhi Curry
Paneer Makhani
Bhee Aloo Sabzi
Sai Bhaji
Bhuga Chawal
Steam Rice
2 Phulkas and 2 Pooris
Masala Chass
Kheecha Papad
Boondi Raita
Meetha Lola

In Dessert (KUCH MEETHO) :

Singhar Ji Mithai : This one is our favourite of the lot. And we will go back here just to have this dessert. It was made of sev & milk. It had a little gulkand taste and topped with some almonds. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Overall a good place, totally worth it. Must visit this place."
5,"I‚Äôm a sindhi and I was looking for someplace very authentic in sindhi taste when I was recommended Juss by sindhful. Juss in sindhi translates to magic, so this was my most awaited!
The food was heavenly. It was typically like ‚Äúghar ka khaana‚Äù, served really hot and with just the right amount of spices. Oil was minimal and the food was just perfectly cooked. The staff was very helpful and courteous, the the ambiance was very very transitional. I loved every moment I spent there."
4,"We have tried a lot from the menu, on Saturday afternoon. We ordered a chicken platter, some were delicious while some were okayish. Mocktails are okayish. Pizza was amazing!! The pahadi chicken was good.  And then of course the dessert, it was sooooo good that we had to repeat it.

The ambiance is rustic. We felt our table lacked lights. They also have outdoor seating. It was a match day so of course the match was going on along with preparation for the night event.

The service was a bit slow but the server was really impressive with his suggestions, one extra star for him!

A good playful vibe, can try!"
2,"The service here is extremely poor. The waitstaff seriously need training in basic customer service. When asked about the menu, they respond with an attitude, simply telling customers to check the app or scanner. Yet, even after placing an order, we were twice informed that certain items were unavailable.

The food is decent but lacks essentials‚Äîno dips served with wings or burgers. Portions are also noticeably small, likely to make the menu seem more ‚Äúexclusive.‚Äù

Service Charge: They automatically add a 10% tip, which they absolutely do not deserve. We requested its removal, and they complied. If they refuse, don‚Äôt hesitate to call the authorities.

Would not recommend this place based on service alone."
4,"This vibrant establishment offers a delightful dining experience with its energetic atmosphere.  The menu boasts a selection of incredibly tasty dishes, all offered at very reasonable prices.  Every bite is a burst of flavor, showcasing fresh ingredients and culinary expertise.  The ambiance is truly captivating, creating a warm and inviting space for any occasion. Their non alcoholic beverages were a blast. I especially recommend their spiced guavava juice. The service was slightly slow, especially for Indian thali. Their chinese thali was great tasting and covered a variety of different elements. I highly recommend experiencing this gem for yourself."
2,"Social is generally known for its reliable food, lively atmosphere, and enjoyable outings with friends. However, my recent visit to the Khar location unfortunately fell short of expectations. The quality of the food was disappointing across the board, with several dishes falling flat. I suspect the chicken may have been stale, as it didn't taste fresh. Overall, it was a subpar experience."
5,"Khar Social is really a cool social place to catch up with friends over your favourite drink. Good place, good vibes, good ambience and of course good food. They are known for their finger food, chakna with a twist. More than indulgence it's an experience which you will cherish.
You can book in advance as the bar is normally crowded in the evening. Lot of waiting in case of the weekend. So make sure you plan in time. Rates are high but justify the food, ambience, service.
We had beer with fries, cheese chilli toast, burger, pizza and pasta. Everything was good but it takes time after you order so keep your order ready in advance. But when you are having good company, you won't mind that."
5,"Dropped in here for dinner, and was not disappointed. Excellent food, particularly the seafood variety, strong drinks (the way I like it), most polite and courteous staff, lovely ambience too. Be it a family outing or a get together with friends, you can't go wrong with Oh Calcutta! Highly recommended!!"
5,"This is probably one of the best if not the best for Bengali Cuisine.  I find this branch of Oh! Calcutta which is their flagship branch as much better that their other branches.  The food is done very well, the staff is extremely courteous and helpful and I have been a regular visitor here for long.  So whenever I miss Kolkata, I drop in."
5,"Truly amazing food. Staffs are helping.reflect the tradition and culture of kolkata in food in ambiance.

Must try bhetki fry fish and grean chicken also you will love the Luchi."
4,"Great place to have authentic Bengali cuisine. Lived th fish fry and Bhetki Patodi. Had mutton kosha mangsho and luchi for the main course, tastes good but isn't as spicy as I was expecting. One large plate of both is enough for two people. Tried the watermelon and mango based mocktails too. It's a little heavy on the pocket but expected for fine dining."
5,"Wanna enjoy some Bengali delicacies?
Oh! Calcutta welcomes you

Good ambience with melodious Bengali music.
It usually takes some time for them to serve, so if anybody wants to enjoy the dish throughly, make it on a weekend and make sure to book your table in advance.

P.S - Do not miss their desserts and Bengali paan after finishing up your lunch / dinner"
4,"Rajasthan is a delightful restaurant for authentic Mughlai cuisine. The butter chicken is exceptional, with a rich, creamy texture and perfectly balanced spices. The tandoori dishes are smoky and grilled to perfection, while the biryani is aromatic and flavorful, making it a must-try.

The restaurant accepts UPI and cash payments, but cards are not accepted. Parking during the daytime can be challenging due to limited availability, so visiting during off-peak hours is advisable.

Although the waiter‚Äôs name is not remembered, the staff was attentive and ensured a smooth dining experience. The ambiance complements the flavorful dishes, making it an ideal spot for a hearty Mughlai meal. Highly recommended!"
4,"A restaurant which is running full for so many years must be good right. Good value for money place. Eat mughlai only. You will get flavourful masala only, little meat you have to search hard to find."
3,"Ordered mutton kabsa they put excess oil on my food, furthermore we also ordered chicken tandoori and chicken tikka but the taste was not good and the staff was not attentive. The service was really bad."
3,"Food is definitely wonderful, but just for non-vegetarians. If you are a vegetarian, you should avoid going since the moment you enter the room, it will smell like non-vegetarian cuisines, and even if you are in a non-vegetarian restaurant, you can't be sure your veg meal is prepared purely .the wash basin is dirty and stinky .."
5,"Very old Restaurant adds to the goodwill of this place. The waiters and staff are excellent and very polite, willing to help and assist in your orders. Large tables to sit comfortably and no pushing around to move out quickly since there's a crowd waiting outside. About food what to say, they are continuing their goodwill for more than 50 years. No compromise on quality yet rates are a third less than other restaurants. The AC is fine and cool not too chill either."
5,"I booked this dinning experience via Zomato on eve of my sister's birthday . We had an amazing time and scrumptious food indeed. An array of options for vegetarians, they have a buffets on the weekends and luncheons which I am keen to try on. For the dinner we gorged on, chicken Burmese khow sue soup, manchow veg soup, mutton seekh kebab biryani was the star of the night , paneer jaipuri , roti basket and dal makhani . Quantity vs quality of the food is a 10 on 10, service is slow but bearable. Ambience is decent and peaceful . Highly recommended if you are willing to spend a family time ."
5,"I would like to provide a feedback for Arun at the restaurant.
He was extremely kind and polite. I've been to many hotels, but sometimes they lack that personal touch. I was slightly late for breakfast, but sir ensured that I was well fed. Also asked about how I was doing how overall is my experience at the hotel, is there any issues whatsoever. Kindly pass my regards to him. Wish him the best."
5,"Soul Restaurant is a wonderful place to enjoy delicious buffet food. We visited the restaurant with Arun Sir, Prem, and Rahul, and it was a great experience. The buffet had so many options, including starters, main courses, and desserts. Everything was fresh, tasty, and well-prepared.

The staff was very kind and helpful. They made sure our plates were always full and served with a smile. The restaurant was clean and had a peaceful atmosphere, which made our meal even better. Arun Sir enjoyed the variety of dishes, Prem loved the pasta, and Rahul couldn‚Äôt get enough of the desserts.

If you are looking for a place with amazing buffet food and excellent service, Soul Restaurant is the best choice. We will definitely come back again!"
5,"I had breakfast here daily during my stay, and each morning was a treat. The food was consistently good, and the service was exceptional. A special shout-out to Arun, whose warm hospitality made my experience truly memorable. He went the extra mile to create a perfect meal for me, and I'm so grateful for his kindness."
5,"Soul, the amazing restaurant & bar is located at Oriental Residency- Bandra. They serve Indian, Continental and Asean cuisines in an elegant and comfortable ambiance.

From appetizers to desserts, every dish is crafted to perfection. We tried some of their signature recipes and were delighted with flavors, taste and presentation.The food served were exquisite, perfectly balanced with flavors and were scrumptious. We tried:
‚ô¶Ô∏èCream of Mushroom
‚ô¶Ô∏èPomfret Tandoori
‚ô¶Ô∏èRawas Tikka
‚ô¶Ô∏èMalaysian Prawns
‚ô¶Ô∏èNaram Dil ke kebab
‚ô¶Ô∏èFruit Salad with Ice cream
‚ô¶Ô∏èCarmel Custard
‚ô¶Ô∏èCheese Cake

The drinks were equally unique and refreshing. The bar menu features a wide range of cocktails, mocktails and the choicest of spirits. We tried:
‚ô¶Ô∏èPeachy Twister
‚ô¶Ô∏èMelon Bliss
‚ô¶Ô∏èBerry Twist

The staff is courteous, polite and knowledgeable. Their services are excellent and could be one of the best in and around Bandra. Chef Mr. Rajveer was courteous to check the quality of food served. Miss Ashwini offered us to try the best with pride.

Do drop in for a casual meal, or for a special gathering, Soul‚Äôs food and drink will always elevate the dining experience."

5,"This restaurant in Khar has a new breakfast menu that you just can‚Äôt miss! Only Parathas has been a favourite of the city for its North Indian food since 2001. It is also super pretty, with its golden lighting and both indoor and outdoor space. Apart from the chai and coffee that is on the house, their Sunday breakfast menu has North Indian favourites like the Chhole Bhature, with its round and perfect bhature, the sweet Lassi in a kulhad, a veggie sandwich for those who prefer lighter foods and of course the highlight this restaurant is famous for: the Nawaabi Parathe filled with paneer and cheese. This exclusive menu is available every Sunday from 8 AM to 11:55 AM so check it out now!"
3,"Didn't quite relish the experience or the food here...
Ambience was ok
Service was just basic
Food was a let down üëé - I thot chole bature would be an apt choice... But they give chana masala instead of chole... üò≥
What's the bestseller - they said masala variant...
It wasnt masala in chole but they added some masala in Bature (like cheese spread)- didn't enjoy at all

Saving grace was lassi..  it was nice

Maybe everyone to their own tastebuds.."
5,"We were staying just up the road in a hostel, and went wandering looking for some dinner. Really lovely parathas, smile with a service. Helped us understand different options on the menu and didn‚Äôt oversell us anything. Happily would go back, and was full locals too so highly recommended"
4,"Great ambiance and service. The tamarind chutney served with kulcha is simply amazing with perfect taste balance. But if you wish to have spicy food, let your server know before."
5,A slice of punjab in mumbai serving the best north indian food and chaats in mumbai. eEverything is pure veg and made in desi ghee. You should definitely visit only parathas with your gang and their spacious seating perfect for  gatherings
4,"Good lounge bar.

Friday night had live music band.

The staff is attentive and prompt.

The bar menu is limited but handful and tasty.

Recommended..!"
4,"Visited with friends on Friday night, and was asked if we have a booking. So suggest to book in advance on weekends, although we were seated in the open area. The AC section is small and has live singers on guitar with Bollywood numbers after 10 pm. Most of the crowd comes after 10 pm but the obscene Rs 25k per table in AC section, was a damper. So post 11pm we headed inside beside the bar area and enjoyed fully. Food quantity is sufficient for two and served hot. Taste of all items was good. Beware of the 10% Service Charge although service was fast and plates changed by the waiter after 2 starters. One more damper was that, no Old Monk Rum although on the Menu and no Budweiser or Tuborg in Beer Menu.
The outside area is covered but still parallel to the footpath hence not surprising to see a üêÄ disappearing into the pantry. One more drawback was the single washroom, way back outside the pub, seemingly inside a different establishment.
But overall liked the place."
4,"Rocking night club which plays bollywood music till 2am! Starts around 10 pm. To reserve a table you need to pay INR 25k for a table of 6 which includes cover charge. You can also opt to go there before the crowds, order delicious food and they may allow you sit on the table till the reserved guests come. You can come in later and just stand and dance an pay only for what you eat and drink. Sunday is retro night here.. and they play all genres of songs and you can dance the night away! The biggest drawback is the ac section also allows smoking..so with the crowd and half of them smoking, you kinda feel dizzy by the end of it. Music is awesome.. mutton kheema pizza was  mindblowing..not had such awesome pizza in years!!! Chicken lasooni tikka was tender and yumm..chicken chilly was good too..the malavika style kochi prawns were bland and had nothing like kerala cuisine in them! The other dishes more than made up for the prawns..I found it reasonably priced given that it was in Khar West.. definitely go here with friends who enjoy shaking a leg To retro bollywood music and have the time of your life!"
4,Nice place to hang out with friends. Great drinks and a very nice choice of starters. Their pizzas are awesome. Great music. The outside area is really chilled. Place is expensive
5,"Have been to this place for the first time with my friends and we had a great time. The ambience is cozy and nice.. The food was delicious. Ordered Coriander Lemon Pesto Pasta with chicken, totally loved it. We also ordered Lasooni Chicken Kebab and it was just fab!!! The chicken was tender, buttery and juicy. It just melted in our mouths. Mmmm, it was flavorsome. Paneer Tikka was awesome.. right amount of spice, it was nicely cooked. The salad was light and delicious. Only thing that didn't go well was the cost of the water bottle. They had Malaki Alkaline water in store. The MRP was Rs. 110 per bottle (1L) and they charged us Rs. 150 for it. The bottle looks very stylish and cool but it doesn't make water taste any better.
Irrespective of that, I would recommend this place to everyone."
1,Food was pathetic. Service was lousy. There was hardly any crowd today afternoon. They made us stand in a line and then after 15 min the person tells us come to the other counter which had few people. KFC food quality has really deteriorated. The french fries were thin and tiny. The chicken burger was really a small dry burger with no taste. The lady who was cleaning the seating area was definitely a frustrated person who made a point to make screeching noise of furniture and dragging and banging furniture while cleaning. No peace while eating. Would never go back there or even order from KFC
1,"Worst food and service too.
Spent 324.00
Got full of oily chiken .
After placing the order staff was doing some other things instead of delivering the order.
No taste store manager was not available to respond.
Other staff is not entertaining for any complaints."
1,Ordered takeaway for 10pc bucket along with French fries and buns. When opened  bag french fries were missing from the parcel. KFC Charged me for an item which they did not pack it. This is how you treat your customers ?
3,"Tried kfc after a really long time now. We ordered
Chicken popcorn and hot and crispy chicken.
Coming to the crispy chicken, was filling, better quantity but when you eat the outer covering, the chicken inside is plain n doesn't have any flavour in it and it also smells like  raw chicken, the smell that comes when chicken isn't washed or cleaned properly.
Popcorn was good in taste as always but the quantity should have been more as it was for ‚Çπ150, quantity seemed very less but has good taste. One more thing the chicken doesn't taste well when it becomes cold
1) chicken popcorn ( medium size ) - 4/5
2) hot and crispy chicken ( 10 pcs ) - 3/5"
1,"Awww what's that in my chicken. Look at my photos, you'll see. Disappointed if you compare with all the other burger restaurants in the surrounding of Linking Road. They don't have too many choices. I must admit their services are good, clean and enough spaces on the 1st floor."
1,I am regular visitor at bandra juhu and  bsc the staff keep on changing and so the staff.... Asked one of the djs why the quality of the music changing and why the staff change... Reply by the staff we don't get paid salarys in time from here... There is salary delay for 2 month staff wait to get paid ... The have all the money to promote and invest and  invite all outside djs but current staff is not paid ... I think we should not let this happen in humanitarian ground S because all who work have families and responsibilities but are not getting paid... Nonone should vist such places where the staff suffers
5,Totally random visit on a Thursday night!! We enjoyed the ambiance and the experience. The food was great and the drinks were amazing. I'd definitely visit again and would recommend going here for a fun-filled evening hangout.
1,"Be very careful when you‚Äôre paying the bill, the staff assumes you are drunk and charges the card higher than the bill amount. This happened to me last night - and when I confronted the staff, he returned the overcharged money as cash!! I had good sense to cross check the bill and the debit message as I was not given the charge slip."
5,"I visited this place with my cousin and friend. It's quite spacious with three different sitting arrangement. Two on the outer sides and one which is inside and air conditioned. The music is simply amazing. I am not even the last person tap my feet on music, but I ended up doing it here. The staff is polite and friendly. We ordered for drinks and starters which was pretty good. A nice ambience and atmosphere which attracts you to this place. Well suggested place to spend time with family and friends."
1,"I have been going here for years. Have had 2 of my bday parties here. Have had get togethers here. Went here on 28 Feb after a long time and literally got robbed by the staff.
While paying the bill by card , I gave the waiter 500 rs note to get me change as I needed it for taxi.
He comes back and gives me 100 rs change saying that I only gave him 100 rs note.
That led to an argument. The cashier , a bald guy, got verbally aggressive.i asked them to check the cctv camera but they refused. After that I left.
The waiter who was responsible was being annoying all the time we were there insisting that we buy a whole bottle of whiskey,instead of individual drinks.
Later I found out thar they now pay girls commission to get customers to the bar.
It's sad. I have had lots of fun memories here. But this one bad experience overshadows all that.
It's hard to believe that a bar like BSE could hire such people and stoop to such levels.
Never again going there !!!"
4,"Huge buffet spread, and you can get spoilt for choice! The ambience was amazing, with well spaced out tables.

Had an enjoyable evening with close friends!

They have parking too!

Highly recommended place for all foodies!"
5,"One of the best places in mumbai to have Buffet.
They have amazing spread with well crafted food and assorted choice.
The best is the sushi counter and live counter.
they have systematic arrangement and various seating which is really beautiful.
The place can surely handle many people at a time and serve well.
The live counters can take time to prepare but well one can indulge in the sushi dishes too.
Cold drinks are offered as unlimited choice , and they do server alcohol during evening dinner.
Indian food is available too, but come one there's about 20+ dishes to select from Continental food.
The price is very much same everyday . Do try to avail zomato take booking which will make it value for money.
Make sure to visit early as they are very perfect on time and will make sure to close live counter at stipulated time.

The staff is really helpful and can handle during peak hours too
Valet parking available but it cost Rs 80.
The place do gets crowded during peak hours
Make sure you book your table prior that the best
Overall had a great experience at this  place and will surely visit soon."
4,"I really Loved the spread of Sushis though in all the chicken dishes the chicken was not tender,however this one of my fav restaurants in town cz of delicious Sushis,The service was excellent Mr. Mayo was very kind, helpful and courteous."
5,"Had a wonderful Sunday lunch at Global Fusion, Bandra with a group of close friends and our wives ‚Äî and I must say, this place truly lives up to the hype. Located right opposite KFC on Linking Road, it‚Äôs easy to find and perfect for a relaxed group outing.

I‚Äôm not a fan of seafood, so I was pleasantly surprised to find a huge variety of options that suited my taste. We started off with Crispy Corn Pepper Salt, which was crunchy, spicy, and the perfect snack to kick things off. The Ginger Chicken stood out for its bold flavours ‚Äì juicy and well-cooked with just the right amount of zing.

The Vegetable Dimsums and Cottage Cheese in Black Bean Sauce were a hit even among the non-vegetarians in the group. The Honey Chilli Potatoes were another favourite ‚Äì crisp, sweet, and spicy ‚Äì we ended up ordering them twice. For mains, the Chicken Satay with Peanut Sauce was delicious and tender.

They also have assorted veg and chicken sushi, which was surprisingly fresh and tasty. We wrapped up our meal with Chocolate Mousse and refreshing Mango Shots ‚Äì both beautifully presented and a perfect end to a hearty meal.

The buffet spread is generous, the service is warm, and the vibe is perfect for long conversations. If you're going in a group, this place is totally worth it. And if you're like me and skip seafood ‚Äì you‚Äôll still have a great experience."
5,It was an awesome experience....such a cool place in Bandra to enjoy yummiest buffet...Loved the ambience.....the food and also the service..It's my favorite  place to  enjoy a good meal or dinner and spend some good times with friends and family....
5,We have been going to this place from childhood. It is still just the same. The fish and prawns still have the same great taste. It is our family's  go-to place for sea food cravings. They now have so much addition to their menu. Have tried their chicken tikkas as well. It's delicious.
4,"Absolutely delicious!
Punjabi fish fry Basa is a must try also those who love spicy they can go for chicken banjara tikka.
Apart from that we ordered prawns tandoori (tastyy) and mutton seekh (average)
Fish fry are awesome with their iconic green chutney."
4,"Jai Jawan is a popular spot that comes with a lot of hype. We tried the Prawns Koliwada Fry, Basa Fry, and Pomfret Fry, and while they were enjoyable, they didn‚Äôt quite meet our expectations considering the higher price point. That said, it‚Äôs definitely worth trying at least once for the experience, especially if you‚Äôre a seafood enthusiast."
4,"Ordered Amritsari fish fry, paneer tikka & Mutton seekh kebab.
All were average taste, maybe better than that. Seekh kebab was specially chunky n tasty. Fried fish was ice cold"
5,"Jai Jawan is a must-try!

This street food stall is famous for its tikkas and seafood, and it truly lives up to the hype. The restaurant is equally impressive, offering a wide variety of delicious dishes.

We tried the *Prawns Koliwada*, and we were absolutely amazed by both the taste and hygiene. The prawns were fresh, crispy, and bursting with flavor, making every bite a delight. The balance of spices was perfect, leaving us craving more.

For anyone in the area, Jai Jawan is the ideal spot for a quick, satisfying, and flavorful meal. Plus, you can buy fish by the kilo, which is a great option for seafood lovers.

As a Goan, I know the taste of fresh seafood, and this place in Mumbai truly delivers. The Maharashtrian Koliwada flavor is the best, making Jai Jawan a culinary gem you don't want to miss!"
4,"Absolute lovely, delight your taste buds with their food. It has lot of variety of  authentic chinese, korean, thai good diffeent variety of type of noodles and flavours.
Eccellent place to order your food from and quantity is also good.
They lack on customet service which is a big minus on there part it not only needs to improve but require proper basic  training
Even ambience is very nice."
4,"It's an wonderful place for Chinese food
They do not serve 100 authentic Chinese
But have good Chinese dishes
I have met the owner too , he is very sweet
The best Dishes As Per My Experiences are :
Veg manchow soup
Chicken manchow soup
Chicken schezwan Rice
Egg Rice
Chicken in Hunan sauce
The best thing is you can just eat the Rice itself.
It's just so soft you will fall in love with the place the way I have fallen in love.
I have never eaten at this place always home delivery or takeaway"
5,"Things To Try
- spicy crabmeat soup
- fish butter pepper
- authentic lasa, ginger chilli wine and hot basel create the perfect flavor
- grilled chicken in black bean sauce
- authentic manthao bread
- Litchi toffee with ice cream"
4,"The food here is amazing and you won't feel full after eating so much at thier outlet plus they share their kitchen with ""The Noisy Turf"" so you can have sheesha also ;)"
1,This is closed as per 5 spices and near by joints
1,"I had ordered orange gluten free sugar free cake from this bakery. It was a birthday cake for a friend ordered through swiggy app.
So dissapointed with it. Its full of essence immediately got a bad taste in mouth, something was definately off. I called the bakery but no response from them.

We threw it. And this is unlike the bakery which never dissapoints us.
Either they used packaged juice or stale orange juice or some strong essence. This was today morning.
It didn't look bad but taste was terrible."
5,This baker and her bakes have my heart. Been binging on her so very healthy treats for more than 9 years now. It's still tastes like the first bite I had for the first time. Healthy plus delicious a combination very few master and divya has hit jackpot  with her recipes. The dark choc with strawberry/orange/mango all the three signature variations are my most favs.
5,"I ordered the chocolate orange cake for a dinner that I hosted at home. It was totally divine! All of us enjoyed the moist, delicious and healthy cake. Will definitely order it again. I don‚Äôt have a photo to post as we devoured most of the cake!"
5,"Always a great experience with Divya and her team. The cakes are super delicious and they've been consistent through the 8+ years that we've ordered from them.
Whether that's delivering to Delhi, Gujarat, Paris or London - they get it done everywhere, in time and well packaged.
Great job. Onwards and upwards always."
5,"Divya‚Äôs cakes are heavenly and melt in your mouth delicious. The quality, consistency, texture and taste are second to none and I usually run out of adjectives to describe her cakes. I recently had her mango chocolate gluten and sugar free cake and it is now firmly top of my list of favourite cakes I‚Äôve eaten. EVER! Thank you for the wonderful cakes and bakes Divya, here‚Äôs to many many more years of keeping us healthy without missing out on delicious cakes!"
1,"Absolute worse experience I've ever had at a Burger King. The place was unkempt, dirty and disorganised. I had visited the outlet around dinner time ~9:30 pm. Had asked the food to be delivered to my table, it was even mentioned on my bill, however after waiting for quite some time my dad had to go and collect it. The order was ready and just sitting near the order counter. The burgers I received hardly had any toppings in it; just a single slice of onion and a patty. The paneer wrap I had ordered was undercooked and even gave me a nasty stomach bug a few days later. It was not packaged well either. The restroom was pathetic and dirty, reminded me of a railway station restroom. The management or the company, somebody needs to step in and fix a lot of stuff, this place is broken."
2,"The experience here was underwhelming. The floor was noticeably dirty, and tables were left uncleared for over 30 minutes. Although I ordered from the dine-in screen, my food was left on the counter rather than brought to my table. The lack of attention to cleanliness and service was disappointing. Attaching photos to show these issues."
4,"The place is very untidy. The leftovers are not picked up by the staff. Everything is lying on the table. The floor is tooo untidy and dirty.
Burgers are good, even the cheapest burger taste good.
Just the place is unhygienic."
1,"Pathetic hospitality experience.
Serving incomplete orders and getting balance orders after the meal is completed.
Air conditioning just doesn‚Äôt work not once but the 3rd time I visited the outlet.
Just not expect from BK."
5,"This burger king is extremely big, It has good seating capacity, service is fine, taste is as burger king standard"
1,Ordered 2 different curries but both were the same gravy. Chicken lollipops had as minimal meat as possible. Tandoori rotis were hard & difficult to chew. Too expensive for the quality & quantity of food.
5,The Biryani of this place is mind blowing the taste and the softness of the chicken is very good chicken is prepared and marinated so good at it feels so good but the price is little bit I you have to carry some more cash in this restaurant that's it.
5,Food awesome.  Biryani too good. Chapli kebab needs special  mention. We will surely taste it when we will visit Mumbai.
1,Found stapler pin in Biryani and after informing them about it they were like it won't happen next time. #youtakeyourself
5,Nice briyani order online get more discount
4,"We went there with my friends to have dinner.
It's a very nice place, I liked the vibe and the music ü§©.
The cocktails were very good and we liked our meals.
The waiter was really nice but my two friend's meals arrived around 20 Minutes before mine so they already finished their meals when mine arrived.
We had a good time there in spite of this small inconvenience :)."
3,"Located on a busy road in Bandra, the Monkey Bar is easy to locate.

Ambiance: Its spacious with both indoor and outdoor sitting areas. Suitable for small as well as large groups and even as  some quite relaxed for individuals.

We went as a large group so this review is based on that experience.

Food: Freshly made, flavourful and absolutely delicious. We tried some interesting dishes:
‚Ä¢ Barley-pomegranate salad: Subtle crunchy and delicious. Though I couldn't really find all the ingredients they claimed to add in flavour or texture.
‚Ä¢ Raw mango and raw papaya salad: Crunchy, refreshing and one of the best
‚Ä¢Peri peri fries were ok-ok
‚Ä¢ Fish finger with tartar sauce was delicious.
‚Ä¢BBq lamb slider was really good with a beautifully cooked shredded lamb
‚Ä¢Prawn Brucetta and Chicken dimsums were equally delicious.

For the mains:
Malabar egg roast: Beautifully cooked egg roast

Burrito bowl: Everything served in the burrito bowl was delicious.

Desserts: Ok ok. Its ok of you skip it.

While the food was really good, the portion size was definitely questionable especially for the mains. It's understandable that no outlet wants food wastage but the slow food service teamed with even smaller portion sizes was a deal breaker.

Service: The service was definitely slow. The service team definitely looked confused perhaps they had little to no experience with large groups. We had to remind the team about the orders several times. While dishes like salads were available in larger quantities, the other small plates barely hit the tables."
3,"This place is not busy, even on a Friday evening and I reckon it‚Äôs the prices.
I had a small dish of three Malabar eggs with half a paratha  bread . They bury their fries with the famous Perry Perry powder..
When you‚Äôre at the tax and the 10% service charge you finish paying Rs.2292 for a side dish and two beers .
The Persian down the street Joomy Mama does much better food but no booze."
4,"Amazing ü§©..Monkey Bar, Linking Road, Mumbai: A Cozy Hangout

The decor is cozy, thanks to the soft lighting, making it perfect for a night out with friends or a romantic dinner.

Have you been there, or are you planning to visit soon?"
5,"It you‚Äôre looking for a place that you love to feel special, that your place!
Monkey bar is amazing spot for drink and dinner!
Like a person with a lot of requirements for my food and allergies, the chef can help you and create a miracle dish!"
4,"Great food. Scrumptious dumplings, soups, salads. We had the 8 course lunch menu, everything from soup, salad, dimsums, chicken starters, rice, noodles and curry was amazing. We even tried the ramen which was very authentic. The sichuan chilli oil dimsum and the pork Chinese cabbage was to die for."
4,"Linking Road in Bandra is home to some of the best food in the city, and one of the best asian joints in the place is The fatty Bao. It has a modern, chic vibe crossed with a vibrant and sassy decor, perfect for a date night, or for a hangout sesh with friends.

The decor feels inspired by Malay/Singaporean cafes, with a lot of the artwork depicting the same, and it comes off pretty well. They have both indoor and outdoor seating, though the indoor seating is a bit cramped, but that's mostly fine. They do have a small bar serving the usual suspects, as well as some of their own stuff.

While I didn't get to order a large chunk of their menu, whatever I had was pretty great. Their name is definitely apt, as the baos I got were plump and pillowy, and the filling was perfect. I got the pork char siu baos, and the pork was fatty and melt in your mouth, complimented nicely by a slice of raw apple, giving it a fruity kick. Every Bao order comes with two, making it perfect for date night.

I also got their raw papaya salad, which was one of the best renditions of the dish I've eaten in Mumbai. It was tangy, sweet and spicy in just the right amounts, and wasn't just a refreshing palate cleanser, but a great meal by itself. It's also a very generous portion making it great for sharing.

The last thing I got were Chicken and asparagus dumplings, which didn't impress me as much, as I've had better dumplings in the same price range. They weren't bad but not particularly great either. The filling was generous, but it lacked in flavor. For 6 pieces, it was not the best value, and I recommend trying other dumplings, or avoiding dumplings all together.

Overall, I would rate both the Char Siu Bao and the Papaya Salad a solid 9/10, and the dumplings about a 6.5/10. Definitely go for their baos( pretty obvious given their name).

The service was fine, but they do tend to ignore the smaller tables and focus on the bigger groups, and it was also pretty busy on the day I visited. But I did see other tables also not receiving food at the proper times, so I'd rate the service a little lower, like a 6/10. Definitely could do with some improvement.

The Fatty Bao definitely ticks a lot of the boxes, though they do miss a little bit in their service, and cocktail variety, though I did not have the opportunity to try it. However, they more than make up for it with their snazzy decor and contemporary vibe, along with some pretty great food. I highly recommend checking the place out if you're out shopping in Linking Road and need to grab some lunch or dinner. You're definitely gonna be leaving a happy and fatty bao when you're done.

Final rating- 8.5/10, definitely recommend."
4,"The tempura sushi, mushroom dumplings, cottage cheese bao and avocado cheese sushi all tasted amazing. Cocktails could have been better since they were expensive. The mushroom and chicken Ramen weren't very authentic since I have had better ones. Overall it was good, would go again and order more of their appetizers."
5,"The menu at Fatty Bao is a true culinary masterpiece. With a wide range of delectable dishes inspired by Asian fusion cuisine, there is something to satisfy every palate. Whether you're a fan of sushi, dim sum, or flavorful stir-fries, Fatty Bao has it all. Each dish is expertly crafted with fresh ingredients and bursting with flavors that leave you craving for more.
The staff members were attentive, knowledgeable about the menu offerings, and went above and beyond to ensure our dining experience was nothing short of exceptional. They were happy to accommodate any dietary restrictions or preferences we had, making us feel valued as customers.Fatty Bao is an absolute must-visit. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!"
4,"I am not very big on Asian food but i decided to try it anyway and a friend recommended this place so, here we go. The ambience is very pleasant. very hospitable staff.
Started with drinks and a few appetizers.

The drinks were great and so were the appetizers.

Tried the char siu bao, the meat was seriously overcooked and very dry. A little disappointed because of that.

Also, when taking the last round of order, nobody asked around whether we wanted to order more. They need to work more of customers.

Overall this place is amazing but they could've done better in terms of food and customer satisfaction.

Cheers!"
4,It's a good place to have drinks and food. They have a place to sit outside as well as inside with AC sitting. The best part is that they give 3 complimentary snacks with drink options. You can check the images for complimentary snacks they offer. They have decent pricing for food and drinks. We tried their Paneer crispy which was delicious.
3,"Nothing special about this one. There is a small outdoor seating where you can smoke and an even smaller indoor seating. Value for money is low. Even a basic dish like veg crispy was tasteless.  They give complimentary peanuts and taste fried loops with each round of drinks. The waiter was good and the ambience is ... blue. Just come here if you want a quick drink, don't go for the food."
5,"The best for drinks n dine, the bar where u can order from nearby restaurants also & people come there r so friendly, staff is so helpful. They adjust ur need of drinks n smoke. Best place fir chilling."
3,Good joint to for a casual chat with friends.. loved the chicken lollipop which was made in tandoor and not deep fried. It was yummy.
4,Chicken Tandoori and lollypops are very good.
5,"Lovely time at Artisan cafe! No rush, really good place to chill at and hangout in BKC. Very helpful and attentive staff.

The coffee was really good, quite uncommon for hotel cafes."
4,Absolutely love the ambiance and how they present their coffee each time. Not a fan of the service and how you need to flag down their attention or they don‚Äôt notice you even if they‚Äôre sitting idle and rather just chat among themselves.
5,"Great experience. We came for dinner. Food was delicious and entire staff was super polite. Our chef Tanishq was amazing. He came to our table to make sure we are having a wonderful time and everything was up to our liking. He went above and beyond to prepare everything as per our taste.
Great service and great food. Must try"
5,"Artisan Lounge & Bar offers a unique and inviting atmosphere perfect for unwinding. The interior combines modern elegance with cozy charm, creating a warm ambiance. Their cocktail menu is creatively crafted, with a range of innovative drinks that cater to diverse tastes. The bartenders are knowledgeable and skilled, ensuring that each drink is perfectly made. The food menu, featuring tapas and light bites, complements the drinks well, with lavorful options for any palate. Service is attentive and friendly, adding to the overall welcoming vibe. It's a great spot for a casual night out or a more intimate gathering. The playlist sets the perfect mood without overpowering conversation Whether you're there for a quick drink or a night of socializing, the experience is always top-notch Highly recommended for anyone looking for a relaxed yet sophisticated night out."
5,"Had gone to have a quick coffee and chat with a friend ended up having a repeat order and chat with Gaurav about all the speciality coffee they offer , awesome attentive service  by Gaurav , Nikshit and the Barista Sunil .."
4,The food was top class. Very less use of artificial colors and typical Chinese sauces. The taste was quite good. Go for chicken schezwan noodles. Only problem I had was that they were bit partial towards combo eaters. Combo was served in no time while it took ages to make my noodles. But still was worth it
3,"Located in the food court of Phoenix Market city Kurla , I‚Äôve visited them twice for Chinese ...
Their chilli chicken is delicious
Chilli garlic noodles are too yummy

However the chicken momos - steamed were not upto the mark... the coating was too thick
Chicken lollipop as well, the batter was just too thick and the preparation lacked salt n spice... though one good thing is that there was less food colour used...
Chicken hot garlic gravy can be given a miss...

Quantity is decent
Quality in few dishes was good, few improvement is needed..."
5,"Great, tastt and flavoursome food. Excellent momos and sizzler. The owner is very hospitable and helpful but in his absence the staff denies certain dishes. The sizzlers and momos are highly recommended."
5,Went there in a rush and had the very very yummy garlic rice .....
3,"Average Chinese, almost similar to roadside Chinese taste actually. Just that it is comparatively more hygienic. Portions are Ok, but pricing is inconsistent, given its in phoenix mall ofcourse. The Manchurian rice combo was served hot and the gravy had some veggies tossed in..chicken cooked was soft and thankfully not that chewy. Overall food experience Ok, maybe a slight above average on extremely hungry days."
5,I tried chocobite ice cream over there taste was awesome and staff were very professional specially kishan..... I enjoyed....
5,"I tried mango pieces with malai icecream.
If someone reading my review pls try it you won't regret cause it's value for money......."
2,"In the crowded food court of market city, scoop size is comparatively small compared to the other outlets."
4,"Naturals Ice cream have always been true to it's quality.
We ordered Blueberry icecream, Roasted Almond icecream and tender coconut icecream. Total costed ‚Çπ 215/-.

Tender coconut have always been my favourite so it's a MUST HAVE. Roasted almond was also good in taste.

Earlier 1 scoop was around 40 and now it's 70 may be because it lies in a mall."
4,"The Mango Ice Cream at Naturals is pure bliss fresh, creamy, and bursting with real mango flavor"
5,"It's Good to Have a Meal Over here.
The Food was 4/5.
As their services is quite faster and they maintain a good hygeine.
I specially Recommend All to grab A Tea , it's worth of penny."
1,"They serve ""green"" colored Diwani Handi ! üòÜüòÜ and proudly say ""yaha to green hi banti hai"""
5,"Visited for the second time and the service plus food was still great.

We went for dinner and tried out multiple dishes like Pav Bhaji, Veg Cutlet and Sev Puri instead of a regular meal. It was all delicious and worth the price. Pav were a little too buttery but good for once in a while experience.

Sitting arrangement is simple but well maintained. I loved the fact that it is pure vegetarian. Will come again some day.

Check out my blog on Instagram @gourmet_central for more food stuff."
2,"Ordered pau bhaji taste was not tht good like before, rice was good, packaging rice in foil container spoiled whole mood, called them for feedback tht u shld pack in plastic container and charge extra but the guy was nt ready to listen. Its my old memory restaurant thts y i order and gave feedback..hope owner will look onto this."
5,"I have been going to this restaurant since i was a kid and I have nothing but compliments to give everytime. The food is really delicious. The inside of the restaurant is pretty clean too. The staff over there are good too. The price of the food is pretty reasonable. It offers takeout as well as home delivery. If looking for a good restaurant in that area, you should really go there, I'm sure you won't be disappointed.üíú"
5,
5,"service is too slow,
but very tasty...TASTY and HALAAL very rare,

5,Best pizza and Burger best quality food in kurla west pls try it
5,A perfect place for pizza and burger the taste are so awesome that one cannot forget
5,Awesome taste.low price high quantity.one should visit once to experience the taste.
5,Good place for pizzas and burgers
5,"Almost 25 Years old Restaurant located in the Old Gully of Kurla! Right in front of Habib Hospital Hallow Pool

Must Visit for a perfect Dinner with Family
Food and Rates are totally Good one can afford and enjoy

Do try their Dharavi Dry Sizzler and Mexican Kabsa rice

Must Visit whenever in Kurla ü§åüèªüòã"
5,"The ambience (5/5) is really good here. The service was good and prompt, may be because I visited this place on a weekday. I had
* Chicken cheesy kebabs - the chicken supreme pieces (6 big pieces) were tender and juicy (5/5)
* Masala Papad - this was regular quarter plate size papad with not so overloaded toppings which was actually good because heavy toppings makes it difficult to eat and makes the papad soggy. (4/5)
* Virgin Mojito - again, a regular glass of Virgin Mojito, not too artificially sweet. (4/5)
* Kunafa - this was served in a small bowl, the vermicelli was not crisp (which I expected it to be) however the inside was filled with good amount of soft cream cheese. It was topped with just perfect amount of saffron sugar syrup (not too sweet) and some diced badam and kaju (dry fruits were not really chopped fine)"
4,"The vibe here is good, it is newly opened. The food was also good but a bit oily and price is at a higher side. Any starter would be around 490 per dish. The tasty was good. We ordered
Mutton seekh - 3.5/5
Chicken satay -4/5
Murgh Kohinoor - 4/5
Zaffrani chicken tikka - 5/5
Chicken patialaya -4.5/5
Afgani chicken masala - 4/5
And some rice, naan and mojito the bill was around 4K"
5,"You are such a looser if you have'nt eaten their Sitaphal cream (Rs 120) and Arabic pudding (Rs 80). 5 stars for them, other food items I havent tried yet here."
5,"The most affordable restaurant without compromising on quality in Kurla. A dinner for 2 with 2 starters, 1 gravy, tandoori roti & zeera rice wont go beyond 1k.
Must try Singapori Khapsa Rice on Wednesday."

5,"Shalimar is a gem of a restaurant that blends a royal vibe with exceptional food. As someone who has cherished this place since childhood, I can confidently say it‚Äôs a must-visit for food enthusiasts. The ambience is warm, welcoming, and perfect for family dinners or hangouts with friends.

Their Mughlai and Chinese cuisines are the stars of the show. Every dish, from the kebabs to the biryanis, bursts with authentic flavors. The seating arrangement is another highlight, offering private sections for families and groups, ensuring a comfortable and intimate dining experience.

Service here is top-notch, with staff always attentive and polite. The attention to detail, both in the food and the overall atmosphere, makes Shalimar a standout spot. Whether it‚Äôs your first time or the hundredth, this place never fails to impress. Trust me, Shalimar will leave you coming back for more!"
2,"I had been to a client visit and then decided to have lunch with the client at Shalimar, but the food was too oily and spicy, and the service was also too slow and not at all professional with the order arriving after an hour and a half. I liked the atmosphere, but the quality and service were pathetic."
4,"We visited Shalimar on a Sat night at around 930pm. They have valet. Got a table immediately. The restaurant was almost full.

Decor is lovely, new and shiny. Prices are higher than what I remember in the Sobo original Shalimar.

What we ate -
1. Tawa bheja - 5/5 great

2. Nalli Nihari - 3/5 it is supposed to be the shank piece of the goat, but we just got regular mutton. Also,
a bit bland.

3. Shami kebabs were unavailable, really wanted to try them

4. Fresh lime soda - I specifically asked for sweet, but got sweet and salted.

They don‚Äôt serve any international colas. Extensive range of mocktails are available. Book a table on the online apps in advance to get a better discount.

We paid about 1250 rs for 2 for the above meal."
5,üòãMust try prawns 380 dry and chicken irani tandoori.. Good place to go with family and friends.. service and atmosphere is quite decentüëçüèª
5,Quality of food is great
5,"Their chicken pakkora is awesome, whenever I visit in Mumbai I come here to eat chicken pakkora. It's second time. Comming here....will visit again."
4,"I recently visited Deluxe and I must say, the experience was exceptional. The food was undoubtedly good, with a distinct Mughlai touch that left my taste buds wanting more. But what really impressed me was the ambiance of the place. The decor was quite beautiful and the overall feel of the restaurant was warm and inviting.

The staff were also a delight to interact with. Theey treated all the customers with respect and made sure that everyone was comfortable. .
In summary, I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a great dining experience with an average budget. The combination of good food and an amazing ambiance, coupled with the staffs' excellent code of conduct, make for an unforgettable experience."
3,"The food was tasty ü§§ their Naan was so buttery and soft ! I ordered the paneer butter masala and it was delicious. Biryani was okay. And the tandoori chicken wasn‚Äôt that juicy. Lastly I had desserts and Arabi pudding was to die for with ice cream. The caramel pudding was not that great.
The place was a small dine restaurant for family and one good thing is they don‚Äôt allow anyone except family in this restaurant and for others they have another restaurant of theirs right next to this. üëçüèª"
4,"""Wow, just wow! Our dining experience here was truly exceptional. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, with impeccable attention to detail that made us feel like we were in for a real treat. And the food? Absolutely phenomenal. Every bite was a masterclass in flavor and technique, with each dish expertly crafted to showcase the freshest, highest-quality ingredients. The service was top-notch too - friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive without being intrusive. We can't wait to come back and do it all again. Five stars, ten stars, a million stars - we'd give it all the stars in the world if we could!"""
4,"one of the best pocket friendly hotel in kurla  to njoyyy and hangout with friends, best dishes to try here are chicken pakoda, chicken Dabba gosht, mutton Dabba gosht, chicken Malai tikka

The very new family section is just amazing
Handsdown for the beautiful creation, great ambiance and service too.

Now you can make online payments too, as they started with card payments and Google pay too"
4,"I have been seeing this place for a decade now either through passing by or simply when we go shopping around near Kurla (West) station. This place is always buzzing no matter what day it is. Being a crunch place, one might have to wait for 5 minutes or so but not more than that. Being a fast food space for tasty street food, Shree Guru Nanak serves amazing and delicious Pani Puri, Dahi Wadas, and our all time pick Ragda Pattice. The water they serve with the puri's is damn delicious. The staff is also warm and always welcoming. Being close to the station, this becomes an ideal place to try tasty street food at an affordable price."
2,"This place serves good Ragda & Dahi Pattice. Other food options include Paani Puri, Misal Pav and a few other snacks. They have also expanded their menu recently with Chinese and North Indian dishes. It is just outside Kurla station (west side) on a busy street, so travelling here with your vehicle is not recommended. The only concern here would be the place hygiene, as it doesn't appear well maintained. Two stars only for the food, people with OCD or a hygiene first requirements should avoid."
4,"Aloo Tikki with Chole and Chutney..perfect snack for evening cravings..
The tikkis were perfectly cooked with burst of flavours and the plus point in this dish is the chole that they serve along with the tikkis as the chole was
mind blowing with perfect belnd of spiciness and tanginess..overall the food is great but te ambience is not nice..its an old place serving delicacies like pani puri, misal pav, chaat items, aloo tikis and faloodas since many years so the ambience is also very old and not that great..you can try it for food"
5,"A best place to have snacks.

Must have a patice (in real ghee) and cold Pani Puri...

Hummmmm yammi"
1,"Dissapointed almost after 10 years,  major hygiene issues now a days few days back i found hair in pattice and now even in pani puri... Felt like puking. I never wanted this to happen because it was the only place I used to eat chat.i was a huge fan of this place and have suggested every person in my life to taste it but now feeling sad... Kindly do the need"
2,Poor service from a person working here. He was forcefully charging 20rs extra to add  cheese even when asked not to. He directly refused to serve if we didn't pay extra for adding cheese.. ridiculously scammy behavior.
3,It is one of the best fries I have had in a while. The staff is very friendly and the ambience is serene. The rates are affordable. One can quickly munch over the snacks without burning a hole into the pocket.
4,"I had nachoos burger, it was quite tasty. There are offers according to week days in short everyday there is a offer."
2,Wrong burger given without cheese when I paid for it.
3,Jumboking is a huge and international brand but still they give franchisee to a bad vendor who don't actually grow their brand but thay just trying to get money from customer and although space here is located in a good facing but in case of rain or wndy weather you either go inside or grab a takeaways and eat at your place . sometimes this place is crowdy although Facilities here is good but not so taste in their fast-food self service don't matter still they act like they are doing favour over you.
1,"I am really very disappointed with the cake and the service. They have given me a spoilt cake . The cake was so stale it tasted very bad in the mouth even another customer would feel so but they did not accept instead they asked us to write a complaint letter which is of no use claiming they would not refund any amount 430 rupees for a stale cake sponge was all crumbled . (Which cake shop asks to keep the cake out for 30 min? Uderstandable if it was fresh ganache cake!)  very disappointed waste of money, birthday spoilt!  worst service !"
1,"Today, I have bought Chocolate delight cake from Monginis. The sponge is all crumbled, cake is stale, dry, hard with a lack of moisture, and potentially an unpleasant taste due to the dried-out ingredients, indicating that the cake has been sitting out for too long and is no longer fresh, essentially, a poor quality eating experience due to its staleness. We have gone to the shop for an exchange of cake but they denied for any exchange or refund. The cake cost- rs 430. Money wasted. We have wrote the letter for the cake testing. Staff is not at all helpful. Rude behaviour. Worst experience ever"
5,Best cake shop of kurla. Very genuine and helpful staff helps you to choose cakes according to your needs and also cakes are always fresh available here. Overall good service
1,"My order no. MONGINIS-011635 has not been delivered, yet the portal incorrectly shows it as delivered. This is highly disappointing, and the lack of communication or updates about the delivery is unacceptable. I expect immediate action to resolve this issue and ensure proper service in the future."
1,They have really spoiled there brand value I have brought chicken burger the price printer was 50 they are charging 55 saying printing issue and the burger and pizza are not fresh now they sell in packed packet not the same taste has childhood
1,I would never do a review even if the food is bad‚Ä¶.but this ice cream is the worst thing I have ever tasted in my life I order their strawberry sorbet and Belgium chocolate I ordered that about 2-3 weeks back I tasted 1 spoon from each container and believe me or not that pathetic disgusting ice cream is still lying in my freezer I wasted my money and also lost my taste buds
3,"This cake shop is best for pastries , I specifically loved the ras malai pastry & the zebra torte & the Ferrero Rocher cake was tasty as well, but pastries are slightly expensive, quality is better but quantity is slightly less than we expect , but overall good cake shop, staff is helpful"
2,"Overrated with high prices.
They have degraded their quality and taste.
There are other better options in the market for same  price."
5,"Coming to this shop more then 14 yrs now,
The owner still greets me with same smile on face and always suggest the best cake for my family celebration.
Monginis taste has been always great one
But the customer service I receive from the shop owner has been best out of so many shop I visit."
5,"The monginis store at Kurla east is excellent. The owner is customer friendly and greets everyone with warmth.The staff here is also good.The owner here takes extra efforts to fulfill the needs of the customers. Even the delivery  is provided  very quickly  and whenever asked for.The shop calls if the cake is not picked.The place is hygienic. The shop offers all varieties  of cake and also other party items.The savouries served are all fresh .Customized cakes are also provided if asked on an urgent basis.The owner had send the staff to the factory  to get my cake on urgent requirement. Monginis  is really providing  a delightful experience to its customers. I am happy with the tasty and freshness of the cake.Most importantly, it is customer  friendly. I even loved the concept that monginis is providing first hand experience of visiting the factory to the young generation."
1,Worst service of employee don‚Äôt have manners to talk
4,"Recently visited Arabian Luqma. For starters, we ordered  Chicken Batlava and Chicken Moroccan. they were so tender, flavorful & well spiced.
Next, tried their Mutton Omani Mandi and Mutton Yemeni Roasted Mandi, requesting it to be mildly spicy. While the spice level was still on the lower side but damn good in taste. It  was served with soup and the portion size was more than enough. It was a great switch from the usual restaurants. Overall the visit was satisfying and worth it.
Improvement area - Instead of rice they should add more pieces of chicken/Mutton (üòî should be 3 or 4 in single rather than 2 )"
4,Food is good . Request to the owner or manager you have lots of waste food. Please give it to hungry animals outside your Hotel. Instead of throwing into the dustbin Thanks
5,"I have been to this place couple of times and the food is just amazing... Place is little small
Last time we ordered mutton Turkish Mandi which was well cooked... mutton pieces were well tendor and and juicy... their mutton soup was just amazing creamy and grapes juice with grapes pulp in it. Overall a very good experience.. they have got sitting and dastarkhawan sitting which is good 10-12 people"
5,"Very nice restaurant. The Arabic food or you can say the Arabian food is very tasty and delicious here everyone must try this Arabian luqma restaurant.

The staff and food were very good.
We had tried here the quarter mandi as well as the starters which was very tasty."
3,Had to wait for an hour. We've taken omani mandi and it tasted good. Turkish mandi is delicious. But the turkish soup is just average.
2,"Tasteless & Unhygienic.......
@Kessas has completely sacrificed quality for price competition.
The food tasted artificial, and the noodles seemed questionable. Very disappointing!"
3,"This was my go-to spot for a while, however in recent times, the overall experience has been quite average. The discontinuation of the Buy-2-Get-1-Free offer was very disappointing.

Coming to the menu options, the Crunchy Chicken Shawarma remains a standout. The Fish Shawarma is another winner on the menu. The momos and salad also have a decent taste.

The option of Rumali Roti provides a slightly healthier choice, albeit at a slightly higher price."
5,"Kesas has been on my list for a long time and I must say the place has won my heart totally. I have heard a lot about their Shawarma's and Lollipop and they have been by far the best place where I have come across such quality chicken lollipop and shawarma.
1- Arabic Shawarma - Thinly diced soft and tender chicken well marinated and cooked in a thick spicy masala having the typical spice element hitting correctly with balanced sharp flavors from the  pickled beetroot with creamy cheese and curd sauce to make the spice of the shawarma a balanced one. Totally loved the texture and the softness of the chicken with the coasted spice making the shawarma a one of a kind one.
2- Peri Peri Chicken Lollipop- One of the best chicken lollipop i have ever had. With crunchy crispy layer outside and soft and juicy chicken on the inside with the goodness of the peri peri seasoning well coated and marinated with the flavors reaching right to all the parts of the chicken. Wholesome with the right amount of spice kicking in , in every bite.
3- Chilli chicken-  I am sure chilli chicken is everyone's favorite and kesas has a different touch to their chilli chicken. Well glazed chicken in soy sauce , with stir fried bell peppers along with the hit of pepper with long chicken pieces making it a juicy and tender ride to enjoy.
4- Veg Momos -  Soft juicy veggies steamed well served along with scallion oil and schezwan sauce having a soft tender and sweet filling in the inside.
Totally loved the service here , the staff is really quick with their service and they have an amazing staff concerned with the customer satisfaction more. Love the place."
5,If anything I will miss about tilak nagar it will be kesas. One of the best shawarma places in Mumbai with other wide variety of food choices to pick from too. If u ever happen to be nearby do try the crunchy chicken or crunchy prawns shawarma
4,"A small humble outlet with outdoor seating which provides some lip smacking food and their speciality is the Arabian cuisine. Food quantity is more than decent here and the packaging was nice as well. We especially love their Shawarma's..üòã We ordered the following to eat :
Veg Moroccan Salad - Roasted veggies tossed with herbs, spices, lemon juice and cheese. This was average in terms of taste.
Chicken Biryani (Half) - We couldn't believe our eyes when we saw the quantity of food for a half plate of Biryani..üòÆ Tender pieces of nicely marinated and roasted chicken with aromatic Basmati rice, the flavour was on point. Would highly recommend this..ü§§"
5,"I really like this cafe this cafe vibe is so chilled that you will definitely visit this cafe me and my friends really enjoyed spending time in this cafe and it is best spot for your family and friends to spend time in this cafe  and their menu are so affordable and their dishes are so tasty and I will definitely tell you to try their chilly cheese toast sandwich which Is loaded with full of veggies and is so cheesey and you should not skip their drink that where so refreshing . WE Have tried their

Food Items -

Cheese chilly toast

Paneer masala maggi

Peri peri fries

Drinks -

Strawberry Iced tea

Caramel Cold coffee

And you should definitely visit this cafe"
5,"Great food.. quick service..
Best things to try.. peri peri fries.. masala veg maggi.. chocolate sandwich.. caramel hot chocolate"
4,"Located just outside the main ground of Chembur West, this is a small eatery/cafe which serves amazing cold and hot beverages. We visit here often and I'd definitely recommend their cold hazelnut coffee. If you're more into tea, you can try their ginger and cardamom tea as well. The staff is very kind and generous."
5,"Growing up in a small town, caf√©s weren‚Äôt really a part of my everyday life. I used to see them in movies and shows‚Äîpeople enjoying coffee, reading books, having deep conversations, or just soaking in the cozy atmosphere. It all looked fascinating, but for me, it was something distant, something I hadn‚Äôt experienced firsthand.

During my school days, going to a caf√© wasn‚Äôt an option. It wasn‚Äôt about affordability alone; it just wasn‚Äôt a part of the culture around me. But the idea of sitting in a beautifully lit caf√©, sipping on a warm cup of coffee or chai, always felt like something I would love.

Once I started earning, I decided to explore and experience what I had only seen on screens. That‚Äôs when I discovered ‚ÄúSteamy Mugs‚Äù(Prem Vellaiyan) in Mumbai‚Äîa place that instantly became one of my favorites. The warm ambiance, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, and the simple joy of enjoying chai or coffee with bun maska‚Äîit was everything I had imagined and more.

It may seem like a small thing, but for me, it was a moment of realizatdion. The little joys we once only dreamt of can become a reality with time. Sometimes, progress isn‚Äôt just about big achievements‚Äîit‚Äôs also about experiencing things you once wished for.

If you‚Äôre someone who enjoys a cozy caf√© experience with great food and a comforting cup of tea or coffee, Steamy Mugs is definitely worth a visit."
2,"Bad food quality. Especially poor service.
So much compromise on food for someone who cares to be passionate about food.
Checkout the misplaced order that the waiter took for corn cheese chilly toast. And then simply adds corn on top of existing sandwich to make it corn chilly cheese toast. Cocky and meritless service."
3,"Visited BKC Dive recently and honestly, it was just about okay. The place has a casual vibe, good for chilling with friends, but nothing really stood out. Music was loud, which is fine if you‚Äôre in the mood to party, but not ideal if you‚Äôre looking to have a conversation.

Went to watch an IPL match with friends, but The screen size from the seating area was too small, so the match wasn‚Äôt clearly visible unless you were really close. It didn‚Äôt give that energetic match-watching vibe you‚Äôd expect at a sports bar.

The food was average ‚Äì not bad, but not something I‚Äôd go back specifically for. Drinks menu is decent, and they have happy hours which is a plus. Service was a bit slow, and the staff seemed distracted at times.

Overall, it‚Äôs an okay spot for a casual evening if you‚Äôre in the area, but don‚Äôt expect anything too great."
4,"I visited BKC Dive and tried their crispy French fries, fish fingers, mandarin mojito, crispy corn, and paneer Szechwan fingers sizzler. The food was okay‚Äîthe fries were crunchy, fish fingers were decent, and the mojito had a nice citrusy taste. The crispy corn was fun, and the sizzler was spicy with a cool sizzle, but nothing stood out too much. Service was a little slow, though the staff was friendly. Parking costs ‚Çπ100, which is fine. The place has a lively vibe, and I might visit again to try other dishes."
3,"I went for a Monday lunch so the place was not at all crowded.
The food was average, only deserts were above average.
The restaurant has no parking space so I had to park the car on the road outside you may get a feeling it's not that safe based on the surroundings, so avoid taking vehicles to this place.
I was informed by the building guard that valet parking was available only during evenings that too, not in the building premises.
Their seats are not that comfortable so you may feel like leaving the place after an hour. Their 2 seater tables are small so avoid them.
I paid around 820 for 2 for a lunch buffet so one cannot expect too much at this price point.

For me it's a 1 time visit place. I would say it's a good space for college students who have a limited budget and no vehicles for lunch buffets."
2,"The food is absolutely pathetic. I mean instead of pita we were served some kind of Naan with the hummus. The Chinese food, all 3 dishes tasted really bad. The Bellini was really nice though, they have some one on one offers for drinks. But, the service was great. We didn't bother ordering any dessert."
5,Nice place to enjoy with friends at BKC. Ample of space with different types of chairs available. Weekend special discounts available on selected beverages and food. Check the offers available before ordering to get the best deal. Not recommended for kids best for friends parties and enjoying. Food is good and the ambiance provides you a good feel. Happy and enjoyed the BKC dive
5,"Best time to go 5-8pm. for Happy hour 1 get 1 üçª all in beverage menu get the deal...

Recommend food is
- French fries üçü
- Onion ring
- All meat pizza
- Grill fish
- Fish and chips
- Lamb burger 3 pieces

We enjoy good vibes and great service from staff. Highly recommend üëç"
4,"It was my birthday and after playing at game pallacio we were hungry and we went to 'The Irish house'. The ambience was amazing, we sat near bar, we ordered virgin mojito, carribean party pizza( which was so good) and Irish fried chicken ( which was fine but the fries and dip given with it was so good).
Since it was my birthday we asked for chocolate torte which they served in beautifully decorated plate with lil candle as we asked for. Overall it was amazing experience here."
4,"I have been to Irish house in Belagavi and we went here to third our crunch from full day of shopping.
I love the food in Irish house. It's very good."
5,"Absolutely love The Irish House in Kurla! The vibe is upbeat and welcoming ‚Äî perfect for both weekend hangouts and casual evenings. The interiors have that classic pub charm with modern touches, and the music adds to the energetic ambiance.

Food is consistently amazing ‚Äî highly recommend the Mac n Cheese Bombs, Chicken Wings, Their drinks menu is fantastic too ‚Äî great selection of beers and creative cocktails. The Electric LIIT and Jameson-based cocktails are a must-try!

Service is prompt and staff is super friendly. One of the best spots in Kurla for good food, great drinks, and even better vibes. Definitely coming back!"
4,"Always a great time at Irish House!
I‚Äôve always loved Irish House, it never disappoints, and the Kurla outlet was no different. This was my first time visiting this location, and it was a good experience overall. We went only for drinks, and everything from the service to the vibe was spot on. The ambience is lively, the music is good, and it‚Äôs just a solid place to unwind. Definitely worth a visit if you‚Äôre around!"
4,"We were 7 people and went to BBQ Nation to celebrate our colleague‚Äôs birthday. The food was really tasty, especially the starters ‚Äì we loved the grilled pineapple and crispy corn! The staff was polite and even surprised us with a small cake for the birthday.

The main course was good, and there were many options in desserts too. We had a great time overall. Just felt the place was a little crowded, but still a lovely experience!"
4,"If you are craving for food, bbq nation is the place you have to visit. Bbq nation Phoenix mall kurla is recommended. The mall is a great place to hang out too. Family or friends, it is the most suitable place to dine. Reasonable price 1.2k approx per person,  you get unlimited food, unlimited desserts üç® ü•ß. Worth the visit,  visiting again soon."
5,Barbecue nation is a great restaurant with a wide variety of food their staff was pretty kind and quick. Food is really great main course had a lot of options they have a perfect grill and deserts are perfect this is one of my favourite restaurant
1,"On 26th April 2025, we visited Barbeque Nation, Kurla, located inside Phoenix Mall. Unfortunately, our experience was below average. Despite paying ‚Çπ1249 per person, both the food and the overall experience were not up to the mark.

I have experienced multiple buffet restaurant chains, but this visit was one of the worst.
Very basic and not recommended at all.

1. The food taste was not good at all. The chicken leg pieces, prawns, and noodles were not cooked properly.

2. No live counters were active during our visit. The same part-time staff member was serving guests at tables and then rushing to the live counter to serve pani puri and kulfi.

3. There was a long wait time for repeat orders. We were a group of nine people, yet we had to call the waiter loudly from different tables to request service. Despite the outlet having only 30% occupancy, a single waiter was managing multiple tables.

4. The ambience was not attractive. The soup container was dirty and full of spilled soup, and the worst part was that the AC was not even switched on. Also multiple little Cockroaches on dinning table

5. There were very few main course options available.

Our entire team is very disappointed with the food quality and the overall experience we received."
4,"Visited Barbeque Nation with my mom yesterday.
It was really very nice experience with them.
They have did very nice service.
I loved their barbecue style which was on table.
Chicken kebab, fish kebab, Chicken seekh kebab, paneer tikka Was on grill.
On buffet i tried,
Chicken Masala and hakka noodles. Taste of the food was really very delicious.
Overall experience was excellent"
1,Unfortunately the food quality does not live upto the charges. Overall we had a very average experience at such a popular restaurant in BKC. Limited options.
5,"Masala Library is located in BKC and it is easy to find.

The restaurant comes from Massive Restaurants by Jiggs Kalra hence you should he prepared that the dining experience here will not be a traditional one. They have prepared a multi course tasting meal which has appetisers, mains and desserts and don‚Äôt think about the quantity as it looks less but at the end of the meal your stomach will be full and you will be definitely satisfied.

The restaurant is spacious with fine dine decor and seats are arranged systematically. Loved the minimal approach and the dim lights adds nice touch to the overall ambiance.

Went here for a weekday dinner and the kitchen service was on time and table service by staff Sanket & Nilesh was excellent as they knew the menu well and they were attentive and proactive.

This time I won‚Äôt be explaining each and every dish as the list of items we tried was big and I have mentioned the entire menu below.
In brief I can say that it was indeed a memorable dining experience as the dishes made here are unique taste wise and the use of ingredient wise. They have created something that they can only make and you will not get such dishes anywhere. It is pricey but you can go here to celebrate something special as it will make you happy.

So our meal at Masala Library BKC was one of a kind experience which I would recommend everyone to try once."
4,"I went a few years ago, so the menu will have changed. Masala library really set the scene for new modern cooking in Mumbai and they explored techniques that hadn't been seen in the city. The food in my opinion was good but not incredible, it felt heavy and sat in the stomach but that could have been what we ordered. I would like to go back to try it again"
4,Went for 9 course meal.. appetizer and dessert were good. However not impressed with main course.. nothing special.. too much of Garam Masala in main course..
5,"Have been hearing about this place since maybe 2-3 years. Finally went there yesterday on my anniversary. Tried the tasting menu.  It was a 9 course meal. Check the photo the menu and items. Every dish was unique and amazing to taste. Though expensive it‚Äôs worth a visit for a special occasion.

Good food , nice service , great vibes."
1,"If you just wanna know why just one star in short, they apparently don't get their pest control done and we saw a cockroach in the restaurant roaming around here and there on the wall.

We ordered:-

Rasam Wada
Steam Idli
Cheese Tomato Paneer Uttapam
Dahi Bhalla Chaat
FIlter Coffee

Food was good and tasty. Service is good and ambience is nice as well. But the whole mood got spoiled when we saw a cockroach roaming around and no efforts taken by the staff to do anything about it. Also uploading the unclear pic of the cockroach which I managed to capture."
5,Authentic South Indian food available here. It's very clean restaurant. Had plain dosa it's was fresh and crisp. Good place for southindian food lovers a pure veg restaurant.
3,"Nice air conditioned place with enough seating. The food is served quickly and is delicious. They‚Äôre known for their South Indian food. The idli, dosa and pavbhaji are yummy. They even serve all food in Jain on request."
4,Very nice option for pure vegetarian food. I loved their cheese pav bhaaji. The ambience is great. Hospitality is good.
4,Nice food only the spoon and fork were a bit dirty .. but lovely place it was very quite inside and really felt nice ..
4,"This outlet is of Phoenix Marketcity mall kurla branch. The space is fine not too big nor too congested. The vibe of it is pretty decent and not too fancy which is a good point. Sitting arrangement are good and comfortable. Service was very good. Food was also upto the mark just could be better heated. Many items were not able such as pizzas, shakes etc due to machine problems.
Food tried :
* sizzling schezwan vegetable pan fried noddles 4/5.
* steamed saucy wonton. 4/5.
* strawberry tall ice cream soda 5/5
highly recommended. ‚ô•
*green apple & curry leaf lemonade 4/5."
4,"The fully loaded nachos is unbeatable in taste at cream centre. Cheese corn balls could have better in taste. Garlic breads, fries, sizzler, pasta was v.tasty. The pizza was another unbeatable item from the menu. It's a really nice place to enjoy with ur family and friends. The staff is v.friendly and gives u very nice service."
4,"Cream Centre Veg Bistro- Proudly Veg restaurant in Mumbai. I visited their outlet in Phoenix Marketcity at Kurla. I had a great experience in the Cream Centre at City Mall.

We had Veg Manchow soup and Spring Veggie Soup. Both are good in taste. Then we had Delhi chaat and papdi chaat. Both chaats were okay. Not so great.

In the Main course, we had Veg Nazami and Dal Makhni with Tandoori Roti and Naan. The food was delicious and flavoursome.
Not spicy not oily. All ingredients were fresh and the spices were perfect. Don't miss their CARROT PICKLEüòç best in taste. They also served vinegar onions.
I also had lemonade which was refreshing for me.
The quantity was good enough for the two of us. We loved the quality and taste.

The ambience and seating arrangements were great.
Must appreciate their hospitality esp Manager Mr. Raees Deshpande, Chef Mubin and Deepak who served us. Other staff were also courteous and attentive.  Thank you for serving us.

I recommend this place for great food experience."
4,"We have always been a fan of chole bhature served here. But you must also try their sizzlers and nachos. Cream centre is one of its kind pure veg restaurant also serving jain food. Don't forget to order sizzling brownie for you dessert. We had ordered their cheese corn balls, oriental sizzler, mint mojito, lemonade, and sizzling brownie. The staff here is excellent and the food is great. Anyone who knows Cream centre knows that the cost is worth the quality."
3,"Actually a tussle to rate it between 3 and 3.5
The Cream Centre restaurant st first look is neat and spacious but you can‚Äôt go Gaga over the ambience! It‚Äôs in between the average and wow factor
Ambience gets a 3 on 5
Ordered
Soup: They have only two variants. Decided to skip the manchow and try the Spring Vegetable one. Split it between two and for the first time saw that uneven quantities were served.
Taste Was decent ! It‚Äôs light and soya based with pieces of paneer. Found the flavours  just right
Starters : the stuffed Tandoori Subz wanton was tasty but quite greasy
It‚Äôs been a while that my plate got coated with oil

Then the server gets us finger bowls which are in COLD water! On pointing it out he says Okay ????
The manager apologises but the fingerbowls in hot water don‚Äôt arrive and we leave!
Their Cream Centre icecream outside gives you a 10 percent discount on production of restaurant bill.
Cost: 620 without Service charge
Overall Rating: 3 as the restaurant can be summed up in one word : Decent
Not cheap but not over the top pricing either"
5,Best original Indian food
5,Awesome lunches.
5,
5,"The Beer Caf√© is a fantastic spot for beer lovers! The variety of international and domestic beers is impressive, and the ambiance is perfect for both casual hangouts and group gatherings. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, always happy to recommend a good beer pairing. The food menu complements the drinks well‚Äîgreat snacks, pizzas, and North Indian options.

The service was quick, and the atmosphere was lively yet comfortable. Highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a great place to relax with friends over a cold beer. Will definitely be coming back!"
3,The 1+1 offer on Craft beers on the board outside is not applicable on all the craft beers. Very misleading. A.C. was OFF during the afternoon. They start it only around 5ish. Cheapos.
1,"Had a really bad experience at this place. There was practically no service‚Äî we had to keep calling the staff repeatedly to get any attention. The waiters were either absent or completely uninterested.

To make things worse, the food was ridiculously overpriced and definitely not worth the money. For the price they charge, we expected much better quality and service.

Overall, not a place I‚Äôd recommend. There are far better options nearby where you actually get what you pay for.

Let me know if you want to tweak it!"
1,"I been working in the hospitality industry for 30 years and now based in USA has a food and beverage director.
Me and my wife just came in for a beer rather then greeting us MR Aditya before taking our order. Tells us the mode of payment and the service charge and said we need to inform the customer before taking their order has its company policy. It's humilating this is the worst I have ever ever heard he spoiled our entire evening. Thankyou i will rather go to poptates or rainforeat ot Irish pub. But will never come here again."
1,"I just saw other reviews. Now I know, am not the only one who suffered.
Pathetic service. Bad housekeeping in restaurants service areas. Beer cans and boxes lying there. Unclean look. No attention to orders. This is when hardly two tables to attend on Monday afternoon.
Would not recommend anytime to go‚Ä¶useless spend of 2K."
1,"I purchased 4 frankies - veg tikka, paneer makhanie, veg classic and one of sheswan. All 4 frankees were pathetic. Classic was extremely bad and dry. Upon asking the shop person he said this is dry only as it just has chatni. I left and threw the frankie. Wouldnt recomend this food to anyone!"
2,"I recently tried the Paneer Frankee Roll at Tibs Frankee Rolls, and it was disappointing. The roll wasn't tasty or filling, especially considering the price they charged. It had a very sour taste, and it seemed like they added too much chaat masala, which overpowered the flavor. Honestly, even roadside frankees taste better than this. It didn‚Äôt meet my expectations at all, and I won't be returning for this dish. For the price, the quality and taste just weren't worth it."""
1,I tried their egg frankie today and it was not worth the price there is no taste and any good ingredients in frankie no sauce at all only onion and one egg rolled inside the frankie plz try to make it a little better for customer's preference
5,"So today I visited Tibbs frankie of Phoenix mall Kurla, Mumbai. I ordered and made my payment. We received the order on time as well. I had scanned and paid the bill that is I used QR code. While serving food the service staff Mr. Javed gives me cash of my total bill. I was stunned and when I asked he mentioned I paid twice the bill amount through scan.
Such an honest man. Good deeds.
These small things really matters in today‚Äôs bad world of people around.
Thanks Javed
Kudos"
5,"Tibb's has always been serving the best rolls for more than a decade now.
Loved each and every roll.
Delicious filling, soft well cooked maida/wheat.
They have a wheat option that itself makes it amazing.

They have a special month end offer. Last Wednesday of each month you get all rolls for only Rs 99.

Taste : 5/5
Value for money : 5/5

Happy rolling to you !!!!"
4,"It was hot outside. I went inside the mall to cool down. I happen to drop in to CAFE COFFEE DAY located at the lower ground. We ordered Vietnamese Iced coffee and Spicy Mango slush. The taste was great, staff were polite. Service needs to improve. For instance, the table should be wipe clean and dry and ready for the next visitors. No Tissue paper box in any of the table."
5,I love cold coffee ‚òï I tried hot coffe as well . It was also very nice and good . Pheonix R city mall . Two item price were 650 rs/- to 700 rs /-
1,"I‚Äôve always enjoyed sitting at CCD outlets because of the cleanliness, the pleasant aromas, the lively crowd, and of course, the coffee. However, visiting this particular outlet made me regret going there. The cleanliness was lacking‚Äîeww! üò£ The place had a very bad aroma, and the staff was unprofessional, talking loudly at the counter and behaving oddly. To top it off, the Devil‚Äôs Own whipped cream was melted. üòí

It was a total bummer, and I‚Äôm rating this one star ‚≠ê for everything."
4,"This is one kind of Ccd branch which serves the food quantity and quality as per the money they charge.
Had been here multiple times and you can order anything. Paneer sandwich and cofee are best served. I also love their chocolate crossaint"
1,Worst customer service and bad iced tea literally 80% is just ice...and doesn't have any lemon flavour...order taker is super rude and annoying...with such a face that seems like she doesn't even wanna work...gave and order then she asked to download ccd app on that said that we don't need any discounts...so we thought she went ahead with the order...but 5 mins later she asks again what do you want...and after giving the order again she starts searching for her lost phone instead of giving us our order...and have the audacity to make that crooked face and hand gestures like 'chal ja' to go and have a seat instead of verbally saying... seriously y'all need to check who y'all are hiring for the job...don't even wanna give one star
3,"If you are hungry you can try this place but there is only issue there is no availability for seating.

Chicken noodles, Veg noodles, Chicken Wings and many more.

Best quality and quantity
Schezwan Noodles üíï .. Perfect noodles lunch box with regular size. Price : 180/- .....Noodles are not only amazing but delicious ü§ó"
4,"Wok express

4,"Wok express is spreading its wings slowly but firmly across the city.. Most of them are like takeaway joints .. I happened to visit their bkc outlet on Sunday eve, my first experience at wok express, n it was good.. Wok express do serve oriental food at very reasonable rates.. The bkc outlet has 3 tables n few chairs to sit.. It's a very clean hygienic place.. I started here with zesty lemon n coriander soup.. This healthy n delicious soup had refreshing combination of lemon, coriander n veggies in it with a thick consistency .. We tried crispy tempura roll sushi n they were scrumptious.. Carrot, Onion, Tempura flour and Sesame oil rolled in sweet and sour rice are served along with soya sauce.. It was too good n one of the best sushi I have ever had.. Had kung pao potatoes n it was also very good .. Baby potatoes, cooked in Chinese sauce, are served along with roasted peanuts on it.. It was delectable n quite filling one.. We also tried chilli Paneer bao n I found it ok.. Chopped pieces of succulent Paneer are marinated well in spicy chilli basil sauce n are served in super soft fluffy bao.. I found it too much saucy to my liking.. Wok express is known for its wok n they here do serve some really amazing wok our here.. One can directly order for chef recommended wok box which I guess will be great to do.. One can also customise n choose between rice n noodles, sauces, veggies n condiments n prepare wok according to their liking if you are particular about what u eat.. Also there are sizes to choose from n along with combo deals with drinks it's very reasonable.. I had Bangkok ramen noodles n it was too good.. This wok box had ramen noodles along with veggies n sauce were topped with burnt garlic.. It was hot, tasty n treat to my taste buds.. Food overall was good here n let me warn u if u don't like medium spicy or spicy food this place is not for you.. We also tried popcorn n peach iced bubble tea n I found both to be good in flavour but frankly Tapioca pearls in it were not that great n i will recommend to try bubble tea without tapioca pearls in it.. Will like the management to work on tapioca pearls n improve on it.. Service was good n staff were very helpful with their recommendations.. As food is prepared fresh expect 10/15 mins wait for ur order.. Overall it was decent experience out here n I'm surely trying their other woks served out here in future

My recommendations - Zesty lemon n coriander soup, crispy tempura roll sushi, kung pao potatoes, Bangkok ramen noodles"
4,"One of the cheapest and tasty noodles if you order online
Its easy now a days for evryone to order online bt to get this taste its very difficult
I havnt visitd yet this restaurant bt as i have ordered and eaten i know this is going to be very impressive
Hope to see soon
Thank you Wok express"
1,I have found a piece of a torn finger tip of a rubber glove in my food. I ordered Chinese Wok via Swiggy and there is no number listed for a direct complaint to Chinese Wok Kalina. Utterly disgusting and irresponsible! I have sent a complaint to FSSAI.
5,"We visited Rajdhani Thali for dinner to try their special winter menu, and it was a delightful experience! The variety offered was impressive, catering to both taste and tradition. The quality of the food was excellent, and every dish was flavorful, making it truly worth the price. A perfect spot for a wholesome meal with family or loved ones. Highly recommend this place for its delicious food and warm hospitality. A must-visit for thali lovers!"
5,"Clean and teasty, promo -50%. Don't miss!

It was great experience.  I am pure vegetarian and although I am not from India (and this is my first restaurant in the country), I love Indian food and during my trips always checking Indian restaurants in different countries (Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Russia, Nepal, Maldives and etc.) . Definitely  the experience here was one of the best.

On Tuesday they have nice promo 50%. It's worth!

Thanks Mr. Narendra  for warm welcome and all team for great job as they do.

P.s. located in food court zone."
5,"It was my first time eating at Rajdhani, also my first time trying thali. I'm not familiar with the names, but everything was delicious, and vegetarian. The dining experience started with a handwash, assisted by the staff and then the food was carried out one by one. This was such a fun experience for me!"
4,"I loved the food no denying that I remembered there was a prayer room at Phoenix so I thought I'll pray and then enjoy the meal however I didn't know the prayer room was shut down so I asked the Rajdhani Manager to allow me some space in the corner to pray they obliged and a manager stood infront of me while I was praying I don't know the reason for him standing infront of me either so no one sees me or so that no one crosses infront of me while I'm praying but I'd love to think of it as a positive way that he stood so that no one crossed infront of me while I prayed I was really very thankful for them to allow me to pray for those few mins.
Coming back to food it was amazing different bhaji's some spicy, some sweet and some perfect to our taste the only thing I didn't like was limited Aam ras in an unlimited thali."
3,Hospitality was good as usual like in all their outlets. It was less crowded for weekend. I realised for the first time that the overall meal taste and quality was NOT up to the mark. Most of the items were not hot which was surprising. The main attraction Surti Undiyo was lacking taste and appeal. The worst part of Jilebi which was soggy and how can one serve such second hand quality in Rajdhani restaurant. When the person came for second serve I requested him to bring it crispy and he disappeared after that‚Ä¶ Rather than dumping the plate with more number of items they should focus on taste and quality. Looks like the main chef was on a holiday ‚Ä¶. They served Bisleri bottle and the server said all are included in the meal. Then a person came asking which one we want Kesar Lassi/ Jaljeera/ Lemon drink and then I realised that they are additional charge when the bill came‚Ä¶ at least they should inform us in advance‚Ä¶ overall I had a very below average experience and disappointed with their poor taste and quality of many items. Hope they critically look at and correct the gaps and bring back their glory
5,"I recently stopped by the Subway at Phoenix Market City in Kurla West, Mumbai, and had a wonderful experience! I really enjoyed being able to customize my sandwich with various bread, veggies, sauces, and protein options to suit my preferences.

The prices were quite reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food. It‚Äôs an excellent option for a quick, filling meal without spending too much.

The staff was friendly and attentive, making sure I was satisfied with my choices.

All in all, this Subway offers a delicious, affordable, and customizable meal for anyone at Phoenix Market City."
1,I ordered Chocolate Mint and I received Iced green tea! I was looking forward to drink milk based not green tea based! Very very disappointed ! Very very unhappy with the service ! Even teriyaki sandwich was not as per the standards really disappointed mannnn ! Tried calling them not connecting and atleast they could have contacted me and ask if I‚Äôm okay with the alternative option if they do not have something ! I literally threw the green tea instead I could have ordered coke or something! Disappointment is an understatement for what I am feeling !
1,"The service was so terrible. He's refusing to make some Subs. He's refusing to customize a normal sub. The bread was broken. He's adding add-ons which have additional charges (double chicken, cheese etc) without asking. Never expected a mall outlet to be THIS bad."
5,I just Subway Sandwich for the very first time I tried their Sub of the day Tandoori Toffu it was so fresh and yummy veggies were crunchy i loved it
1,Worst food ever good delivered from the subway their were no veges except cucumber and tomato and even cucumber was bitter even the mayo and mustered sauce  was so less that it was better it is not included after requesting and mentioning. This is the worst food i have got from the subway as i order regularly worst service and also took more than 1hr and 15 min to deliver via uber worst food. even after calling on given number for 10 times their were no one to pick up worst customer service ever
4,First be clear it's New York styled pizza so it's not going to be that punchy and spicy what we call chapatta like others so first timers would feel that something is lacking but that might not really be true. It's the way it is quality wise I would say for money you are paying it's better than dominoes and pizza hut. If you feel you need more flavour try seasoning itüòâ. Try it once for sure.
1,"Was excited to try Sbarro again after all these years and this was such a let down. We ordered a slice of their double cheese pizza and it tasted terrible ‚Äì no flavour, hardly any sauce, and the cheese tasted like cardboard. The texture was really off too even though the pizza was hot"
2,"I had ordered a Pizza & Stromboli.
Taste is okay, pizza crust is thin & well baked however didn't find it much flavourful.
Stromboli is worth a try. I had ordered Chicken stromboli, but it had more veggies & hardly any chicken. The stromboli bread was really good it had well baked layers & was fluffy.
However, many offers which were displayed on the board where not available at this outlet."
1,Very disgusting flovour of pizza employees has no behavior to talk properly first time I order for sabrro buttt its failed waste of money and time and de didn‚Äôt wear their mistake and give a better way of solution smell is very weird soo how can we eat this
1,"I ordered from zomato, i placed an order for 3 pizzas, i recieved only one, i tried calling the restaurant but it's saying that the number is not valid. If you are going to open a restaurant atleast keep a valid number, what if there is an emergency. I rate this overall a one star because what kind of bs service are they giving us. On top of that their restraunt is located an hour away, how could they expect me to send the delivery guy back and forth just to get my order and delay it by 2 hrs"
5,"A game zone which has plenty to offer.
It's 2 storey, ground one offering Archade and the 1st floor offers Bowling,  Sports Bar and some Archade games.

The recharge counter is available on both the floors.

They bowling section is huge and can accomodate lot of big groups easily.
The in-house cafe (AMOEBA SPORTS BAR) has a wide range of options for food and drinks..the ambience is too good but it's slightly pricey compared to the portion size. Discounts are available when paid through Zomato/Dineout.

Staff is very friendly and available for assistance all the time.

Tuesday's are the best time to avail discounts on games including bowling.
This has been our go to place post work and quite a stress buster."
5,"A perfect place to feel nostalgic and enjoy all the arcade games and bowling. The food and drinks here are just amazing. We had sooo much fun, enjoyed to the fullest, won so many tickets and gifts. Best place to have a fun day with your squad."

5/5 ‚Äì A Fantastic Spot for Fun, Food, and Friends!

I had an amazing time at Amoeba Sports Bar! From the moment we walked in, the vibe was energetic and welcoming. The staff was super friendly and made sure we were comfortable throughout.

We started off with a few rounds of arcade games‚Äîsuper fun and well-maintained. After working up an appetite, we moved to our table and ordered a mix of finger foods and pizzas. The food was delicious, especially the chicken buns and the cheesy bacon fries! Drinks were reasonably priced, and they had a solid selection of cocktails and beer.

What I loved most was the combination of everything‚Äîgood music, live sports on big screens, tasty food, and a fun crowd. It‚Äôs the perfect place to hang out with friends, especially for a weekend chill session.

Highly recommended if you're looking for a lively sports bar that offers more than just drinks!
~ Thankyou chatgpt"
4,"A must visit if you love finger food and appetisers.
Very vibrant atmosphere.
Food taste-quality perfect.
Funzone as well with bowling area.
Portion is less.. can serve only 2.
Extra charges for dips and sauce.
Table size is small for large groups."
5,Recently visited amoeba sports bar with my friends and I was surprised by the amount of arcade games they have.. bowling and many games..but we were there for IPL.. they have big IPL screening and buy one get one free on drinks. I really the enjoyed here. Must visit for sure
1,Hate this place because of unhygienic they have it is really concerning they have cockroaches roaming around inside the outlet and it's very disturbing to see it can cause serious harm and infection to the people think if it is in the outlet how much cockroaches and other bugs will be inside the kitchen I request phoenix staff to take a strict action against this and also The manager Named Archana was not helpful neither the staff was people be aware of where you are going and eating the food from people are feeding there kids you can see in the video and also eating at place like this burger king is a big name maintain your staff or the video will reach to the food safety officer or something kindly do something because we are paying price for better quality
1,"Did order twice on my same day visit from this location last Sunday

Found kitchen staff and fulfillment staff unable to cater the demand

Instead of large Sprite I got something
like carbonated water it didn't taste like Sprite.
I raise complaint through app but no reply or any thing.

Order takes time

Place not clean enough."
2,"This Burger King outlet is the worst ! Terrible service and wrong orders being taken , the place is so dirty not at all clean .
Ordered a Paneer royale burger and they took 25 min to serve it.
At first they got a wrong order , gave a planner wrap instead of a burger .
Messy tables , dirty floors !
Management and staff needs to be trained to keep the place clean !"
4,"Good service, staff is polite & well-behaved, chicken whopper / veg whopper is a must try, so is their choco lava cake, & thick strawberry shake is a must have...
I don't like burger King french fries all their outlet have pathetic fries,"
4,"I am usually not a Burger person, but ever since I had Burger King' Burger, I like Burger.

This place is spacious and there is enough place to sit inside and outside the outlet.

Service is good.

We just had Veggie Burger there and we liked it."
4,"‚Ä¢ I recently tried ordering Chinese food from the Chinese Wok restaurant, and it was truly amazing! üòÄ

‚Ä¢ I ordered their rice and gravy dish, and I must say, it was incredibly tasty. The flavors were on point, and the overall experience was delightful. üçöüëå

‚Ä¢ I highly recommend giving them a try for some delicious Chinese cuisine!

üëâ Terms and conditions ü§ê

‚Ä¢ Only for non vegetarian ü§≠"
4,"Nice place to grab a quick wok meal. Offers wide range of products. The food is oily, you need to make sure what you are ordering else it's easy to be surprised with the food. Offers beverage with bubbles which taste like tamarind. Should try if you are a lover of wok or momos. Offers good range."
2,Asked for non spicy and they still gave me spicy and I can‚Äôt eat it
5,"what we ordered:
.
Make your own wok bowl (size medium)
.
1.Chicken wings in kung pao sauce
.
2. Flat wheat noodles with chicken in a sweet and smoky japanese teriyaki sauce.
.
2. Steamed rice with chicken in black bean sauce
.
Wok express has some of the amazing noodles and rice wok bowls with huge choices of sauce. Every dish is cooked perfectly and you can also choose to make your own bowl instead of recommended bowls.
Head towards your nearest wok express outlet and try some amazing chinese and japanese food."
2,"Peri peri pizza is the worst and not happening thing you will taste. I have had peri peri paneer pizza on the recommendations of the attendant on the counter. And I still regret my trust on that lady. How can peri peri be so soury

Thank God I also ordered garlic bread that saved my mood. Definitely would not recommend to anyone."
1,"This is the worst experience we have faced in this store. I purchased 4 4 course meal, I am regular customer of domino‚Äôs and I haven‚Äôt faced such issues in other stores but only in this particular kurla phoenix market city store. I told her for takeaway even after that she refused and gave in dine in box. They took full amount and didn‚Äôt gave us the Pepsi and saying that Pepsi is not available. I think the people working there are fooling customers."
1,"Absolutely the worst experience ever with Domino's! They are blatantly overcharging for their subpar food, which has gone downhill in terms of quality. The pizza was soggy, tasteless, and looked like it was thrown together with zero care. To make matters worse, the staff was extremely rude and unprofessional, treating customers as if we were a nuisance rather than paying customers. It‚Äôs shocking how little they value their customers. For the price they charge, I expected at least decent food and courteous service, but they managed to fail at both. I‚Äôm never ordering from Domino's again and wouldn‚Äôt recommend them to anyone. They‚Äôve completely lost my trust."
1,"Extremely disappointing customer service. My 14-year-old daughter went to order a pizza, and the staff member, Sangita, was unprofessional and inattentive. She repeatedly left in the middle of taking the order and, instead of informing my daughter that thin-crust Margherita pizza was unavailable, she unilaterally changed the order to a regular Margherita without consent.

To make matters worse, no bill was provided, so we were unaware of the change until the pizza was delivered. When my daughter pointed out the mistake, the staff refused to take responsibility and insisted that she had ordered the regular version. Only after persistent questioning did they admit to the change, yet neither the employee nor the manager showed any apology or willingness to correct the issue.

Such lack of transparency and disregard for customer satisfaction is unacceptable. I would not recommend this place unless they improve their service and professionalism."
2,the order was marked ready even when it wasn't prepared and we had to wait for 10 minutes at the counter and the choco lava took too long to get prepped. the chicken pizza was topped with cheese as if they were doing us a favour and wouldn't recommend this outlet to anyone
1,"It was the worst Dominos I have ever seen, very dirty. They did not even wipe the top of the counter where the order was placed, there were human hair around, and the drawer where the lid of the coke glass and the straw were kept was disgusting. We ordered boneless chicken and paid for it and after it was made and given, they gave us chicken with bones."
5,"HEROES is a gem! The food is incredible‚Äîfull of flavor and perfectly cooked. The service? Absolutely top-notch, with friendly and attentive staff who make sure you have everything you need. The sheesha selection is vast and smooth, making for a fantastic experience. Highly recommend for great food, amazing service, and a chill atmosphere!"
1,"I recently visited heroesss and unfortunately, I left extremely disappointed. The service was incredibly slow, despite not being busy. It took over 20 minutes just for someone to take our drink orders, and even longer to get our food. The staff seemed uninterested, and we had to flag down a server multiple times for simple requests like water refills. The food arrived cold, and when we mentioned it, no one seemed concerned or offered any solution.

Overall, the lack of attention and poor customer service made what could have been an enjoyable meal very frustrating. I won‚Äôt be returning anytime soon."
3,Food has improved. Service is good. Just the ambience is too flashy to eyes. That constant led floating on the ceiling gives me headache and makes me leave the place soon.
5,"Heroesss is a superhero themed lounge located in Chembur. Its a big place on the 4th floor. The main theme of this place is the Superhero theme, which is very subtle almost visible to the unbenknownst.

I was here on a weekday for dinner and was quite surprised to find the place almost occupied. So currently they have a special IPL screening, well WPL but then they will be screening the IPL as well, along with some amazing offers on drinks as well.

The ambience is subtle yet enough to be pleasant, its quite lit during the day due to natural light and dimly lit during the night with disco lights flickering everywhere. It really is a good place to just sit and chill with friends and family.

We tried a couple of mocktails and in food we had a few starters and some main course. The drinks were good, syrup based but enjoyable nonetheless. The food was super delicious as well. All in all it was a fine evening with good food and drinks!"

5,Best place to beat the summer. their icecream taste so fresh and so delicious . I loved the strawberry and tender coconut flavour.their nutty baklava with malai icecrram was so good. their baklava had lot of nuts and was crunchy and tasty. also this summer their mango shake with fresh mango pieces is a good option to try. it was too yummy.
5,"TenderFresh offers a delightful variety of ice creams and sundaes that are rich in flavor and perfectly crafted. The atmosphere is cozy, and the service is quick, making it a great spot for a sweet treat. I loved the sundae I tried ‚Äì creamy, indulgent, and loaded with toppings. Definitely worth visiting for anyone with a sweet tooth!"
5,"Tender Fresh is an ice cream Parlour that serves some of the best and amazing variety of flavours out here!

They provide you with various type of Fruit ice cream.Also the shakes available with them are awesome.

Great experience!!!!seasonal and non seasonal dry fruits chocolate flavors avilable interior quite eye catchy and great staff..

You just love this place! Highly recommended!"
5,"I recently visited Tender Fresh Ice Cream, they offer an impressive variety of unique and delicious flavors that are really authentic, natural and cater to all tastes. The Mango and Chikoo scoops were refreshingly sweet and creamy, while the bold Chili Guava provided an exciting mix of spice and fruitiness. The Baklava Ice Cream was a rich, indulgent treat with its nutty, honeyed layers. But the standout was definitely the Mangalore Special Gadbad, a flavorful medley of ice cream, fruits, and nuts that‚Äôs perfect for sharing. With so many flavors to choose from, Tender Fresh truly delivers a delightful ice cream experience."
5,"if you're looking for the perfect dessert spot,,,Tender fresh in kalina, Santacruz is a hidden gem..We tried their many signature shakes and desserts like

1)Nuttu baklava:- the nutty baklava is as name suggests fully loaded with nuts and topped with fresh vanilla ice cream...must try

2)chilly guava:- I m highly recommended this scoop of ice cream with zero preservatives and made with natural guava..10/10

3)The granola sundae:- presentation wise 10/9...as its perfectly balanced tastes üòã

4)kaju anjeer cone:- The taste is unique,rich and creamy...

5)choco chips cone:- must try it once all chocolate lovers..tastes so chocolatey

6)mango shake:- made with natural mango,tastes amazing as its free of added calories and preservatives..10/10

The taste of their ice creams are quite innovative and interesting...we loved it.and highly recommended to my family and friends"
4,"There are different types of cakes at the monginis cake shop in kalina.There are various types of cakes,and snacks to buy from this shop. Had buyed chocolate cake from here and  had also bought wafers from this shop.The cake was very delicious and the wafers were ok.
#monginis"
2,"Since college I have eaten there and 2 years back the shop owner changed. This new one is extremely rude and has no sense of managing loyal customers.
Today I bought a butterscotch and zebra troat, later was okay but former was so bad - it felt like it was days old, based was hard and it was not smelling good.
I tried giving her a feedback so they can check the pending products but she was very rude and made a comment, ""Veg base aisa hi hota hai"" as if I was eating it for the first time.
More than 2 times I have faced experience and now I'm done with this outlet."
1,"Horrible and extremely rude service by Monginis. Firoz‚Äôs son and his wife are extremely unprofessional to any customer. Purchased an item from Monginis Kalina in the afternoon and the item was stale and smelling, the owner refused to give me a refund and asked me to write a review on his book which makes no sense at all. The service and the quality of products have degraded and they sell all stale items in the store. First of all there‚Äôs no respect to any customer, secondly he‚Äôs not even accepting that his products are not fresh and not even ready to consume his own products when we said that the paneer roll is spoilt and smelling. Even after so many years in Kalina they have a lot of attitude and no sense of talking. Nobody should ever visit here because the entire shop and the staff are useless."
4,"An Excellllllent cake shop with a SUUUuuupeeeerb variety of cakes and munchies. Very reasonable prices. Never got anything stale from them. And whatever l have purchased from the shop, has never been a disappointment.  They do deserve 5‚≠ês, but l have reduced 1‚≠ê because of the attitude of the staff. When you work in an outlet like this,  you need to be more friendly and courteous.  Please don't put down the name of such a prestigious brand with your attitude.
************
Another point to bring to your attention.  This is not regarding any particular outlet.  It's an overall review.  The boxes being used nowadays to take the cakes home, are of verrrrrrry weak quality.  By the time the cake gets home,  the box gets bent and part of the beautifully decorated cake, gets stuck to the sides or the top of the box, and it makes a big mess. Looking forward to getting back the strong boxes Monginis used to give earlier.
Now please don't send me this same reply, that you guys generally give to everyone  ... ...
{Customer satisfaction is very important to
us, so we sincerely apologize for your bad experience. We take all feedback seriously

90% of the time,  these words just remain in the comments section,  without any action being taken.  Respond back to me, ONLY IF some action is taken,  or else, it's ok, we will manage with messed up cakes reaching home."
1,"Ever since the owner has changed the quality of the product is third grade
Butterscotch pastry is always stale and if we complain about it to the owner he will give stupid reasons I think its time to boycott kalina mongines cheap quality products"
4,"During an official dinner, I had the pleasure of experiencing the dinner buffet at O22 Restaurant, located at Trident Hotel in Bandra Kurla Complex, Mumbai. The hotel is a luxurious 5-star property that offers a wonderful dining experience.

The dinner buffet at O22 featured an impressive spread that catered to all tastes. The selection ranged from fresh salads and hearty soups to flavorful pastas and aromatic biryanis. The variety of global and Indian cuisines was remarkable, ensuring there was something for everyone.

One of the standout features of the buffet was the dessert section. The spread included Indian sweets like pistachio barfis and date pudding, along with Western delights such as panna cotta, cr√®me caramel, ice creams, and brownies. Each dessert was well-crafted and provided a perfect ending to the meal.

The ambiance at O22 was elegant and welcoming, complemented by attentive service. The staff was courteous and ensured that all guests had a comfortable dining experience.

Overall, O22 at Trident BKC is an excellent choice for anyone looking to enjoy an upscale buffet in Mumbai. Whether for a corporate gathering or a personal celebration, the combination of diverse cuisine, elegant setting, and impeccable service makes it a memorable dining experience.

Would highly recommend visiting!"
5,Awesome breakfast and very good options. Fresh orange juice‚Ä¶.liked it
5,"Very good spread

I tried their Sunday buffet spread and it was amazing, plenty of options for vegetarians with a global as well as regional cuisines

Most bookings come with complementary breakfast which is also great"
5,Amazing breakfast experience at trident bkc. Visited with my family. On of the best breakfasts we had. It was symphony of good foo and great staff.

Staff is very prompt and warm always ready to help.
We being a blogger couple and they treated us and others the same way so I was happy to know that everyone is equally important for them.
The food was perfect. Flawless. Nothing to point your fingers at.
I would def love to visit again for invite for special menus/days.

4,"I recently had an incredible dining experience at Maya in Trident BKC. The food was absolutely delicious, from the intricately spiced curries to the decadent desserts ‚Äì every dish was a treat for the senses. The presentation was beautiful, and each bite showcased a depth of flavor that left a lasting impression.

The service was equally impressive. A big thank you to Saqlain, Asif, Sakshi, and Mami, who made our experience memorable with their warm hospitality and attentive service. They went above and beyond to ensure we had a wonderful time. I highly recommend Maya for anyone looking to indulge in an exceptional dining experience!"
4,"The place was relatively empty on a Tuesday night. The manager was extremely courteous and helpful. The Black Daal, the Chole and even the Paneer was excellent. The ambience is ok. The quantities are superb for a 5 star hotel and surely worth visiting."
5,"Visited with my entire family recently, they recommended some very authentic dishes. Their menu has some very authentic dishes from various parts of the country.

The food was delicious, and the service from Saqlain, Sujal, Prathay, Ronak and some other members was very impressive, they intuitively took care of all members - for instance, brought a pillow to make sure my grandpa is more comfortable, assured my father the food is halal.

Overall it was a great experience!"
1,"Extremely expensive food which is overly spicy and all this served by a seemingly inexperienced staff.
Went there as a party of 24 for a very special occasion.
The hotel looks great with a huge chandelier and fresh lilies in the middle of the lobby.
The restaurant looked promising but we were in for a letdown.
Started with tomato shorba which was good and everything went downhill after that.
Had chicken and prawns in appetizers which were okay but the main course was a HUGE disappointment.
The dessert are also very mediocre.
We wanted to talk to the chef who instead of accepting his fault started defending himself.
Will not miss going there."
5,The head chef here needs to open a place in Dubai and London as the food is that good. The Kadi and Kichri are simply the best I have ever had and I would now want to ensure I eat here at every visit to Mumbai. Worth booking and worth a visit. They are willing to offer items Al la carte and off menu as well. The tahlis all looked great but would have been too much as they don‚Äôt allow you to share one between us which is strange.
4,Tasty food
2,Ok
5,
4,"Food quality is very good. Lassi must try however the Malai in Lassi is kind of tasting as ghee which some people will not like but we enjoyed it.

Multiple veg and non veg option also they have hard drinks.

Ac non ac proper dhaba feel with khatiya machan.. go with group or couple you will.enjoy it for sure."
4,"I went there for a Family Dinner. We took the table in the open area near parking.

Food was great and the service was quiet fast.

The best thing about this place was that they served food in steel utensils. This is the best thing that I loved about this place.

I did not like the ambience as much, but that is my personal view.

Ample to space for parking and sitting.

Washrooms were clean too."
5,"This dining experience perfectly blended great food and ambiance, making it unforgettable. Whether you‚Äôre looking to celebrate a special occasion, enjoy a quiet dinner, or simply indulge in quality cuisine, this place is worth every moment.

The staff was dressed in traditional attire, further enhancing the authentic feel. They were attentive and made great recommendations.

It was a nostalgic and satisfying experience that celebrated the essence of Indian roadside dining.

Highly recommended for those seeking hearty food and a genuine dhaba vibe!"
5,"Recently visited this place on a sunday sunny  afternoon on my way back to mumbai
Was unsure if they have a ac sitting section available
Jus happen 2 ask and oh my god it was very peaceful and calming and the food is soul soothing
Jus happen 2 have a desi meal on a sunday afternoon with rabdi jalebi in deserts along with warm gulab jamun

Ordered the following things
1. Mushroom tikka 5/5
2.lasooni palak 3/5 big chunks of Mushroom deep fried could have been mashed or grated it small
3.sarsoda saag 5/5
And in breads
4.missi roti
5. Butter rumali
6. Laccha paratha
7. Punjabi lassi amazing can be shared by 3 of dem easily (5/5)
8.cheese garlic naan for starters
Deserts
9. Rabdi jalebi 4/5
10. Gulab jamun

Graded service 4/5 as felt it was slow for a sunday afternoon around 3ish
Sitting is amazing chair sitting and sofa kind of dhaba sitting under ac in a summer afternoon is a bliss"
4,"The whole vibe and ambience is pretty good. The staff is attentive and polite. The food is a bit expensive but the taste could have been better. Other than that, a good place to dine-in with your friends and family."
5,"Had a great experience at Subway! Jyoti was amazing‚Äîcourteous, quick to understand my needs, and super efficient. She made my visit enjoyable with her professionalism and warm service. Keep it up!

Visited again after 4 months - once again, amazing service by Kaushal and Praful. Keep it up!"
3,"I ordered a chicken teriyaki sub and it was okay. I felt the quality of chicken was too less . But with pickles, jalape√±os and olives the sub tasted delicious. The option of choosing a multigrain honey oat sub deserves a brownie point."
4,"Fresh, clean and good service. Guys who make the subs are polite and friendly, for noobs it was frustrating what to choose but they help with enthusiasm. Personally If someone is the first time to visit, try their Teriyaki and add tandoori sauce one of the best according to me."
1,"Very irresponsible staff. I had ordered take away of jain but they gave me tofu with onion and garlic.
Inspite of clearing giving them instructions and checking with them more than 50 times they mismatched the order. It takes less than a minute to check while packing but carelessness.

Really disappointed."
4,"It is just behind McDonald's, in the same building. Little difficult to locate as it lies in a corner of the building within which it is located.

Parking can be a hassle. Also, no washrooms or wash basins.

The place is well maintained and is pretty clean. The quality is also maintained and on par with what I've had at other Subway outlets. There are only 3 tables, so less seating within the restaurant.

Compared to other Fast Food Chains, it's quite expensive, but worth it once a while as they have lot of options to customize your sandwich and is comparatively healthy as well.

Overall, a nice place to visit."

5,"A Classic Vegetarian Delight in Matunga

Classic Fast Food, located opposite Don Bosco High School in Matunga East, is a hidden gem for anyone craving fresh and hygienic vegetarian food. With a legacy dating back to 1989, they‚Äôve maintained quality and service consistently.

The ambiance is clean and welcoming‚Äîgreat for casual dining or small gatherings. They also offer a party hall for 25‚Äì50 people, making it ideal for birthdays, kitty parties, or seminars. I tried their kulhad chai, and it was rich, aromatic, and served beautifully.

Service is prompt, staff is polite, and they‚Äôre available on Swiggy, Zomato, and Justdial for online orders. Free home delivery is a bonus!

Highly recommended if you're in or around Kings Circle. A perfect spot for tasty, affordable vegetarian meals!"
4,Very good for veg people. It's very clean and hygienic. I am a regular customer. The outer space is fantastic. The inside is a little bit hot. South Indian food is very good.
3,"Aaron's Final Rating is 3.5

Visited this restaurant after almost 15 years. It is situated opposite Don Bosco Shrine Matunga.

Went during chai time around 5 PM. So didn't try much. Ideally good for South Indian dishes. It's not on the main road which means a bit away from the hustle bustle of people and vehicles.

All in all, a good experience and quite nostalgic. And I do recommend this place."
4,"It's good place to have delicious and tasty food. Only place is not so quiet and bit crowdy. But, taste is good. Price is high comparatively with respect to ambience.

Dishes tried-
Lassi (too good)
masala papad (not good)
Chili paneer dry (good)
Medu vada (good)"
4,"Nice place where they take care of their customers. The pav bhaji was nice, and the staff was good. They always check the table to see if customers need anything, and they are available at that moment. The price is a little bit high, but service and quality matter."
4,"I had a wonderful experience at Rasna Punjab! The food was absolutely delicious, with bold flavors and just the right amount of spice. The Manchow Soup was warm and comforting, with a nice crunch from the fried noodles. The pulao varieties were fresh and aromatic, and the Mixed Tandoori Platter was a real treat‚Äîperfectly grilled, juicy, and full of flavor. The dessert was too sweet.üòã

The ambience was cozy and welcoming, and the staff was friendly and attentive, making sure we had everything we needed. The portion sizes were generous, and the prices were reasonable. Definitely a great spot for a hearty meal! Highly recommend!"
3,"Thee atmosphere was ohk. The light was dim. AC was not working at all. Inspite of telling, there was no cooling no ventilation. Food was good. Especially, the quantity was too much. But, somewhere I feel, the food could have been tasty. Tandoori chicken was little raw. Veg starter was good. Butter garlic naan was too too thick."
4,"A nice family restaurant exactly opposite Don Bosco high school, with a good ambience and tasty food. They do have a good variety of foods and cuisine to choose from. And the food is really good quality. The place is really nice and cozy. They have nice arrangements for small family gatherings and staff too is very kind and helpful! The only thing that was not great was the caramel custard! But the starters and the main course was amazing!"
5,"Visited Rasna Punjab for a family dinner. It was a very peaceful and neat place with amazing ambience. The staff welcomed us very warmly and suggested us some amazing starters and items from the main course. We tried the chicken wantons, chicken platter, some refreshments, the American Choupsey etc. Everything was well beyond the expectation. And most important to say although this is a bar and restaurant, it's a very decent place to come with family."
2,We recently visited rasna Punjab for dinner. The food was average. For starters we ordered chicken lollipop which was very delicious for main course we ordered butter kulcha( and it was half burnt so it tasted bitter) and chicken pahadi masala ( taste was average). The service was very slow. Starters took almost 1/2 hr followed by main course which again took lot of time. When a person seated on the table besides us asked reason behind the delay the staff was very rude and replied arrogantly. Personally not recommended. Overall experience was unpleasant. Also found it a bit expensive.
1,Horrible and unhygienic place. Received my biryani with a cockroach. Disgusting.
5,"The food, service and the staff were excellent! Will definitely use their services again."
5,"Highly recommended. They have sent lunches and dinners for many months and we are very pleased with the food. Delicious, freshly cooked, hygienic. Well packed and highly reliable delivery. Good variety of dishes and they are willing and able to cater for dietary requirements. Thanks a lot."
4,"The cuisines have taste and goodness of home cooked food. Packaging was decent and neat. Quantity of thali is more than enough for one person. But I had once ordered Khichuri-Labra combo and both the items were very watery and khichuri was quite oily. So, consistency can be improved upon."
1,"It is a take away restaurant...DO NOT GO THERE..The website is very lucrative..It shows many items. I went there and found that it is a very small, dirty, unprofessional kitchen in dirty neighborhood. They did not have even menu. The cooks are not Bengali, so don't expect any quality food. I felt cheated. There is no place to sit. Do not order any food from it."
1,"In my past 3 experiences, the quality of the cake and pastries has got worse. The cake and pasties are not fresh and if complain about the same to the monginis staff they starting blaming me and the behaviour of the staff is worst. I will never visit the shop. monginis you must improve the quality and instruct the staff for good behaviour"
1,"The female working here is so arrogant and lazy that looking at her face no customers will like to visit this spot.

It will be better to keep someone with a welcoming face and an energetic soul to work in the shop.

I went here to buy a cake but returned with sheer disappointment."
5,"This little monginis outlet is excellent with their customer service. Prompt service, easy delivery options, quick payment and refund options. The owner and staff are all very courteous and always willing to go an extra mile to put a smile on your face.  Thanks Rakesh. Look forward to ordering lots of egg black forest pastries üòä"
1,"Pineapple pastry was old and was pathetic in taste.

When tried to call to the shop , the staff was rude and was not listening to what I was saying .Did not expect such behaviour. The owner of the shop is also unmannered .He always talks rudely . When I tried to complain about the pastry , he kept shouting.Pathetic behaviour."
1,"It was worst tastes I never taste before like this..
i said i want in icecream  chocolate... something name was there I don't remember very well  ....
but i buy on 25 January at afternoon...
they said me this is fresh stock ..but later I cut the cake in the evening.....
i taken first bite of cake seriously taste was stale means bread was unfresh..i can say that 2-3 days old cake was there."
1,This place is having too much trouble and don't even know about how to treat people when you ask them about order they keep saying Time lagta hai wait kro this is happening all the time and it's not acceptable very bad experience I ever don't want to visit this place and asking people too dont visit here really bad experience and please suggest your everyone's that they will also avoid this place I was being surprised that they are like this I am very frustrated and this is just not acceptable so I wish I do not visit here again any more
5,"I was in sion for 2 years. This place was a gem for me. I was a regular here. I used to love dal tadka, lollypop dry masala, anda bhurji. I really miss this place. Whenever I visit mumbai, I go to this place."
5,Best place to eat here.. food is realy tasty and amazing
3,Typical South indian lunch home with added indian Chinese menu. Fish thali is good here.
4,"I've tried - full fried rice and full chicken lollypop
To say the rice taste was good but not satisfied with quantity .
Secondly I've tried butter naan and chicken masla . All over chicken masla and butter naan tasted fabulous , delicious ."
5,"Hardeep Punjab - A Treat for Tandoori Lovers!
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Visited Hardeep Punjab recently and was truly impressed by the flavors and the variety! We ordered the Non-Veg Platter, and it was a feast of smoky, juicy, and perfectly marinated delights. The platter included creamy chicken tikka, spicy seekh kebabs, prawns, and fish, each one cooked to perfection. The chutneys and pickled onions served alongside added that extra punch.

The menu offers a wide range of non-veg appetizers ‚Äì from Chaska Maska Tikka to Thai Tikka ‚Äì and everything sounded tempting. The place has a nostalgic charm with its classic Punjabi touch, established since 1988, and it's clear why it‚Äôs a favorite in the area.

Service was quick, portions were generous, and the taste was genuinely authentic. Whether you're with friends or family, this is a solid place to enjoy rich Punjabi flavors.

Must-try: Non-Veg Platter, Prawns Lasooni Tikka, and Chicken Lollipop
Will definitely be back to explore more from the menu!"
5,"Went to Hardeep Punjab for a family dinner, we had their Chicken Manchow Soup, masala chicken lollipop, Chicken tikka biryani (no matka) and Dal fry & jeera rice.

They also served us with variety of side dishes (peanuts, chakli, fried noodles) for timepass and onion, pickles, etc.

The food portion was good, food was tasty and would definitely go again.

Do try their matka biryani options for an experience.

Post dinner, they served sauf, sweet imli candies and jaggery instead of sugar which was the plus point.

Also, make sure you avoid sitting next to the washroom."
5,"Kudos to the staff at hardeep punjab for their hospitality, warm welcome, ever smiling faces and earnest approach towards providing the best of hospitality and maintenance to the guests. Special mention of Captain Shyam who precisely and meticulously guided us through the menu and made efforts to ensure that each of the recipes reccomended to us provided a curated experience and matched our taste buds. As we were 5 of us , 3 vegetarians and 2 non vegetarians, we ordered a veg tandoori platter and a non veg tandoori platter. Such an array of mesmerising options, the stuffed mushrooms were a clear winner and in the non veg fare the cheese garlic chicken tikkas won a double whammy. Flavour of the season was sarson da saag makke ki roti platter. We were greeted with multiple munchin options like chaklis peanuts salad chutneys and their customised punjabi pickle which we also bought it from their sale shelf during our exit. The makhmali kofta curry , missi roti , latcha paratha were perfectly cooked, unlike other restuarants who offer a rubbery chewy  stretchable maida.
The punjabi pakodi kadi chawal added finishing touches to the culinary experience. A brownie point for the tamarind candies and the mouth refreshners served alongside jaggery for the sweet aromatic blissful event. Service food quality quantity truly a 10 on 10 . Must visit place"
4,"Place is not that lavish, but the food is to die for. If you like punjabi cuisine, this is a 'do not miss to eat here' place"
5,"We ordered butter garlic prawns (fresh, juicy, tiger prawns cooked to perfection) üòã, mutton kheema, butter chicken, chicken chatpata and ravas amritsari. Each and every item was well prepared, could taste butter and both quality and quantity was very good. Mr.Jas at the parcel counter was very kind and supportive. Though we were standing for takeaway, we were treated with courtousy and offered place to sit with water and gud. My family enjoyed the meal. Coming again for sure."
5,"All our guests in my wedding were raving about the food taste, quality and quantity. Highly recommended and One of the best caterer in Mumbai at very reasonable rates."
1,i told u the real thing about this caters.he is using bad water for cooking food. He is using the ice which is not made by hygenic water.and he is using same starter for next party he used for last party if it is reamaning plus food also if it is reamaning like dal and  rice.  losts of thing u r not aware about.so plz consider before booking the arora caters .if u ok with the above issue and u r not concern about youself and ur guest health so u can go head.
5,Its been a goid experience by giving this catering service my order... It was beyond expectation loved it....
5,Amazing food and service
5,Awesome n delicious
1,Staff was not interested in bulk order enquiry. He was so disinterested and acted as if he was doing a favour. Will never walk in any Monginis shop ever and will not recommend anyone.
1,"Very poor quality ....
Only icing was good... inside sponge was very soggy and sticky... worst quality....üëéüëéüëéüëéüëé"
1,Worst cake shop  I have ever seen in my life ..spoiled my bday... Ordered a hammers cake of rs 1200 ... But the taste was very bad... Earlier I bought a sponge cake from that shop... It's taste was also very bad... I don't know why this shop is running.... It should be closed....you can see the condition of cake below...
3,"Convinient place for buying cakes and party stuff. Customer service can be improved in terms of communication. Cake quality is fine but better than other cake shop in the nearby locality.
The chocolate muffins & devil delight are my favorite out of all cakes. There is an option of doll cake but they don't take order for less than 3kg cake. There ain't any home delivery option available here."
4,Most of the time bought cakes from this shop. Always happy with their eateries. Never disappointed. If you can pay little more than other shop's price then you should try purchasing here.
3,"Also known as :- lunch box

Taste is decent but hygiene and handling of the food is excellent. They provide you various options to eat from jain food to non veg. From desi food to fast food.
Chole kulchya tastes best here i always used to eat that here.
They also offer home delivery and there are various coupons and offers every day. But if you order without any offer it is truly very very costly as compared to quantity.
Although the quality of food is grt and mind blowing.
They offer home delivery via
swiggy
Zomato
uber eats
And also they have their own delivery executives .
The packing and handling of the food during delivery is very good. But they charge you high rates known as packing charges. But the delivery is free."
1,"Order for fasoos combo but never received a combo order was incompletely send cold drinks were missing after informing the restaurant they answered that we will refund your 30 rs for 2 combos this is the biggest joke no apology from the team
No information passed by restaurant that they didn't have cold drink I would have cancelled the order there tone was like 30 rs lene he to lo nhi thi bhad me jao
We send only fries and roll for 300 bucks which I get in 50 rs on the road side
The taste was like some helper chef has made the food so much oil and food was raw such as roomali
I will not surprised when restaurant will send only chips and cold drink and they will call as combo then they will say take 30 rs Or bhad me jao"
4,"So recently ordered a wrap from Fassos packing was good

I have ordered Reshmi chicken kebab wrap:- This wrap was soo good in taste serves 1 only not soo loaded one taste and quality was good quantity can improve some more as per price
Overall good experience"
4,"Known as 'Lunchbox' in Swiggy
Online Order: Smoked butter chicken & chicken Tikka jumbo lunchbox
Delivery: OnTime
Packaging: Excellent 5/5
Quantity: Nothing like jumbo 3/5
Taste : Great in Taste 5/5
Value for money: With discount provided by Swiggy it's worth 5/5."
1,"Ordered from there official app. Never going to order it from any outlet. Found ant in basundi. For proof see the attached pic. Worst part is that, there is no way to complain on app."
4,"I recommend going to there it's nice it's always empty some it is busy but they deliver the food always on time. Some time they just don't have change I have gone there one time at 11:00Am but the store manager tell me the store will open at 11:30 Am but he sayed  we can come in and order till then he will do the preparation to open. The store is still in construction that's why some time it is vary dirty but most of the time it's is clean . I only eat the classic because it is vary cheap ‚Çπ51(with tax)
I have never tried the non-veg pizza
But all the time I have eaten the classic pizza it has one vary important thing that I like is that the pizza chess is like fully baked but still a liquid like texture .
The staff are vary nice also . I just hope that they have change the next time I visit because I don't like when I have to wait for them to go to other shop and get change then give it to me. It just wasting time other than this I am vary happy with everything alse you can see the zoom up pic it shows how liquid is the chess .
Not like that pizza that I eat at vages mall in Delhi Dwarka sec 12 they don't even know how to properly cut the pizza the slices were unequal and the waiting time was vary long ."
1,The worst Franchisee center . Atmosphere is hygienic and no cleanness at all. The online order is also get delayed for 2 min. distance's destination.
1,"Worst experience ever üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°

I recently visited Domino's and was left disappointed with the service. When I arrived, there was no staff at the counter, which already set a bad tone. To make matters worse, I was told that they were out of pizza, which is their main product! However, the staff then informed me that they did have pizzas available, which was confusing and frustrating‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Main thing is that they have but they don‚Äôt want give us."
3,Nog good food also service not good and atmosphere wo to rahne hi do üíî
4,"Minimum price of 59+GST. Good for sole, two and party going. Staffs are coordinating. Just the place is not well maintained up to the mark and some plumbing issues are there in the washroom."
1,After drunk went to pay the bill they thought I was not in conscious mind and when I gave them my credit card they swiped it 2 times. This is what happens there so be careful..
5,"5 star rating is for awesome food available at affordable rates, staff is also very good and friendly. It is a regular spot for me and my friend, we visit her every once in a week since 3 months."
5,It's a really good place for having drinks and food at low and reasonable price...the food is really tasty and the staff is really supporting. Good place for a quick drink.
1,They served boondi raita it was bakwas they don‚Äôt know how to cook service is very goog
5,"It is good place to drink a beer with chakana.
Best thing about this bar is people are so good and eateries items will never disappoint you.

Best to celebrate with friends in weekends."
4,"Amazing food and quick service, new variety of dishes in all sort of food verticals. Only thing is mahor disadvantage that is it‚Äôs too small place and if you have big group of 10-12 people, you need to have wait for 40-50mins"
4,Have dinner in the month of October 2018. Taste are awesome especially paneer guldasta and moti mahal. Great thing is that it is pure vegetarian. Love to visit again in future.
4,Not that popular restaurant in Ghatkopar. But it's good and worth.
3,"Ambience and location is alright. Service is fine too. But there's nothing great about the food. This place doesn't get over crowded even on weekends, like every other place in Ghatkopar East. So go here if you want a peaceful dine out on weekends without long waiting times and crowds, but not much else."
5,An awesome place from the hustle of the ordinary restaurant.. A quiet place and great ambience. Need to spend quality time with your friends or a family get together then this place is simply wonderful. Also all the food bloggers out there can have some wonderful pictures. Located in the heart of Ghatkopar this is a perfect place for all the vegans and vegetarians.
4,"The shop has good variety of food and other snacks. I'm a regular customer of the outlet. Me and my family visit the outlet quite often and our favourite is ""Falooda""
I highly recommend ""Chocolate falooda""
Try atleast once."
5,"Good variety of sandwiches and juices. Try their combination juices, They are simply delicious."
3,"The shop has good variety of sandwiches & milk shakes. Me and my friends visit this joint very often . Service is fast & prices are pocket friendly. My personal favourite is samosa cheese sandwich, veg grilled sandwich and mango shake."
5,"Fresh juice with a smile in search..?????
Then your search ends here.
I always ask for seasonal fresh and with no sugar... Sunil always ends up giving me the best the season has to offer.
With new paper cup sealing.. Take home is also an easy task...
Would recommend this place to any one and every one"
5,I love their sandwiches. Especially the samosa cheese toast sandwich. They also provide home delivery in nearby areas. Rates are reasonable as well.
3,"Udipi is a decent spot for South Indian cuisine. The dosa was quite good, but the wada could use a bit more crunchiness to elevate the texture. Overall, the dining experience was satisfactory, although there is room for improvement. If you're craving authentic South Indian flavors, this restaurant is worth a visit, but don't expect perfection."
5,The authentic South Indian flavors are simply divine. From the fluffy idlis to the crispy dosas. A must-visit for anyone craving delicious vegetarian food.
5,"This place has been around forever. Now run by two brothers the place serves probably some of the best dosas in town.

The food quality is always consistent. The onion rava sada and sada dosas are to die for.

The ac section is generally closed. The seating is comfortable though.

Expect amazing food, great service in a non pretentious ambience."
5,"If you wish to eat South Indian food this is the best hotel. Good vibes, taste and affordable prices."
1,"Extremely rude owner just asked for an ice cream but we didn't have cash and gpay was allowed just above 250 rs which is fine, but the way he asked us to leave the place as if we were beggers trying to get things for free, it was extremely rude and mean such people should not run a shop who don't even have manners and don't know how to treat their costomers"
5,"Had an amazing experience at Pure Milk & Snacks Centre in Ghatkopar! The place serves some really unique and flavorful vegetarian dishes. We tried the Mango Mastani, which was super refreshing and rich, and the Blue Curaccio Mocktail added a perfect cool twist to the meal. The Paneer Sticks Sizzler was sizzling hot and full of flavor, while the Cheese Balls Cheese Fondue Dosa totally stole the show with its fusion of South Indian and cheesy goodness.

The ambiance is clean and family-friendly, and the service was prompt and courteous. If you‚Äôre a fan of cheesy dishes, fusion snacks, or mocktails, this spot is a hidden gem you shouldn‚Äôt miss. A perfect place for casual outings with friends or family. Definitely coming back to try more from their menu!"
4,"Cheeseburst lovers can go to this place I found it a little prizy but the taste, serving, atmosphere, everything is all good in case your going to eat dosa please look after the quantity because they only provide 2 pieces with price of 300 to 400 rupees and I will surely recommend their Peri Peri pasta go and try."
5,They have all varieties of fast foods and their food is quite cheesy if you are looking to try something new then you should definitely visit this place
5,Ordered falooda gadbad icecream and pasta pav bhaji cheese dosa. Both were yum but a bit pricy. The location is not correctly tagged on Maps. It's ~200m away from the location.
1,"This place has downgraded a lot, food is not that great anymore. 4/5 years ago this was the best place to go to. Now I'd rather not eat than eat here. The Garlic bread is tasteless just too much bread and no balance in the flavour of garlic or cheese. The cheese burst dosa which is their signature is so downgraded gosh don't even try it. I'd say don't go there, go somewhere else if you like to have tasteful and soulful food. Although lastly I had cold coffee which was fairly good enough for the price and low benchmark that the food had placed."
5,Jain food was awesome. The staff was super quick. Fantastic hospitality.
4,"Nice place for vegetarians, they have good and unique options in staters.

We had
- Cheese chilli toast
- Some potato stuffed dish : must try
- Lasuni paneer with kulcha and chapati : very good
- Chinese pot rice : spicy lover can try"
1,Very poor service and food quality. Visited with family and ordered paneer tikka masala. A human hair was found in it. Photo being uploaded with review. We brought it to the notice of waiter and he just replaced it without any apology. We also brought it to the notice of Manager but he was very careless saying kya huwa. It can be very harmful to our health. Don't visit.
2,"Extremely poor hygiene which is out there to see for everyone visiting the hotel . The pictures do not depict the taste , presentation or ambience of the place. Just the way in which the food is stored for future consumption seems a total put off . Request the owners to kindly clean it up"
1,Burmese Khow Suey ordered and served after approx. 25 minutes. But I can challenge to complete within 02 minutes because it was so cold. Atleast they should have cooked and bolied properly before serving. I didn't order anything further and left the site.
2,"Pizzas are good. They have limited seating area. I ordered from dominos app for take-away. On my way to the pickup location got a call from them saying that order is confirmed and I said that I‚Äôm reaching in 5mins. After reaching they asked to for additional 10mins which was fine, but after 10mins when I saw the app my orders status was updated to - Preparation complete and pickup pending. Eventually got the order but in my sense service can be improved a lot."
1,"Order through Zomato, worst product provided.

Didn‚Äôt even provided any herbs.

Filling were too less.

Need to work on the quality of products."
1,"Horrible experience , selected a takeaway through app , I got the order very late , plus on enquiring about my order the lady at the counter asked me to show order history, she took my phone and went inside and gave ratings on her own , without my permission. I have raised a complaint on the website and they haven't even bothered to call back.
Pizzas were ok , the place was dirty to sit and eat, used boxes were just kept and no one bothered to pick them fr long time."
4,"Pizza was well-made, staff is cooperative.
Good for take away, it doesn't have enough space to dine in, especially on the weekends."
3,"Not enough place to sit.They were out of Nonveg menu when we placed the order.
We had gone there for Nonveg pizzas but ended up eating Veg ones as we were hungry.
Overall- Good"
4,Waffle quality is very good. They have chairs/benches as their sitting area. There are few waffle options. Service is nice. They have offers during festive seasons.
4,I like the waffles. But only drawback of this place is it doesn‚Äôt have an indoor seating place.
5,"This little dessert shop specializes in Waffles.. Upon entering the shop there was delightful aroma of waffles..

We tried ‚ÄúChocolate Overload Waffle‚Äù and ‚ÄúCrushed Oreo Waffle with Icecream‚Äù.. Perfectly cooked with a crispy exterior and a soft interior. It‚Äôs a must visit for anyone with a sweet tooth. üòÉ"
5,"This outlet is located in the busy streets of ghatkopar. They have some awesome waffles here. I just love their waffles. Seating space is not that big and it is usually crowded.
FOOD:-
1)Cotton candy (MUST TRY)
2) Chocolate overload
3) Triple chocolate"
5,"Super delicious Belgian waffle . They serve food with 0 percent maida so they are very health conscious . They have waffle wich and pancake of different categories of chocolate, double chocolate, classics and brownie.
Also they charge extra 30 rupees for icecream scoop. On waff-wich"
4,"Achija Veg Restaurant, Ghatkopar East ‚Äì A Vegetarian Haven in the Heart of Mumbai

Achija is a well-known name among vegetarians in Mumbai, and the Ghatkopar East outlet lives up to the reputation. With a wide-ranging menu that spans Indian, Chinese, and fast food classics, this place caters to every craving under one roof.

The pav bhaji‚Äîespecially the Masala and Khada variants‚Äîsteal the show. Perfectly spiced, buttery, and served piping hot, it‚Äôs no surprise this dish has a fan following of its own. The dosas are crisp and generously filled, while the Chinese offerings like Manchurian and Hakka noodles are satisfying and flavorful.

The restaurant is clean, brightly lit, and always buzzing with activity. It‚Äôs a family-friendly space, though peak hours can get a bit crowded. Service is generally efficient, though there can be slight delays when it‚Äôs packed.

Prices are reasonable for the portions and quality served. Whether you're stopping by for a full meal or a quick snack, Achija rarely disappoints."
4,"A decent, air-conditioned, sit-down restaurant located in the heart of Ghatkopar Khau Galli with a fully vegetarian menu. Despite the hype, the experience was underwhelming. The Pav Bhaji was good, but nothing extraordinary‚Äîsimilar to what you'd find elsewhere.

The restaurant is well-ventilated and brightly lit, offering a comfortable dining space, but it tends to get quite crowded. Parking is a major drawback, as none is available nearby."
2,"Achija, once famous for its pav bhaji, isn‚Äôt living up to its name anymore. Had the worst pav bhaji‚Äîtoo much butter, lacking flavor, and greasy pav. Surprisingly, their pizza is still better. Prices are higher for outdoor seating, and there are much better options elsewhere.
Wouldn‚Äôt recommend"
2,"Visited Achija Ghatkopar East after trying their other outlets, but this one was a real letdown. Ordered the Tawa Pulao, rice was undercooked, bland, and completely lacked flavor. For ‚Çπ275, I expected much better. I had planned to order more, but this dish totally killed the mood. Disappointed, especially considering the reputation of their other branches."
5,One of the best places to have Pav Bhaji. Also tried their Garlic bread. Soft and just delicious.
4,"Great place to enjoy some nice booze. Their rates are very reasonable and the staff is very kind. They have amazing offers on drinks every time so make sure you avail them. Also, they have a dish named Paneer Charminar which was really delicious so make sure you give it a try!"
3,"The best part is you get 7 types of chakna as complimentary and unlimited which includes peanuts, chana, chakli, salad(kakdi, gajar), vati, bhel and their special menu for the day. When I went I got moong bhaji so in total 7 different chakna's unlimited.
The price of liquor will be more as compared to your local bars and their items on the menu are also costly.
Also, this is a VEG BAR so no chicken, mutton or fish only pure Veg."
3,I don't think it was cheap for alcohol but yeah it was fully crowded (Men crowded) . Pure veg üòÖ some of Chakna are free rest is okok types regular resto bar type. And yeah Ventilation was not there.
4,Enjoyed time with friends and had fun
5,"Best restaurant and bar in ghatkopar east .. many restaurants on the same road. I really liked the name and entered to the first floor. They have a very huge projector for sports screening. It's a only veg bar and they give multiple chaknas .. liked the ambience, had a good time."
2,"I tried Hazelnut cold coffee.
Very rude staff, no AC was switched on, no one was there to attend and take order
Had to wait for long, waiter was busy on mobile phone, scrolling reels even when he saw me sitting

I didn‚Äôt have 1 rupee change so asked me to pay online
So I told to remove the service charge which they forced me to pay
I have attached the bill"
5,"One of the best places to have hot chocolate üòç
The place is very cute, has a cozy ambiance and the vibes are amazing. And don't go by the name. Apart from desserts like shakes, sundaes, waffles, they also serve pizzas, pastas, sizzlers, fondues, sandwiches and much more ‚ù§Ô∏è
Mexican Fondue was my favourite of all. Very creamy, cheesy and flavorful sauce served with bread, fries, veggies and nachos .
The hot chocolate was out of this world. Do visit and try yourself üï∫üèª"

3,This place is a heaven for people with a sweet tooth! Firstly they have a cool ambience with their choice of decor. I took my younger cousins here and they went crazy on their yummy & wide range of chocolate options. All their shakes are really great and top notch. The lil ones are eager to go back. The staff was polite and service was good. PS: I noticed they have some books & board games only when we were leaving
5,"Visited chocolate room, This place in ghatkopar just 2kms away from ghatkopar station.
You will find here a elegant and pleasant environment. Yes, the name itself says it has varities of chocolates but here you will get italian cuisine, indian starters as well.
I had ordered, jalapeno cheese balls, arberita sizzlers, chocoBomb and chocolate fondue. All of these were amazing in taste. Chocolate fondue was served with marshmallows, brownie cake, chocolate stick and cookies, which were amazing in taste.
I would recommend people to visit this restaurant.
Overall, an amazing experience."
4,"Apsara Icecreams is a very popular chain service & serves the best icecreams in the city.
The concept of making icecream is very traditional and the taste of each flavour is very unique.
You should try icecream made up fresh fruits like Mango,Strawberry,Berry etc.
The ambience of the place is subtle and comfy.
I would suggest to try the icecream flavour before placing any order as all the flavour are a bit different."
4,"Icecream is best üòãüòãüòã can't help to have 2nd one but the service and staffs are under experience to even take order or how to make payments via app and also they have card machine for zero.
Also unaware of the offers running go zero ice creams had 50% off but they charged full because of the procedure to order."
5,"Follow me for more on Instagram @alimentary_empire
I was actually waiting to visit this place for so long!
Such an awesome range of natural fruit flavored ice creams. You will be amazed by the taste. One must try the guava with chili powder and salt. They also have a  wide range of sugar free ice creams in their range. Awesome must try.Amazing range of flavours being served here making the overall Experience delightful for ice cream lovers.

5,Please please please try the Guava ice cream which is served with local masala. It reminds you off that person who use to come to our street and serve guava cut in half with masala placed on top of it. Amazing!!! 5 on 5.
2,"The ambiance of this restaurant is amazing. It's unique, youthful and full of colours. The place has nice comfortable seating and swings too if you're fed-up of the normal seating.

The menu has a lot of variety in various categories.

The taste of the food is where the experience dips as that's the area which needs utmost attention at the moment. The food looked great and full points on presentation but it didn't taste great. The food was pale and was below average.

The quantity and pricing is fine.

The service is a bit slow but the staff is quite welcoming.

The place is good for hanging out with friends and others, it's a chilled out place but not a place I'd like to visit for it's food."
5,"Quirky superb place to visit specially for the food. They have amazing quality, quantity and taste of food. Their Signature dish of Spinach rice with Basilica sauce is a must must try. I am sure no one can be disappointed with that. The ambience is good and nice seating arrangement. There are tables with swinging chairs as well. The menu is quite interesting and so is its taste. The taste of all the variety of food is something really really worth trying. The chef is an amazing one here. Cheese Pav bhaji fondue, hummus with pita bread are another level dishes with make one crave for it."
4,We first ordered Peri Peri French Fries which were Crispy and Tasty AF‚ù§Ô∏è.Then we went on to Paneer Sizzler which was well presented. Quantity was also good and taste was awesome ü§§üíû. Then we had Oreo Shake which aur tremendously good‚ù§Ô∏èüíØ Paisa wasool KhanaüíØ‚ù§Ô∏è
3,"This place is near somaiya college , the ambience and seating arrangement is very nice . Music was a little too slow and boring . The service is fast here.
We tried many things here but nothing was too great . Also the prices are very high for the quality .
You can try kitkat milkshake , paneer tikka pizza , fondue here. The mocktails and pasta were okay.
Overall only a good place for one time visit .

Outside and inside both seating available.

Not many options for food
Pizza rates are skyhigh
Mosquito problem over there...
Fancy decorum
Food dishes and presentation up to the mark
Quick service
Overall good experience"
1,No attention on customer. And cleaniness is a matter thats why i am giving 2 star. Taste of a margrita is below the average
1,"Staff is very very arrogant and senseless, was entering the store today and they were loading some stock, the staff there was behind me and just randomly screaming without saying anything politely as madam excuse me or get aside how would I know someone from back is screaming over me the staff didn't had that sense to be polite none of the staff came to ask what happened or confront very very bad service worst experience ever.
Staff is not bothered at all reven if you are waiting for so long to just order
I recieved wrong orders 2 times I ordered 4 cheese pizza and both times there was no cheese I have had 4 cheese pizza more regularly but 2 times I got it without cheese"
1,"Cold pizza received and less cheese, and garlic bread was under cooked, chicken wings ordered they sent me meat balls.. ordered received in 1 hour...they didn't called and informed about order changed."
1,"the staff here is very rude and the atmosphere is depressing i would not recommend anyone to visit here.
the staffs are mannerless people and the stores atmosphere is horrible. the cleanliness of the store feels like we are visiting a trash bin
ill give this dominoes a 0 on 10.
wont recommend anyone to order from this store even for delivery
dominoes in odeon is way better"
1,It's not about this store particularly but Dominos in general. Why do you want to do a cash only take out order if you won't start it until the customer comes and pays. Don't keep the option if you fear customer might misuse. Waste of time ordering in advance and then you have to wait for them to make the pizza...
5,"Ordered this cake for a family celebration and was so impressed with the taste. Soft sponge without being watery, perfect cream and the name was also written very nicely.
Service was good, and the shop was nice and clean with the AC on.
Will definitely visit again and buy from them."
5,"They have the best cakes at very affordable price. Tried their new Kunafa pastry, viral dubai Chocolate and Chocolate croissant, 10/10 for all."
5,Best cake shop in Ghatkopar east. Highly recommended to everyone.
5,Shop is kept clean and tidy staff is very good and polite. They serve fresh cakes plz do visit this shop.
1,"The chocolate pastry was dry, spongy, and lacked a strong chocolate flavor. It didn't taste fresh, and the chocolate lava cake had filling an egg-like taste. Big disappointing.
Ribbons and Ballons taste better than this."
3,"atmosphere worst in every location ... üòÅüòÅ

Food wise ok ..ok .. except premium pizza's

besic pizzas are like bread and tomato katchup .. some cheeze .. no taste at all .."
1,"Worst in my life
I think worst in india
Never visit this location"
1,i tried to call this restaurant 100 times. never pick up the call. so dissapointed. definately never gonna try dominos again
1,Very unhygienic‚Ä¶Need to maintain the place as it is such a big brand and we cant expect such kind of surrounding from Domino‚Äôs‚Ä¶ It should be atleast pestcontrolled.
5,üòáüòãSo yummy.....üçïüå≠üçîüçùüç±üòâ
1,"Extremely disappointed with the customer service at Jumbo King. I visited the Ghatkopar outlet recently, and the staff were shockingly rude and unbothered. No greeting, no smile‚Äîjust attitude. I asked a simple question about the menu, and the guy named Vinod (may be store manager) at the counter rolled his eyes like I was wasting his time. After placing my order, I had to wait way longer than expected, and when I politely asked about the delay, I was met with more attitude instead of any explanation. Honestly, it felt like they just didn‚Äôt care. The food wasn‚Äôt even fresh enough to make up for it. With so many burger options out there, bad service like this is a deal-breaker. Never going back."
5,"JK Outlet at Ghatkopar Metro station. I had a quick grab of Nachos Burger. Good taste also they have daily discount offer on an item that makes it lucrative. No seating, stand and eat. Good vegetarian option for a quick bite on the go."
1,"Brooo ,  jumbo-king has depleted their quality and price ..like  even MCD offers are better than them they even offer place to sit and eat .But the marketing and strategy jumbo-king has been using is just making me not to buy from them anymore you wont  accept 1 penny less if we are short on money then how come your outlet doesn‚Äôt have any change ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.also the pricing has been the worst costing 80 for a burger ‚Ä¶it was supposed to be pocket friendly for college kids how come can we afford this range as affordable ‚Ä¶.need to change your game jumbo-king i ain‚Äôt buying from u anymoree‚Ä¶.."
1,"Very poor quality service, we ordered potato fries and they served us very cheap quality as you can see in the image"
2,"Customer Service guy by the name Harilal Sharma is very RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL and ARGUMENTATIVE. He is oversmart(he should always remember that the customer is 'King' and we are more smarter than him) and also he does not have basic etiquettes, basically has NO MANNERS NO DECENCY while talking to and serving customers.I am a regular customer and the LEAST WHICH IS EXPECTED IS BEING NICE AND POLITE.Absolutely Unhappy!!!"
5,"I've been to this shop just once. It is a big shop. And a good shop as well. And I had the devil delight pastry which was quite good and tasty. When u reheat it, it even tastes more tastier. And the paneer puff was just quite good and tasty."
5,Good ambience pocket friendly nice service by staff wide variety of cakes and buns are available pizza base and burger buns are also available seatings available very fresh and tasty cakes and pastries birthday cakes are available
5,The cake quality is good..the owner and staff are friendly and the response is quick....the ambience is good and would recommend others to visit the store.
5,Very delicious cake.
4,Best cake shop for birthday parties
5,"Absolutely Delightful Experience at NEO WELCOME!

We had an amazing time dining at NEO WELCOME. We tried the Mysore Masala Cheese Dosa, and it was simply wow ‚Äî crispy, flavorful, and cheesy in the best way possible. The Schezwan Fried Rice was tasty and generous in portion, perfect for sharing.

We also tried their Cold Coffee, which was slightly on the sweeter side but still refreshing and enjoyable. The Paneer Paratha and Sada Butter Cheese Dosa were equally satisfying and lived up to the expectations.

What really stood out, apart from the great food, was the excellent service. The staff were very attentive ‚Äî one of the waiters was constantly going around refilling cold water glasses the moment they were empty. Such thoughtful service is rare and truly appreciated.

Located just outside the station, it‚Äôs super convenient to get to. Overall, a fantastic veg restaurant with great food, top-notch service, and a welcoming vibe. Highly recommended and a must-visit!"
4,"A good place for a quick no fuss meal. They have a lot of good south indian food but they also have north indian as well as Chinese cuisine. We had the potato toast and it was good though a little bit on the bland side. But the green chutney served together with it recompensed for it by adding that bit of chilli ness!! The coffee was good.
Location  being near Ghatkopar station it is mostly very crowded most of the time."
4,"Idli sambar, medu wada sambar is a must to have!
Ambience is old styled and airy but lacks air conditioning. Waiters are also old styled and not much enthusiastic serving their customers though they attend clients promptly. One big turn off is they donot accept credit cards!!!! Cash/ UPI is only accepted. UPI Payments through Rupay credit card is also not accepted."
5,The BEST Sambar in Mumbai. Strongly recommend the sambar alongside batata vada / idli / dosa
4,"Old is gold...When many restaurants have come up with modernity, old typical restaurants are losing their existence but food at such restaurant is reasonable and tasty.
So was very close to Ghatkopar station and was very hungry.I found this restaurant and was reluctant to go...wahi purana sa restaurant laga but as I had to catch a local train too so just moved into this typical older style restaurant...omg their food is sooooo good ..from south Indian breakfast to Indian meals and everything that you would feel like having can be found here.
No Ac though but its quite reasonable and easy on pocket.
Misal on the next table looked temptingüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ so me too ordered the same and this I can say super tastiest misal pav I tried beyond my expectation.

Pet bhar jayega lekin mann nahi  bharega sort of .They do such wonderful work of serving you super fast.wahi purana style of plates and waiter coming with gamcha( small towel) on his shoulder..Thats the olden days charm.
Very close to Ghatkopar West Railway station."
1,"Ordered Punjabi Deluxe Jain Thali from here. Food wasn't good at all. I had ordered jain thali and one of the red colored curry looked like non veg curry. I couldn't even dare to eat it. Dal wasn't nice in taste, Paneer was yuck. Even gulab jamun was not good."
5,It is located at the back side of road in front of ICICI Bank. Quality and food taste was fantastic. Quantity is also great. No need to buy mineral water bottle. Regular water is good enough.
4,"If you're a true Pav Bhaji lover, this place is an absolute gem! The bhaji is rich, buttery, and packed with flavor, perfectly complemented by soft, toasted pav. Hygiene, quick service, and a satisfying portion make it a go-to spot every time. Definitely one of the best Pav Bhaji experiences around a must-try!"
1,Restaurant was good before ..It has gotten ridiculously as worst as it can be.. I'm afraid of getting food poison after eating such rotten smelly vegetables
5,Service wise Super and taste is Mouthwatering üòã Entering Gopal gally Smell is mouth watering Shiv Krupa never Disappointed with there taste and Service Superb üëå
3,Mostly men only bar. Not a place one can bring family. Gets very crowded and noisy in the evening. Service is fast and prices are reasonable. They do give complimentary biting with drinks. Also have a separate AC section. Located close to Ghatkopar station. Okay place to get together with friends for a quick drink and food.
5,Good place for friends. Im visiting this restaurant since 2017 and I don‚Äôt prefer girls to visit as the men majority is more.
2,"This place is overcrowded with poor service. The drinks offered here seem to be duplicate content. Also, the food taste and quality is not up to the mark."
1,"I had high expectations for this restaurant, but sadly, it was a disappointing experience. The food took over an hour to arrive, and when it did, it was cold and lacked flavor. The staff seemed indifferent and inattentive, as if they were doing us a favor by serving us. To make matters worse, the seating area was cramped, and the overall ambiance was noisy and chaotic. For the steep prices, I expected much better service and quality. Definitely not worth the hype, and I won‚Äôt be returning anytime soon."
5,"It has total 3 areas where you sit and enjoy your drinks.

1. Non AC area

Further AC is divided into two parts smoking and non smoking. For me this is best as I don‚Äôt smoke and I hate the smoke.

Apart from this, the music there is quite low so one can chill in peace.

Ambience is great.

Service is amazing. You can have unlimited snacks (Limited Options)while you are drinking.

Obviously rates vary in AC and NON Ac.

This place serves both veg and non veg food.

For veg usually I have Schezwan Fried Rice; Quantity of this dish is good. Easily 2 people can eat.

EAT. DRINK. RELAX. CHILL

NOTE: Rates are affordable"
3,"Average food, with a bit higher rates.. still  Friday's they make khichra.. which I found is good"
5,Good biryani with plenty of gravy brought 1kg and you can also eat or take parcel in small portions i.e per plate system
5,"The best place to get quality food that fits to anyone's budget....
Great taste and services

Visited today in the evening:
We ordered Medu Vada and Masala dosa.
Both were superb in taste and quality. Loved the chutney .
Also ordered tea and sweet lime soda."
4,One of the few South Indian Udupi restaurant in Mumbai. This is located on LBS road Ghatkopar. Old styled but still with the flavour of udupi style. The Dosa varities are good especially the Rava onion Dosabandvwe can see many people are eating the meal combo. Good to Go and Experience!
4,This charming restaurant offers a delightful dining experience.  The menu boasts a variety of flavorful vegetarian dishes.  Fresh ingredients and aromatic spices enhance each bite. The attentive staff creates a welcoming atmosphere.  It's a wonderful place to enjoy a delicious and satisfying meal.
5,"True to its name. Punjabi - Good good, good taste, good quantity. South Indian - Definitely their turf."
3,One of the renowned restaurants in the area. We always prefer Shalimar Over Abhinandan. They may not be as fancy as abhinandan but it's less crowded and food is really good. Almost all the dishes are affordable and taste wise it's 4/5.
5,"It's an awesome restaurant. I must suggest for good and tasty food with reasonable price. It's our favourite restaurant. Here the service is so nice. They are providing quick service. They also suggested there food as per your requirement. Here quantity for any items is more, like 1 plate chicken will be enough for four people."
3,"Butter chicken is tasty. No for Crispy, Chicken Crispy was not at all upto the mark whereas it cost 245/- which is totally waste of money as it taste bad. You can go for mughlai dishes here but not for rice or chinese dishes"
5,"One of the best restaurant for non-vegetarians people's all types of non veg dishes,meals, Rice's are available here with best quality. A dish known‚Äã as murg-mussalam is speciality of this hotel and for vegetarians all types of paneer dishes all good. In the dessert caremal custurd also test Good"
5,"Shalimar is a popular restaurant in Vikhroli west. They offer tasty Non veg dishes at good price. Food sometimes is bit oily but I guess that is how it is made more tasty. You should try Murgmusallam, chicken patiyala, chicken Rashida. It's super tasty. It has dine in option available nowm they used to have AC and Non AC section too. Plus delivery is alo available. It's at walkable distance from R city just next to Abhinandan"
5,The food is good with super quality and taste.. the have good sitting placement and space.. their hospitality is way ahead then many other restaurants.. the service is very good...

5,"Awesome service by staff, ambience and atmosphere at restaurant along with fast service.
Speciality dishes like chickoo halwa, caramel custard and prawns koliwada are the must try at restaurant."
5,I have visited this place twice in last 10 days. Great veg and non veg food. Prices are decent. Service is quick. Waiters know the dishes and can guide you on what to eat if u want recommendations. We tried cocktails which were decent. Limited options but quality is good. They also have valet parking service. All in all a good place to hangout with friends and family.
1,We ordered surmai. Stale and no taste at all. 2 pieces were served. We had only one. At the end we ordered took parcel. They did not parcel our left over surmai. How rediculous is that. Waste of money.No salt food was served. Me and my husband visited as we were only 2 ppl they did not pay more attention to quality and tastes. However if any one ask in office we will never recommend this
1,"Very bad and spoilt ras malai ,, I had ordered 24pieces they delivered in 2containers ,one was proper and other was smelling bad ,it was so embarrassing as guest told me this , never ever order from here"
1,"Terrible experience. If you go in to buy one particular item, the staff will pester you to buy 5 more things. Definitely not the experience you would expect in such a reputed shop. Wouldn't recommend anyone to visit here because of my unpleasant experience today. You feel like you're in a vegetable market where the counter boys keep hounding you to buy more."
5,"Fantastic, good quality and great customer service."
1,"I have been a regular customer for the last 8 years.
I have a serious complaint about Paneer. I buy paneer thrice a week. Even though I am a regular customer many times they don't hesitate to hand over spoiled paneer to my driver who all the time fails to check and I realise it once it reaches home. Rest products are best like Nachni Chips and soya sticks. Beware of Paneer."
4,"A good place to buy salty snacks and indian sweets. For the best of their sweets, ask what's been made fresh that day. It's usually pretty good. Be advised, though, they sometimes misidentify fried items as 'roasted'."
5,"Extremely Good food. Loved the ambience and the service.
To our surprise even though it's a Bar n Resturant the ambience was great. The tables were spacious and comfortable. It's a vegetarian restaurant and has good variety.
We tried their Chilly Guava Mocktail which was really nice. Also the Paneer Cheese Starter was tasty.
Highly recommended!"
4,"A surprisingly awesome place in the mid of the peacful girgaon district. super friendly stuff, food is excellent and comes with a set of onions, some masala and spices to adjust your meal to your very personal preferences.
One of the few and best places in mumbai which serves veg and drinks too!!!
Drinks especially alcohol are very well priced and the waiters suggest you their special spicy starters which could go with them when asked.Good food with best ambiance"
5,"RelaxRelaxing place, drinks with lots of snacks, and I'm really happy with the owner of this restaurant who has really taught the waiters to be nice to all people.  Amazing place in Mumbai for family drinks.  The owner has very nicely informed the people working there because for the first time I have seen him taking care of all the visitors in a restaurant who come to drink or eat.  I said because today I went and I felt it myself."
4,"This is a pretty nice place with average interiors, well behaved staff, generously prepared tasty dishes but overpriced drinks and a few other items. If it is on your way, it is a place to stop by.
I have tried their Lahori Kofta, Masala Kulcha, Paneer tikka biryani, Kachumar Raita, Sweet and Salty lemon soda. This is a pure veg restaurant, you should know."
4,"Very nice restaurants to celebrate your special events like birthday, anniversary etc.  Food is, good atmosphere excellent, service good.  Must try at least once."
1,"Worst mithai pedaüôÇ
ReasonS:-
Full Yellow colour.
Costly.
Could be easily cut by a knife which indicated something fishy.
Worsttttttttt would even rate 0 star , go for any other sweet shop not this"
2,"Since two times I am visiting this shop, they are not providing me the product that I want even when it's available.The shopkeeper is very stubborn and rude."
2,"Ordered rajvadi peda but the person gave normal peda, and when told to the owner about this, the owner is not ready to accept, just for 50 rs difference in half kg as though the customer is lying for 50 rs."
5,"Best rasgulla and fresh always . It is an old sweet shop and everything is good and fresh. Malai sandwich , rasgulla, chamcham"
3,"All time fresh sweets. Loved the jumbo rosogulla.

At present they do not accept digital payments and near by ATMs are limited; one which i used was Union Bank which is located approx 200 meter far from the shop."
1,"Today I visited at charni Road Domino's for taking burger. I request to two people to take my order. First of all they refused & told me to wait. Near about I am waiting 15 minutes. I saw so many people inside but no one taking order. Just neglecting the customer. If I demand complaints suggestions book they don't have. They given me cancellation register for writing the complaint. This is very highly objectionable thing. This complaint will be
Registered in consumer forum. How dare to neglect the customer when the customer arrives in your premises."
1,"As I can see the back to back negative reviews for this store, totally agreed with it. Really need to change the staff. Visited here for light snacks, the lady at the billing desk so arrogant and continuously arguing. I request her speak politely with customer, she not even accepting her mistake, being a front line worker this branch need special training, need to train how to behave with customer. Seriously very poor service.

I will never recommend this store at all."
1,"The worst donimos there is in Mumbai. The person who owns this franchise should read this review, the staff is extremely rude and for the second straight time I was denied dine in at the restaurant with a lame excuse that there are alot of online orders. A basic etiquette is making sure any dine in customer is served well. Denying food to dine in customers, karma will do its thing. Dominos please take note whom you hand over your brand to! Such work ethics will take you down. I was denied dine in at 9 pm."
1,"First went to the tardeo branch there was ac problem as usual then went to charni road dominos First of all in this summer season the ac was set on 32 so i just told the person on counter that its hot please adjust the temperature, the person who was preparing pizza inside started altering things from there
And started saying itna hi hai ac n all and started saying video mat nikalo i said i am not taking any video
Then he was saying the other person ac band kardo
Then i told him say on camera that ac band karo
I warn him that ill complaint then he adjusted the temperature of the ac
He was talking like he is the owner Worst service worst staff (name firoz)"
1,"I hope I could give negative markings to this place!
Horrible experience! Dirty and unhygienic place and unprofessional staff

On 3rd March we visited this place for a quick meal at 8pm. It took them 30 mins to place the order. After paying didn't receive the bill. Previous customers waiting for their order started arguing with the staff as they were waiting since almost an hour! Immediately I cancelled my order.

As I paid by credit card, I was told my money would get refunded in 7 days. It's the 8th day now and no refund yet!
Wonder if they cancelled the order or no.

The counter guy named Santosh and store manager Mohsin have given their contact numbers but Santosh's number provided is incorrect and Mohsin is not reachable!

Their wash basin didn't have any water as well.

Please eat at a roadside stall rather than eating here!!

They are just too horrible!!!!"
1,"Pathetic service to say the least. Food was not warm. Staff was in a mess... Came here with family and friends to celebrate an event and it got screwed up badly.

Every other guest from other tables were shouting.

Third grade place specially on weekends.

Visit at your own risk. A BIG NO !!"
4,"Food was very good but very costly. For 2 it costed us around Rs.3.5k.
We tried veg sushi, brocolli shorba, 2 mocktails, bajra and palak roti with dal tadka and barabanki kofta. In starters we had one corn dish which was amazing.
Overall it was a nice experience."
3,"I ordered veg biryani, crystal dumplings, and bihari sev puri. Crystal dumplings were so bad, I'm sorry but they tasted really weird. Bihari sev puri and biryani were just fine, not too good.

The staff were nice, patient and polite. The view of the beach was nice."
5,"Revival is an absolute gem for vegetarians! The staff is incredibly polite, and Mr. Kamlesh Barot was an absolute delight warmly welcoming us and even accommodating our table when we arrived 30 minutes late. I've completely fallen in love with this spot nestled in the heart of Girgaum Chowpatty."
5,"Revival offers a quintessential vegetarian dining experience with stunning sea views. Known for its Golden Thali, the restaurant serves a wide array of flavorful dishes in traditional Kansa utensils, which adds a unique health-conscious touch. The Rajasthani-themed interiors and courteous staff elevate the experience, though service can be a bit slow during peak hours. If you're craving authentic North Indian, Gujarati flavors, and their newly launched Asian cuisine, Revival's blend of great food and serene ambiance is a must-try, especially for those who appreciate a relaxed meal by the beach."
3,Service was decent but the waffles was not so good.I ordered triple chocolate and the waffles was so soggy.Hazelnut cappuccino was ok ok too.Not so good outlet of Belgian waffle in terms of taste.Seating area is good.
5,My go to dessert is the choco brownie sundae. The staff is really polite. Love the ambience.
1,"The employee was very rude. They are watching reels while you sit upstairs with full volume. Air conditioner is not working. Stairs are very uncomfortable to climb. Due to self service policy the rude employee wouldn't serve upstairs. Ordered something in beverages, was also available in a waffle , so they did not exchange. The lady's name is Anjuman, she was very rude."
1,"My recent visit to charni road outlet left much to be desired. Despite the enticing aroma of freshly made waffles, the service was incredibly disappointing. The staff seemed disinterested and inattentive, taking an eternity to acknowledge our presence and fulfill our orders. Furthermore, the waffles, when they finally arrived, were undercooked and lacked the promised toppings. Overall, a regrettable experience that fell far short of expectations. Management needs to address these issues."
1,"Didn‚Äôt provide a plate, and wouldn‚Äôt give anything to eat the waffle in. When asked, they were asking for additional money. Very poor experience with the staff."
3,"This is an out and out Gujarati vegetarian food restaurant which is well known for its authentic Gujarati food. I personally dislike the entire menu of Thali. We had a get together and decided to go for Thali. I was hesitant to go for this restaurant as the food items are not my favourites, hence ended up eating very few things. Most of the items are ones that we eat in day to day life. Core Gujarati food lovers may enjoy it. For me no value for money."
2,"I had recently visited to this place which is very very well known for gujarati thali. But to my surprise it was nothing but fish market. Very bad service. We had booked table for 13 and three of guests where about to come they were just behind us, the staff said your guest can adjust I need one table bcz we have waiting. I mean I understand but we were 13 ppl, that pissed me the attitude of the staff. Secondly they started just serving is with the plates and food like fat fat khao and futo. I mean if we are paying 750+ taxes for thali it's obvious we will enjoy and eat but that wasn't case. Good public but it was nuisance, I felt as if I mean some catering service bas khila k bhaga diya. This restaurant is know for its name and thali with that intention we came from central but not worth. I won't recommend as staff is not welcoming we literally completed thali in 30mins( domino ka pizza thodi khana tha) and when we finished they literally said then please clear the bill we have waiting. I am sorry I won't pay 750/-+ taxes for this place second time I would recommend tip top or Maharaja bhog. Food was okay not that great."
5,"Thackers Verdict on Balora, Malad

Arey boss, Balora is top-class if you‚Äôre a veg food lover. Full paisa vasool experience. Went there with the gang and I must say ‚Äì ambiance ekdum classy, but not the overacting types. Simple, elegant, and comfy.

We tried their Paneer Lababdar ‚Äì bhai, that gravy was buttery smooth and packed with masala magic. Pav Bhaji Platter? Arre wah ‚Äì proper Mumbai street style but with a 5-star finish. And don‚Äôt even get me started on that Beet Uramaki Roll ‚Äì fusion game strong!

Staff was sweet, service was fast, and the vibe? Total chill scenes. Rates are decent for the quality and quantity you get."
5,"Excellent quality and taste of satvik Jain food.  The banquet lunch was loved by every single one of the 100 guests.  The ambiance, decor of the conveniently located hall on the ground floor is wonderful.  With slightly better pricing it would attract even more clients."
5,"The experience is unmatched
Food is delightful, service is warm, pleasant. Team is indeed one of the best and takes care of guests well. Waiting time is definitely there for such kind of food. The food option for kids is also there other then Gujarati thali. Location in south mumbai is definitely great"
5,"I haven‚Äôt tasted such yummy Aamras before! Khana Khazana is truly one of the best hotels for a delightful meal. Other food items are also delicious, and the ambience is top-notch with a comfortable air-conditioned setting."
5,"I tried their north indian cuisine and let me tell you this place serves authentic and flavourful dishes. Do visit, it‚Äôs pocket friendly and near to charni road station and available in Jain too!"
5,"I came to Mumbai for tour and had food here twice. Quality and taste both were great.
Their dosas are really something. I tried chowmein dosa based on the google reviews only and it really was upto the reputation guys.
Also tried paneer items and they too were tasty. Shop was hygienic.
Good job. Keep it up guys."
5,"‚úî **Delicious Food** ‚Äì Standout dishes: [ I tired their Gujarati Thali which so tasty and delicious].
‚úî **Great Ambiance** ‚Äì [e.g., Cozy, modern, romantic, lively].
‚úî **Excellent Service** ‚Äì Attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable staff.
‚úî **Good Portion Sizes** ‚Äì Worth the price.

Khana Khazana  was great place is have tried their Gujarati thali which was so tasty and you can have many more iteams which were delicious üòã  I‚Äôd recommend it for all to visit this place but wolud suggest you to try their special Gujarati Thali  which content amras puri,Khichdi wid kadhi,Butter khichya wid chat masala . It was all of guju theme
üìçAmbiance
Walking into *The Olive Grove*, I was immediately struck by its warm, inviting atmosphere. The d√©cor blends rustic charm with modern elegance‚Äîthink exposed brick walls, soft Edison bulb lighting, and lush greenery. The open kitchen adds an exciting energy, and the gentle hum of conversation (paired with subtle Mediterranean-inspired music) creates a lively yet intimate vibe. It‚Äôs perfect for date nights or small group gatherings, though the noise level can rise during peak hours.
üìçThe Food: Standouts
The menu is a creative take on Mediterranean classics with a Pacific Northwest twist.
üìçService & Experience**
Service was impeccable- server, Marco, was attentive without being intrusive, expertly guiding us through the wine pairings. The kitchen paced dishes well, though our reservation was delayed by 15 minutes due to high demand."
5,"I order Pav bhaji and Veg biryani üòç

Surely it deserve 5 star rating ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
Including discounts it cost around 350 for both.

Pav bhaji
It was packed in a container ü§© No leakage
2 Pav served with Onion and lemon packed separately.
The taste was aesome üòç and very delicious üòã Tomato was cut very fine and the pav with butterüòç really mouth watering.

Veg biryani
It was also packed perfectly.
Served with Raita was packed seperately and Onion and Lemon.
The quantity was good enough easly serve for 2 people for a quick bite and less foody people."
4,"I had better expectations from Mumbai pav bhaji, but this was a good pav bhaji."
4,We ordered pavbhaji here ... The taste was good but the charges Rs.10 for an extra pav which is quiet expensive.... Overall taste was good service vr a Little slow. There were less people to manage ...
5,Person was loyal  I have made payment  230 inspite of 2203    shop person call me and return the spare money
3,I ordered double butter pav bhaji was tasting sour it was not upto the mark and cheese ragda pattice was also not good.
4,The pav bhaji at this centre is same as that of other stalls in girgaon chowpaty.
5,"Apsara Icecreams is a very popular chain service & serves the best ice creams in the city.They are truly the pioneers of making the most unique ice creams. The simplistic yet great thought that goes behind adding Masala to the Guava ice cream makes them the best!!
We tried: Guava flavor & sitafal flavor
They actually have the crust of fruits in it u can taste sitafal in the ice cream, they have their attraction point which is the guava ice cream they serve it with the guava masala on the ice cream which added an amazing flavor to it.
Try these flavours and be delighted. Amazing range of flavours being served here making the overall Experience delightful for ice cream lovers."
5,"They have really yummy and natural fruit flavour ice creams. Love them alll!!

Guava ice cream comes with the tasty guava masala as a add on... something very unique and interesting.
Brownie blast for choclate lovers"
5,"The ice Cream was great and flavours are nature and I gave tried
Asli Alphonse (highly recommend)
Guava glory
Belgian bite (must try)
Roasted almonds (highly recommend)

Taste - 5/5
Packaging - 5/5"
4,"Apsara Ice Creams is one of the leading Ice cream parlors of Mumbai. They offer a variety of options from Choclate to Natural fruit flavors.
They offer you in 3-4 options.
Small scoop, large scoop, cone.
Guava is their best! Even watermelon Sorbe is good.
We tried Targola recently which wasn't that great."
2,"Two star only because i liked icecream. They were having Ganesh Chaturthi special Boondi Modakam icecream. Staff was extremely rude. Apasara icecream is a renowned brand, would never visit this branch because staff was extremely rude."
5,"Located opposite of Girgaon Chowpatty. Parking is available here. It is branch of famous Amar Fast food. Tried Paneer chilli, pavbhaji and dahi batata puri. Food was excellent in taste. Service was quick too."
5,"One of my absolute favourite outlets in Mumbai for gulping different cuisines of foods at one place. No wonder the pav bhaji is not over rated at all.

Pizza(picture attached) was okayish but rawa masala dosa from this place is my favourite. The kit kat shake was okayish as well. Chilli paneer was great.

The best part about this place is its location that's exactly on the sea face in front of girgaun chowpatty. Enjoy your day at marine drive and have healthy, tasty and fresh food with great taste at amar juice. Happy eating :)"
5,"Great place for snack, juices and desert beverages. They have the best pav bhaji and masala pav in the town along with chat. South Indian food items are very good as well. Prices are little higher on the side but it's worth the money. One plus point is they have valet parking available in such a busy area. The location is great right across the chowpatty (beach) but they don't have ton of tables inside so expect some wait during busy period such as weekend evenings."
4,"Very good place to enjoy delicious fast food. Excellent service by Saddam. Tried Paubhaji, Tawa Pulaav, Sev Puri, Panipuri and Faluda. Each dish was delicacy. Enjoyed the evening with friends.

Only drawback is tables are very close by. Had a very noisy family behind us with children who were boisterous."
3,It is just located opposite girgaon Chowpatty...was here with my friends..service was fast..staffs wer polite..for me taste was not upto the mark...we tried masala pav..jain pav bhaji.. normal pav bhaji..masala papad...cheese corn ball..dry manchurian..manchao soup..paneer chilly... Manchao soup was awsm..othrs was okk.... give it a try..just once
5,"What a lovely restaurant..
And such a courteous and sweet staff..
Amazing food.. Very good quality..
And a variety they have..
A must for every asian food lover‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Dimsums, soups, fiery cottage cheese all are better than the other"
5,The Food was Excellent not spicy not Greasy .... Authentic Food... My whole family loved it.... Ambience quiet and Peaceful.
3,"If you like authentic Asian food, this can be your go to place. With Vegetarian and Jain options, this place has a lot to offer, however, if you like Indian Chinese, you might not like the food. But you can definitely visit for the authenticity of this restaurant. You‚Äôll find unique desert options here, so do make it a point to eat something sweet from here."
5,Authentic Thai food is served here. Place is small buy food is mind blowing tasty. We had an amazing time here. The staff is very courteous too. To top that the locality that it's located is cherry on the cake too.
5,"This restaurant captures the essence of Asian street food beautifully. Whether you're looking for a quick bite or a full meal, it delivers an enjoyable culinary experience. Highly recommended for foodies and casual diners alike!"
5,"Delicious Sea Food and Awesome varieties of Crab, Surmai, Pomfret And Prawns. Chicken Mutton and Egg dishes are also available. Place is small with limited seating capacity but food is very good. Rates are reasonable."

5,"The design is not fancy but man the vibe is one of the best service fantastic everybody did their job with big smile
Not expert in Indian food
But the butter nan was amazing
I would visit them again for sure"
4,"One of the best place to eat butter chicken at pocket friendly rates!

Ordered following
1) Butter chicken
2) 4 x Roti
3) sol kadi

And guess how much was the bill

Just 293 rs!

Yeah you heard anything üëç

Really good pocket friendly place to have lunch / dinner

Extremely quick service

And awesome food!"
5,The Best Of mumbai ..for mangalorian food...seafood speciality
4,"Good Food , Affordable Price , Vintage Feel !! Nice place grab a bite with friends .
Tried Omlet , Bhurji & kheema !! Must try their Chai & Bun Maska !! Tastes good, service is slightly slow but mainly because they prepare everything fresh.

Parking is not available so keep that in mind."
5,"Prawn Biryani and Prawn Pulao were awesome.

Not any side effects next day after eating food too üå∂Ô∏è"
4,"Average place to have food with your friends üëçüèª, place is bit cozy and have small tables so please don‚Äôt order many things at a time table will be full."
5,Very quick service her.. chinese food is their speciality. Best night place near saifee hospital Charni road #drajaypuri
4,"When I was in Mumbai, I tried the biryani, and it was absolutely delicious! The flavors were rich and perfectly balanced, with each bite being a burst of authentic taste. I instantly fell in love with it! Highly recommend trying their biryani if you're in Mumbai ‚Äì it‚Äôs a must-have for any biryani lover!"
3,Old Parsi restaurant run by 3rd Generation owner and chef. Inside is a time capsule that has seen better days. Owner needs to be asked about availability of any item as there's no printed menu. Food quality and ambience doesn't justify the price. Can improve immensely on cleanliness.
5,"A Charming Gem

Truly a genuinely nice place. It has an honest and true old-world charm that transports you to a different era. The atmosphere is inviting, and the authenticity is evident in every detail. A visit here is like a step back in time, filled with warmth and character."
5,"Travel back in time at this 90 year-old cafe - and enjoy one of the best keema pav and pudina chai ever.
Gustad, third-generation owner is a one-man army who is the chef, host and everything in the middle:) Please don‚Äôt miss it!"
1,"Went to this place. No customers around.
Asked the person inside who was cleaning the table to give menu card. His reply: No menu card, only bun maska and omlette available. If we need to order anything else for lunch, we need to order in the morning 9am.  As ridiculous as it gets"
5,Nice place .. quaint ambiance .. food is delicious ‚Ä¶ bit on the expensive side .. i went there after reading an article in Indian Express
5,One of the very good place to eat south indian food. Specially medu vada sambar. Medu vada is big in size but crispy from outside and spongy inside. Super tasty.  We ordered malasa pav which I feel is perfectly priced at ‚Çπ 80 only.  Absolutely delicious in taste with right balance of pav bhaji masala.  Quantity is sufficient for one person.  I would highly recommend malasa pav to try at this place. Quality of food maintained over the last 20 yrs is exceptional. They also serve Chinese and Punjabi. Punjabi food is mostly garlicky. Chinese is good in taste. Medu vada and masala pav are much have dishes.
4,"Food Quality: Raja Refreshment serves delicious food and pure veg. Each dish is bursting with flavor, made with fresh ingredients and authentic spices.

Ambiance: The restaurant has a cozy and inviting atmosphere, perfect for enjoying a meal with friends and family.you'll feel right at home.

Service: The staff is friendly, attentive, and goes above and beyond to ensure a pleasant dining experience. They're always ready to assist with menu recommendations and special requests.

Overall, Raja Refreshment offers tasty food, a comfortable ambiance, and excellent service, making it a must-visit spot on Charni Road,Girgaum"
4,"Inshort: Great For a Budget Outing!

MustTry: Masala Chap, Kurkure Kebab, and Kaju Paneer Masala üòç

Parking: 4 wheeler not available at all.

Payment Modes: CARDS, CASH, UPI

I recently visited this small local restaurant and I must say, I was blown away by the delicious food! From the Masala Chap to the Kurkure Kebab and Kaju Paneer for the main course, everything was simply amazing. The flavors were so well balanced and authentic, it was clear that a lot of care had gone into preparing each dish.

What's even better is that the prices are really reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food. I highly recommend trying the dosa and sambhar as well, they are must-tries! The dosa was perfectly crispy and the sambhar had just the right amount of spice.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is cozy and welcoming, and the staff are very friendly and attentive. I truly enjoyed my experience here and will definitely be back to try more of their dishes. If you're looking for some delicious, authentic Indian food at a great price, this is the place to go!"
4,"I have been eating Idli Wada from this place since I was a kid.
People who have known this restaurant since ages mostly visit here. Their customers are majorly from the nearby locality.

Post COVID, they have made many changes and additions in their Menu.
To make it more appealing, the restaurant has started Souh Indian dishes offer ranging between Rs. 59 and Rs. 75. It's available all day. No time restrictions. You can also try a Chinese thali worth Rs. 250. It contains 3 items viz. Paneer Chilly/Paneer Crispy/ Schezwan Paneer, Noodles or Fried Rice and Manchurian Gravy.

I was about to faint from hunger so we decided to visit a nearby restaurant. We ordered a Mysore Masala Dosa  Ulandu Dosa, Chinese thali - Paneer Chilly, Fried Rice and Manchurian Gravy an (photos attached).

Value for money - 5/5
Food - 4/5 (Didn't like Ulandu Dosa)
Ambience - 3/5 (Not spacious enough)"
5,"Yesterday me and my friends visited Raja refreshment we enjoy a lot
We tried various dishes from menu like veg Manchow soup, Paneer Tikka and chop etc
Also we tried various variety in biryani like Chettinad biryani ,Awadhi biryani
Specially I recommended awadhi biryani, they use perfect spices in biryani belive me guys Awadhi Biryani is a perfect choice for veg lovers
also staff and owner was very humble,they suggested us best dishes from their menu
Overall our dine experience was awesome üòçüòç"
5,"The Quarter and The Royal Opera House! Killer combo! Its the coolest venue in town! Had been to the Quarter to watch Ridu, Abhinav and Andrew. Sound was phenomenal and the ambiemce was perfect for a jazz audience. Enjoyed the sound under the influence of an amazing acoustic treatment. Was on a killer pocket crunch! So couldn't really order much, except for a cocktail, that the ticket entitled me to. Considering the location, it of course is not a very pocket friendly place! So be sure you have a good deal to spend, before you head out for a fine dinner experience! Has a open air seating area, which I am sure, is not the most ideal place during summers! But fortunately, I was visiting on a February evening, I had a good time! A 5 star and a must visit place for good food, a posh environment and the best music possible in town!"
5,"I loved the place, the ambience is very pretty and also the food was good.
They have 4 sections, one is a cafe, one is open air , one is bar and the other is a tiny room where you can book and sit for shows and match screenings, therefore it's called quarter as it has four parts.
The person serving us was named Binoy Das and he gave us a wonderful detailed explanation of the place and the food.
They serve pizzas, sphaghetti, fries, desserts and many other things.
So we had the nachos and they were yummy with guacamole and sour cream.
Then we ordered mushroom poutine and it was super yummyüíï.
For dessert we had a red quinoa dessert, it was different, but yummy. We also had cold coffee and it was pretty good too.
We loved the entire experience."
5,"My TEAM thoroughly enjoyed shooting POP ROCK NIGHT with ANUSHKA JAG. Love the vibes, amazing food, drinks. I would love to visit this place for wine, dine and music ofcourse. Truly a jem in SOBO."
3,"There is a reason for giving this place a 3 star rating.
It‚Äôs not because of the food, neither because of the ambiance, it‚Äôs just because of the quality of service.
The staff is very snooty, snobbish and rude and not only to me but to 3 other guests who were there.
We were there by 7:50 pm and the place was empty, we asked for a table for 2. We were told that since you have walked in the tables are all reserved.
We requested them that we were only there for an hour and had to leave by 9 pm. With much hesitation we were offered a table. By the time we finished our dinner it was 9:35 pm and still 4 tables stayed unoccupied.

A lady walked in with a friend and her kid and the kid being very hungry they requested for a table and the staff replied in the same way.. we do not have tables. All tables are reserved. When the lady asked the staff to be put through the manager; he responded by saying that ‚ÄúI am the senior most authority‚Äù.

You cannot shun your customers away.
Being in the hospitality industry a degree of professionalism and courtesy has to be displayed.

The serving staff too was inattentive. They had to be called several times before they halfheartedly attended the table.

Hope the management takes attention to its customers grievances.

Now coming to the food:
The food was fresh and delicious.
We ordered the black hammus with pitabread and that was fabulous.

The pasta was creamy and the flavour tongue tickling.

The wine list is limited though.

The ambiance is one of the best you can ever imagine in the middle of the hustle and bustle of one of the most busiest parts of Mumbai."
5,"I visited The Quarter for the first time for a live Jazz event. It has regular live music nights, I believe. It has an extensive menu for alcohol but not for non-alcoholic beverages. Being a teetotaler, I really wish such places would offer more variety in milkshakes and mocktails. I'd wanted one of the milkshakes they had on the menu, but had to settle with a Hibiscus Tea Sangria."
3,"This was my second visit to the restaurant. This time, I tried the Sicilian Chicken and Parmesan Crusted Chicken. While both dishes were decent, they didn‚Äôt quite live up to my expectations. Given the restaurant‚Äôs reputation, I had hoped for more flavorful and well-balanced dishes. However, the service, valet, and ambience were great, which added to the overall experience. Still, based on the food alone, I‚Äôd rate it three stars."
4,"Really liked Canto! The food was super tasty, the vibe was great, and the staff was friendly. It‚Äôs a bit on the pricier side, but totally worth it for a nice evening out. Would happily go again!"
4,"We visited Canto last night for dinner and had a good time! Even though it was a Friday evening and we didn't have reservations, we were seated almost immediately after coming in. The vibe of the cafe was laid-back and there was a live DJ as well who was playing good music (shout-out to him!). Service could have been a bit more effective as we found ourselves repeatedly having to look around and flag down the staff. For food we ordered the stir fry vegetables, hara bhara kabab, potato wedges with garlic herbs and chocolate brownie with vanilla ice-cream. We enjoyed all the dishes and thought the plating was well done. For drinks, I got the LIIT, which was good, but did feel a bit watered down compared to others I've tried. Overall, would recommend it as a cute spot for a cozy night out!"
5,"I recently dined at Canto and had a wonderful experience. The food was excellent, offering a variety of delicious options. The ambiance was lovely, with a modern and inviting atmosphere. The service was top-notch, with friendly and attentive staff. Overall, Canto is a fantastic choice for good food, great ambiance, and excellent service. Highly recommended!"
4,The food is just delicious with cozy vibes.  I had ordered chicken tikka which was amazing. The ambience and the atmosphere is just perfect to relax.
4,"So this place is located in Chowpatty and near Sukh Sagar as well.The place serves italian and mexican food.The service was excellent and the atmosphere was just amazing.The food that we ordered was garlic bread,pizza,nachos,Half bean taco which were all average.The problem was also with the taco which was very small for it,s price.This place is overall decent but the service was just top notch."
4,"We went there on a Saturday evening for dinner and the place was full, we waited for a few mins and luckily got a table shortly. The atmosphere was like a regular restaurant nothing fancy and no loud music so great for get togethers with friends or family.
We had the Mexican nachos (with beans an cheese) and loved ittttt! I‚Äôm someone who loves cream center nachos and these came very close to that.
We also had the burrito bowl which we didn‚Äôt enjoy so much so wouldn‚Äôt recommend that. Next up was aglio olio and we were very surprised that we loved that too - right amount of garlic and oil. Also had the onion rings, the quantity is mad so keep some space for it if you love it.
In drinks - we had the lime ice cream soda and peach iced tea both were good."
4,"It is a nice cosy little place. It has an amazing aroma of food, felt as soon as one enters.
The food served was rich in texture and delicious.
The staff is very friendly and helpful. The menu is inclined towards Italian and Mexican with their speciality being different types of Nachos.
We ordered Mexican Tomato Soup, Bean tacos half half pizza. It was a thick soup, with bits of Nachos in it.
The tacos were also very good. The flavour of beans was more of Indian side but good. The shell was fresh and crispy.
Concept of half half pizza was good. You get to taste two flavours in one. Half was creamy mushroom and half was hot spicy.
Churros was our dessert but not very great.
It has a display which shows the photo of food, which can help you order.

If you like Mexican and Italian a place to be visited for sure."
4,"Good food place . They serve quite good veg food. A bit pricey side, but that's okay as per location. Sitting is okay.
The service is good .
Some dishes take a bit longer to be served but most of them will be on time.
The drinks are good too
Good place in that area if looking for veg food.
P.s - they add services charge in bill,  you can remove that if not needed."
2,"I had heard so much good about this place but my experience was contrasting.

We ordered nachos, soup, sizzler,  cheese corn balls, etc and nothing was exceptional.

The service was poor with a lot of delay. I had to keep asking about the status of my order. Once someone else's order was served to me.

The place os cramped up and atmosphere not very pleasant

There is no parking outside and if you come in car, better keep 10 mins just to find the parking slot.

To conclude, can try once but that too on weekdays. Do not think of coming on weekends or during peak period."
3,"This cozy vintage-style caf√© has limited seating and a fairly minimal menu, especially during late afternoon hours. The food and drinks were decent. Usually it is a nice spot to relax and enjoy a chilled beer. Keep in mind‚Äîthey only accept cash, so plan ahead before your visit."
5,"What a find of a cafe! Delicious food, very attentive service, a wide diversity of dishes, and all this is extra location for reasonable price.
The place has a very relaxed, bit alternative atmosphere (for Mumbay, that is); worth noting are old comic strips on walls and an ancient American music box. Recommended!"
5,"If you are looking for a relaxed, vintage vibed place from the Brit era to just chill with your group, this is the place to be! Great service with staff that has been there since ages! Great ambience for all Retro Bollywood lovers - Govinda, Akshay Kumar, Early Shahrukh and Amir Khan songs play on loop here all the time! Nostalgia hits you to the core for all the 90's kids out there! Food is amazing with spread from Indian, Conti, Italian and also Pizzas are to die for! Freshly cooked or baked, every bite is delicious ü§§ Beers served at MRP and the crowd just chilling and vibing to the old time songs.a Must Visit if you are in the vicinity!"
4,"The food quality and quality is good. And the service is prompt. But the place was pretty empty with a couple of tables occupied by college locals. I missed the feel, vibe and ambience of a restaurant and felt more like a local caf√©. The price of dishes could have been a bit on lower side. Can't call it as a must visit kind of place."
4,"This Irani cafe is a place with a slow living chill vibe, serves only egg dishes, no nonveg option. Good quantity as well as taste.

The location is opposite Girgaon Chowpati so you get a nice view while having a choice of your beverage.

Only cash payment, no Upi/card accepted."
5,"Sukh Sagar is a fantastic restaurant that offers a delicious and authentic Indian dining experience. From the moment you step inside, you are greeted by a warm and welcoming atmosphere that makes you feel right at home.

The food at Sukh Sagar is exceptional, with a wide variety of dishes that cater to all tastes and preferences. Each dish is bursting with flavor and prepared with the freshest ingredients. The menu offers a great selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, and there are plenty of options for those with dietary restrictions.

The service at Sukh Sagar is also outstanding, with friendly and attentive staff who go above and beyond to ensure that your dining experience is enjoyable. The restaurant is spacious and well-lit, with comfortable seating that makes it the perfect place to relax and enjoy a meal with friends and family.

The prices at Sukh Sagar are also very reasonable, making it a great value for money. The portions are generous, and you definitely won't leave hungry.

Overall, I would highly recommend Sukh Sagar to anyone looking for an exceptional Indian dining experience. The food is outstanding, the service is top-notch, and the atmosphere is warm and welcoming. Whether you're a fan of Indian cuisine or just looking to try something new, Sukh Sagar is definitely worth a visit."
5,"The idlis are real soft and very fulfilling. The idlis will melt the moment you put it in your mouth. üòçüòçüòçüòç

They will pour generous amounts of fresh coconut chutney as and when requested. Must visit for idli lovers.

They also serve pau bhaji and pizza."
5,"Its one of the oldest Restaurants in Colaba. The entire lane is full of there other business only. Sukh Sagar is one the food brands which you can trust blindly. Their big and aired Bhature were delicious, their Chole had light amount of sweetness which makes it a perfect combination. The Dal fry was thick and tasty. The biryani is our go to food as we love their taste soo much that everytime we order this first. Also they have options in Chinese, Mexican & Italian. The brand is maintaining their dignity and taste since 1961.I suggest you to visit this place whenever you are in Colaba."
4,"The food was really delicious, the place was hygienic, and it is a locally known place. I recommend to eat there, service is fast too. Pav bhaji is my recommendation.
However, as a solo traveler, I did not also feel very comfortable because around ten waiters were watching me while eating and as soon as I finished my food, they gave me the bill as if they wanted me to leave."
5,"Nothing can beat the taste of Pav bhaji on Chowpatty other then this place. Our whole family is big fan of the place. This time again it was for pav bhaji and Veg. Fried rice. That same amazing taste. Quick service, lovely hospitality. Perfect ambience and courteous staff. Good Covid hygiene. Close to beach and station. Best to find North Indian, south indian Chinese and all street food under one roof at affordable cost."
5,"Strategically located near Girgaon Chowpatty and other famous eating places, this place offers you interesting options for a dessert after dinner. You can also munch on many options of waffles available here. Waffles were perfect combination of crunchiness and softness. Ice cream options were also good and worth a try."
5,They serve the best waffles in town! Perfect amount of soft and crisp. Pancakes were delicious but they weren't as fluffy as they should be. Can definitely skip their sundaes
1,Don't go there.  Even if they have 7 or 8 persons on duty the service is lausy. Now smile.  You wait for a coffee and a waffle nearly 10 minutes. Beeing the only guest they want you to pickup everything at the counter. The waffle has nothing in common with a Belgian waffle  and the cappuccino is one of the worst things I ever had. Therefore you pay 260Rup..
5,"The Belgian Waffle stalls at Chowpaty in Mumbai offer a delightful culinary experience that will tantalize your taste buds. These delectable treats are a must-try for any food lover visiting the city.
As you stroll along the bustling Chowpaty promenade, the aroma of freshly baked waffles wafts through the air, enticing you to indulge. The waffles are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, creating a perfect balance of textures. Topped with a generous helping of chocolate sauce, whipped cream, fresh fruits, or nuts, these waffles are a symphony of flavors.
The vibrant atmosphere of Chowpaty, coupled with the delicious waffles, creates a memorable experience. Whether you're visiting with friends or family, indulging in these delectable treats is a must-do activity. So, next time you're in Mumbai, make sure to head to Chowpaty and treat yourself to a mouthwatering Belgian waffle."
5,"Variety of waffles. The ones we liked were Naked Nutella, Chocolate Overload and Belgian Chocolates. The taste of the waffles are extremely mesmerising!!
The best thing about the outlet is it‚Äôs location. Best waffles in town....perfectly crisp on outside and smoothy chocolate inside.....ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞"
5,"Saheel Restaurant honestly blew me away! From the moment I walked in, the vibe was welcoming and cozy ‚Äî but it‚Äôs the food that truly steals the show üçΩÔ∏è.

Every dish I tried was full of flavor, cooked to perfection, and you can tell they really care about quality. The ingredients felt fresh, and the balance of spices was just chef's kiss üëå. Whether it was the starters, mains, or even the little touches like chutneys and sides ‚Äî everything was on point.

The service was super warm too. Friendly staff, quick service, and they actually check in to make sure you‚Äôre enjoying your meal ‚Äî which I really appreciated ‚ù§Ô∏è.

It‚Äôs the kind of place where you finish eating and already start planning your next visit. If you're someone who values both taste and quality, Saheel is a must-try ‚úÖ. Highly recommend giving it a shot ‚Äî your taste buds will thank you!"
5,"Always a great place for a quick lunch or dinner.
Affordable prices and a variety of food is available here.
Must try their Paya Soup in the morning"
1,I have bought fried rice in parcel for rs 100 at 1.30 06 april 2025 the quantam was good but the taste is like you cant eat a dirty taste very bad a local fried rice shop wouldnl make better very bad I will never buy from jow onward waste of money and will create stuff in your stomach
3,Sanitation was a little issue( main bathroom did not have water only plus they gave us unclean glasses) food was good üëç
3,Good...can be better in terms of quality
2,"This is one of the worst as they switch off the air conditioning system in spite of charging a hefty 450 rupees for 650 ml beer. What else can you expect from this bar. So called,  Discovery. We wasted our money to this stupid bar as they try to reduce their electricity bill by charging heavily from their customers."
5,Just love it Superb experience ‚ô•Ô∏è

4,Food is awesome.....food quality is awesome....I have taken 2 idali and 2 mendu wada...in just 45 rs.....near by chuna bhatti station...just 2 min away from station... located just side to the main road.... thank you.
1,Speak of variety of food then mostly many things are good . Slightly over priced . However in today‚Äôs customer service owner is rude and has no ethics to speak to his customers. They normally cheat when taken bulk orders with a fact that they cannot handle . Issue is they themselves don‚Äôt prepare it‚Äôs all outsourced . When complained they don‚Äôt listen and put blame back on you
5,"Amazing food.. had dosa at the counter, good one after a long time, would recommend going with family. The owners keep a close watch on quality and cleanliness. Later found they have good assortment of sweets as well in shop inside. Overall a great place in Chunabhatti."
5,"Shree ji food is a veg snack corner located near chunabhatti Railway Station. They have a whole variety of snack items ranging from chakli,chips,khari, toast,dhokla, samosa,khakra etc.  And they also have a whole variety of sweets.They also keep chocolate gift boxes. Packaging is also good.  You can also get sandwich, pizza, pav bhaji, burger, pulav and South Indian food. They also make some innovative somosas (cheese, paneer, dry fruits) they also prepare Jain snacks on order.
The service is  quick. all the items looked fresh and tasted delicious.

5,"No frills, no fuss.  Quiet little eatery that serves simple and flavourful vegetarian fare. If you are near Sion and want a quick uncomplicated meal that tastes like home - go, eat and be satisfied."
5,"Sowmya & Venkat, Thank you for the extremely tasty Onam Sadhya. üëåüëåüëåüëåEach food items were very neatly packed. We all relished the feast. Very meticulously organised & delivered on time üëçüëèüëè. In the pic below, puli inji is hidden under the big round pappadam.üòú"
5,"It is an excellent place to have an authentic South Indian lunch meal. These people are from Palakkad so the Rasams, Sambars and Avials are to die for. You have to wait for your turn to eat. They take people in batches since everything is served thali style. Sambar and Rasam are unlimited and the rest of the extra items are paid. It is an excellent value for money meal catering to the masses; hence the prices are low. They only serve lunch. Zomato and Swiggy are enabled. A must visit place in Sion."
1,The hotel manager/owner is very very rude and only cares about money I went there today. She didn't even care to explain nicely what is in the thali. Very rude. Don't go there unless you want to be humiliated. Disappointed. The food is also not worth the hype. Very watery food.üëéüëé
5,"One of the oldest lunch homes in Sion. I distinctly remember being introduced to this gem of a place by a college friend in the early 90s. A meal cost around 30 bucks then. But the quality of the food has remained the same as it was - wholesome, homely, and with minimal oil. The meal consists of two chapattis, one dry veggie, one veggie with gravy (usually yummy), pickle or chutney, and unlimited rasam and sambar. The meal ends with a glass of buttermilk for digestion. Even today, the meal costs just 75 bucks. If you don't mind long queues and rubbing shoulders with strangers, for good food, this place is perfect for you. By the way, they are managed by the same  conglomerate which look after the older Mani's near Ruia college and the more recent one at Chembur."
5,"The best place to eat fish in Sion. I took their fish platter for dinner just to try. The taste was to die for and the quality of fish was top notch. The taste of the curry was very smooth and had an edge. What a beautiful establishment. I wish they never go out of business and thrive. I hope they keep up their phenomenal work.

P.S
The host Santosh Shetty was very humble and very polite."
4,"Nestled in the heart of Sion, Mumbai, Modern Lunch Home is a Safe-to-pocket and a foodie's paradise that promises an unforgettable seafood experience. Renowned for its authentic Malvani-style seafood, this eatery has garnered praise for its delectable offerings and warm hospitality.
The menu boasts a variety of coastal delicacies, with standout dishes like the Rawas fry, Surmai Fry, Rawas chilly ,Pomfret Curry and Prawns Biryani. Each dish is meticulously prepared, capturing the rich flavors of Malwani and Keralite cuisines.

A meal at Modern Lunch Home isn't complete without savoring their refreshing Sol Kadhi, a perfect accompaniment to the spicy seafood fare.
While the restaurant tends to get crowded during peak hours, especially on weekends, the wait is a small price to pay for the culinary delights that await."
5,"Visited this place on a busy sunday evening and what a blast we had ! ‚ô•Ô∏è
One of the best preparations of authentic manglorean cuisine.
We had the Marwai pundi (Rice dumplings in clams gravy) which is only prepared on the Sunday , Wednesday and Fridays - Must have

We also had bangude pulimunchi (Mackerel)
and Boothai Pilimunchi (Sardine) and Solefish fry.
Solkadhi to top it all up !‚ô•Ô∏è
Going to keep coming back and getting more friends everytime.."
4,"Superb NonVeg food for Seafood Lovers,. To start with I had Solkadi, which was yummy and tangy. After that I had Prawns ghee Roast which was OK as the gravy was smooth, viz need to add some spice or Masala. , After that  I had Pompret Tawa fry which was superb in taste and quality, I also had Chicken Biryani, Mutton Thali, and Chicken Thali with Kori roti and Appam. Overall very good place to dine out. Only drawback was the sitting g which was a little congested and need to add some more fans for Air Circulation."
5,"Good place for sea food in Mumbai. We tried pomfret fish taali with rice bhakri.

I also tried bombil fry,  Kane fish fry and sol kadi. All these items were really excellent.

The prawns ghee roast was also tasty. But the prawns were not deveined, which was not expected for a restaurant selling seafood at this price point.

I would definitely visit this place again, but would avoid ordering prawns items.

This part of the review is after my 2nd visit. I tried Pomfret thali, bombil fish fry and sol kadi. We also tried Crab thali this time, which was also equally good."
2,"Very bad Experience üòî,
Tried their Daily special and their burger didn't even have vegetables as I ordered cheese burst extra Cheese,
Their patty was made from cheese it was horrible to have that I had thrown itüò°"
4,Near Sion railway station. Good burgers at decent price. Get 2 for 1 on Fridays
1,Worst not clean and also the staff eating gutka and speaking to the cust after giving order we waited for 20 mins
2,"Kitchen not neat and clean, hygienic issues"
1,The Oreo shake i ordered was so bad it tasted bitter and sour it was tasting like the cream they used was expired i complaint to the worker he was no believing me i told him to taste my drink but he was not ready to check my drink and was very rude to me
5,"I have had the Gateway beers at a couple of places in Pune and Mumbai but had never been to the taproom. This time, I had the opportunity so decided to visit. They generally offer three complementary tasters of the beers but upon request they offered me four. I tried the Mosaic IPA, Lite IPA, Bombay Porter and the Spiced (Cinnamon) Porter. Absolutely smashing stuff! Had a pint of the Mosaic IPA, Lite IPA and the Bombay porter. Didn‚Äôt have the appetite to eat anything, but I hear the eight hour braised tenderloin is good, will try that when I visit them next. The service was prompt. Evan from the service team was very helpful."
5,"Gateway Taproom in Bandra BKC is an aesthetic spot, perfect for unwinding with loved ones or enjoying a vibrant atmosphere. It's a must-visit for beer enthusiasts, offering a variety of beers to try, especially after a hectic day. The ‚ÄúGateway to Istanbul‚Äù menu is a standout, featuring refreshing cocktails like the Bitter Orange Cranberry Treat and Citrus Black, both unique in presentation and flavor. We loved the taste of these cocktails!

The food experience was also exceptional. The chicken doner was absolutely mind-blowing, and the spiced chicken wings hit the spot. But it was the roasted beetroot and kumpir (a baked potato dish) that really surprised us with their unique flavors. The overall vibe was cozy, and the staff was attentive, guiding us through the menu with excellent service. We ended our meal with a delightful pistachio and puff baklava dessert that was nothing short of mouthwatering.

Overall, a perfect spot to relax, enjoy good drinks, great food, and a chill ambiance. We give it a 10/10 for a fantastic dining experience. Highly recommend it for cocktail and beer lovers!"
5,"Located in Bandra Kurla Complex, this place has an exquisite ambience and some really tasty food. The staff was also quite courteous and their recommendations were pretty awesome. They are offering a special culinary experience with their Gateway to Istanbul menu, so don't forget to check that out.

Taking you through some of the dishes we had:

Crispy Chickpeas Over Hummus (Recommended)

The all-time favorite hummus with crispy chickpeas placed over it and served with pita bread. The combination was absolutely yum.

Chicken Doner (Recommended)

Pita pocket filled with Turkish chicken and salad in garlic sause. This was really devouring and we relished every bite. It was served with fries that were too good as well.

MaC n Cheese Balls

Crispy coated crunchy balls filled with mac n cheese that has a rich and creamy flavour. Quite satisfying and a more comfort food.

Fish N Chips

Golden battered fish perfectly fried and served with tangy tartar sauce. The quantity is amazing for a small plate and it's served with really delicious fries.

Pistachio & Puff Baklava

Puff Baklava filled with crushed pistachio that is really sweet and served with whipped cream on top. Have your sugar tooth activated for this one.

For mocktails, we had Cold Coffee & Summer Cosmopolitan which was a mixture of apple, rasberry and cranberry.

Overall, we had a spectacular experience and loved everything about Gateway Taproom. It's a wonderful place to come for a date night or even have a meeting over lunch. We made a special request for the Hummus & Chicken Doner to be a part of their permanent menu, hopefully they oblige. Can't wait to visit again."
5,"Gateway Taproom in BKC is a solid spot if you‚Äôre into craft beers and good food! Definitely my go-to place when I want to unwind. I really like the Sidecar craft brew‚Äîsmooth and super easy to drink. The Lebanese platters are also great, especially if you want something flavorful to go with your drinks. Their cocktails are definitely worth a try‚Äîwell-made and refreshing. My personal favourites are the Moscow Mule and Whiskey Sour. Overall, it‚Äôs got a lively vibe. The music is not too loud so you can have easy conversations with friends. Would recommend 10/10"
5,"The closest thing to Cheers in real life. Superb beer and cocktails, very good food, and really good staff. An evergreen favourite.
Edit: 26 Nov
So many trips later it's still one of my all time favourite places.
They keep reinventing their beers and food so there's always something new to try out.
Recently Evan recommended their new Avocado Toast which is the best I've had!
Always a good time when I visit Gateway."
1,I visited today at this shop A very manner less and pathetic sales person sold me Cake with zero knowledge given wrong information abt Tht cake My guest din liked it at all she spoiled the birthday n wen I call her to say tht I have not been satisfied with the cake she spoke to me in very indiscipline way as if she is the owner of this shop With req I expected a call from the manager of this shop tht girl saying ‚Äúhamara shop band krneka tym hua hai ap kal call karna ‚Äú this wat  v getting customer service A very bad experience a very bad day coz tht Rude and arrogant sales person .. there are many brands launched bt I was the fan of Monginis lekin ab wil suggest people not to buy from Monginis coz there zero knowledge sales person with zero taste n bad customer service shop specially pratiksha nagar outlet shop the worst sales I have seen there ‚Ä¶ Zero rating from my side
4,"Cake taste is nice.. monginis is franchise based brand.. there are many outlets we'll find overall mumbai as well as in many other major cities in India.. they provide egg and eggless cakes.. also one can find snacks veg and non veg in many outlets.. cakes range are birthday party celebration cakes, customised cakes, pastries etc.. taste for all cakes are nice.."
4,"There cakes are great, but the rainbow pastry i ate today sucks, very very sugary and too much creme than cake...tasted horrible"
1,"I took a sparkle from monginis with cake it was not proper from below as the fitting of plastic was loose i informed them give me another one the lady and person at counter gave same sparkle with putting a cellotape on bottom he said now it is ok i took it,but i sparked it it burst on face"
1,"The customer services are poor and the staff don't pay much attention to the customers , speaks rudely ; there is no delivery available . Overall the experience is bad ."
5,"Yauatcha is undoubtedly a fantastic fine dining experience! The ambiance is chic and modern, perfect for a classy night out or a special occasion. The food is exceptional, with a wide variety of dim sums, desserts, and other Cantonese dishes that are beautifully presented and bursting with flavor. The service is impeccable, with attentive staff who make you feel well taken care of.

That said, it‚Äôs definitely on the pricier side, so it‚Äôs more of a treat-yourself kind of place. If you‚Äôre looking to elevate your experience, I highly recommend trying their sake‚Äîit pairs wonderfully with the food and adds an extra layer of sophistication to the meal.

Overall, Yauatcha is a must-visit for anyone who appreciates great food and a luxurious dining experience, but be prepared for a splurge!"
5,"I don‚Äôt even know where to begin with my experience at Yauatcha‚Äîit was truly exceptional. I had booked a table for 13 over the phone, and upon arrival, we were seated at a fantastic table. The restaurant itself was stunning, with an elegant ambiance that set the perfect mood for our gathering.

The service was outstanding from start to finish. From the moment we arrived, the staff went above and beyond‚Äîguiding both kids and adults to the lift with care. Mr. Hanif and Mr. Solkar provided impeccable service, ensuring that my family was comfortable and happy throughout the meal. Towards the end, Mr. Sachin personally checked in on us and even surprised us with a complimentary chocolate dessert, which was such a thoughtful gesture. (The aunty in the restroom was also super adorable)

As for the food, every dish was phenomenal. There wasn‚Äôt a single plate that disappointed. The precision and thoughtfulness behind each menu item were evident, making every bite a delight.

I‚Äôm beyond impressed with Yauatcha and will definitely be returning‚Äînot just for the beautifully presented dishes, but for the incredible service and overall experience. Highly recommended!"
5,"Yauatcha is the perfect blend of luxury and culinary excellence. The ambiance is super chic and boogie, making it ideal for a special dining experience.

The quality of the food is consistently top-notch‚Äîevery dish is bursting with flavor and beautifully presented. I've visited multiple times, and it never disappoints.

Tasty food, impeccable service, and an overall amazing experience. Absolutely worth every penny! Highly recommend for anyone who appreciates fine dining."
1,"Came here in January and utterly disgusted and disappointed with a high end restaurant chain such as this one that would pay for fake reviews.  Scroll through all the google reviews for this place by date and you will see how frequently within a short period of time there are reviews by people who have never eaten here. Someone in the management is paying to have good reviews posted for this place because Yatchua is losing ground to other new restaurants. Very disappointing. With respect for the food, I came here with a friend and the sweet corn chicken soup was terrible. Had no flavor. Dumplings were okay but having 3 pieces for each type of dumpling makes no sense when you are most likely to have either 2 or 4 people at a table. Nothing great about this place. Overhyped and they haven't taken the effort to make any improvements since the time they first opened.  I'll attach my receipt to prove that I ate here."
4,What a treat!  In Mumbai for a day and was invited to this gem. Amazing plates and equally amazing tastes from mains to desserts.  A must visit üëçüèº
1,"I had the most terrible experience at this Dominoes. I was craving for a garlic bread and was famished. I entered and waited for 5 mins after asking them multiple times to take my order
When I placed my order it was ready within minutes but they didn‚Äôt bother to call me to pick up the box.
When I finally got my food after 10 mins I sat in the car and took the first most disappointing bite of Dominoes garlic bread and cheese dip.
Both tasted stale
The bread was undercooked, so it seemed like we were eating flour
There was no butter/herbs on the top
The dough was smelling

To conclude, it was the worst experience at the most dirty dominoes"
1,"The worst pizza ever had from dominos, ordered late night and it got on the way in just few second of placing order, seems they just gaved us already made pizza and garlic bread was just a flat bread with no garlic and taste... worst ever dominoz ...all pizza where cold like weather and garlic bread was just next level....i would suggest to have only cheesy dip as it was the best from here"
1,"They didn't deliver the pizza for 1 hour and now there's nothing to claim the money back since the delivery guy didn't Mark as ordered delivered plus the pizza was all cold and messed so bad taste there's no option to call as well.
The pizza I had last time was so bad thought to give it a try. My money got wasted there's no way to get it back since the support doesn't have anything it says no orders active for registered number. That's the reason Domino's has gone down like anything."
1,"The worst pizza I ever had was from the Sion branch of Domino's. They take your order, but when you try to call them, they don't pick up the phone. After an hour, they deliver the worst pizza. This was my experience. Please do not order from this branch after 11 PM ‚Äî they will only irritate you"
1,Worst domino's branch ever..i have ordered in Swiggy in mid night..there is no response either from swiggy nor domino's.. dont order from them
5,"Food quality top notch and tasty. The staff were polite and helpful and the ambience is great in short Fab place to chill with your loved ones.
Recommended dish - nachos with salsa 10/10"
4,The food is really good here and the staff is super attentive and polite. Overall a good experience.
4,"The coffees are fairly decent. The staff are friendly, courteous, helpful. They offered us water to drink even with the power going off and knowing that they were not going to be able to sell anything."
3,Decent quiet place to hang. Not a happening place. Well priced too.
4,"Scrumptious and delirious food
Service is slow. But food undoubtedly is great and portion size is good enough to feed 2 people. Dishes are tasty and cooked well.

We tasted Corn Cheese balls, White pasta, Chocolate milkshake, Hokka Noodles and Garlic bread .
Everything is worth the price."
1,The cake Dutch truffle was so dry not at all moist and it wasn't soft as usually cakes are. Upon returning it seems they need to send it for lab testing and the results will come after 10 days. They said if lab tests are good then ilI get no refubds. Don't waste your money.
5,Very tasty cakes and verry politely guys there on this shop thank you make special my daughter's birthday üéÇüéÇüéâüéÇüéÇ Deepesh Sir

5,Tejas surve .Very polite and humble executive with a very good knowledge of every productüòä
5,The best cake and the reasonable price so any one can have that cake
5,"Paninaro at BKC The capital Corporate building is a small 10-12 seater healthy food stuff who cater to the business people and employees of several companies in this complex.

Fresh salads are good, wraps are grilled before served, choice of fresh fruit juice & yogurts. Good sandwiches that can satiate both vegetarian and non-vegetarian choosers. A good choices on the menu, but most often not in stock!

Bit expensive. Service gets slow during peak lunch hours."

5,Gre8 place and staff was very helpful
5,Best & Awesome homemade Pizza !
1,"What a letdown. We ordered two ‚Äúbestsellers‚Äù on Swiggy because we were trying this place for the first time.
1.Motichoor laddoo - So dry that they weren‚Äôt even put in a paper ramekin and they didnt break during transportation
2.Rasmalai - Tasted like Rasgullas in Milk. The Rasgullas were nice"
1,"Went all the way till gate 6 for the sweets purchase but entry to the Diamond complex was not allowed. And nowhere it was mentioned that this shop is not accessible
Also staff was kind of rude and they also said that simply order from the Swiggy but if we would want to order from Swiggy then wouldn't we have done the same without coming to the Store"
1,Very very bad‚Ä¶pathetic Resturant‚Ä¶they take order and not deliver on time‚Ä¶not receive call‚Ä¶staff also very rude‚Ä¶spoil Resturant name‚Ä¶don‚Äôt order from BKC brijwasi‚Ä¶
3,"There is no option of visiting the shop n collecting our items. We have to order it over a call n their representative will deliver it at gate no 5. Hence in store option to be reviewed by them, as entry to their store is not allowed.

Also they mostly dont deliver in vicinity even for bulk orders, which is a negative point. I have experienced this 2-3 times..

This shop is only for diamond market."
2,"Wanted to visit a Mithai shop nearby and got Brijwasi on Google search in BKC & also showing as In-store shopping & pick up.
Went all the way just to find out that since they are inside Bharat Diamond Borse hence we cannot enter inside & have to order online or they will deliver till gate.
What a waste of time & money to go all the way out there. They need to update clearly on the web stating as No in store shopping & only delivery."
4,"This restaurant is located in Mulund West. It is on the first floor of their property. It is just above their cafe so it's very easy to find.

The food menu is divided into three parts - indian, oriental and continental with vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes in all three parts. We decided to order continental.

Our order included nachos, quesadilla, farmhouse pizza, aglio olio pasta, berry blast, apple mojito and choco lava. We absolutely loved all the preparations! Everything from the starters to the drinks to the dessert was lip-smacking good! Especially loved the pasta, nachos and berry blast. Would recommend everyone to try them!

When we entered the restaurant we saw that there were plastic water bottles on every table. One suggestion would be to keep regular water jars instead of these to avoid the use of plastic and only give mineral water bottles when customers ask for them.

Brownie points to the restaurant for giving us paper straws when we specifically asked them not to give us plastic straws.

Overall a good experience!"
5,"I really love this restaurant! It is definitely my favorite place to order from when visiting Mumbai! To any European, American, or Hispanic visitors I definitely recommend dining with Sorriso! They serve a variety of authentic foods! I recommend trying the pastas, the chicken burrito, the bruschetta, and brownie dessert."
1,"After a wait of an hour and a little more, pasta was uncooked and the cheese sauce was barely sauce. If the food tastes ridiculous even when a person is hungry, there is something terribly wrong. Will warn people about it."
5,"Had the bruschetta with vegetable burger, the bruschetta was very delicious with chopped vegetables on it and also the burger was great with the patty being so delicious and I liked to have that very much..the burger was extremely delicious very much"
1,They have no clue how to make food. Had a spaghetti bolognese and it was grey to begin with and tasted absolutely disgusting
4,Food is good .... service is good... pocket friendly.... good place to go with family and friends...
1,Taste not good‚Ä¶.service are bad‚Ä¶.cheap Quality
1,"My experience here was very oily, the food I ate was little bit off taste and more oil in it and also waiter seems to be little to no good at job of customer handling"
1,"I shall ordered dam biryani bt taste are not good they are using cheep quality rice and spice.
So don't  try anyone biryani waste of money. .."
1,"One of the bad experience I have got from this restaurant. I have order the food for take away. They provided me the food. When I have open some of the quantity was less. I have call the restaurant and inform them.The person who have been packed the food he also accepted. He was pack less quantity.They told me when you are free come and collect the cash. When I reach the hotel they were talking me too rudely and not providing the cash. They are telling me to come at particular time.
The mistake was done by the restaurant and talking rudely to me and not providing the money also."
4,"Box8 provides delicious meals with some good offers which makes it pocketfriendy to everyone's budget. This outlet falls in one of the biggest corporate area of Mumbai, BKC. For corporate employees who dont carry tiffin it is best option. I had ordered murg dum biryani, chicken chunks, gulab jamun and masala lemonade from this outlet. Delivery was quick. Food was hot and fresh.
Packaging was done well.

Biryani was cooked well. Fresh boneless chicken pieces which were marinated to perfection. Spices in biryani was balanced. Raita was good as well. I loved it. Just one small thing I would like to highlight rice was little less. Otherwise it was too good and scrumptious.

Chicken chunks were delicious.

Masala lemonade sweet and tangy.

Gulab jamun- small small pieces which were too yumm to eat. Sweet end to my lunch. HAPPY tummy experience with Box8. üëç"
5,"Box 8 has made my life as easy as eating a samosa. Honestly, the food quality has suddenly gone up compared to their previous mischievous packing and food. Wasn't in the mood to cook food so ordered from the BKC branch. Apparently they do serve pizzas but it's not listed on their Zomato menu. Probably you gotta call them up and fix the pizza orders. Anyway here's some food that I ate last night.

Dal Makhani Meal - 2 parathas, jeera rice, very well made dal makhani some chole, salad and a mini brownie. Thats the box. Sorted for one person. Loved the taste and the packing.

Paneer Tikka Sandwich - Ah, this juicy delicious sandwich was well made. Soft Paneer pieces with their inhouse tikka curry with onions. Loved it.

Mediterranean Pizza - Lots of mushrooms, baby corn, olives and onions made this thin crust pizza quite beautiful in look wise as well as in the taste. Found the pizza sauce a little salty. Probably that part should be worked on. Otherwise the pizza is huge in size and I love thin crust pizzas.

Chicken xxl wrap - Paratha loaded with lots of chicken and chicken and chicken with some onions and masala. This is a perfect item for on the go.

So all this food was delivered on time as well. Box 8 has changed a lot in the menu and the packing. Loving the new vibe.

Food - 4/5
Hygiene - 4/5
VFM - 3.5/5

Some pics. Namaste."
3,"I ordered a BOX8 meal for the first time and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed.
Ordered a Chicken Xtreme Box and a customized box.
The customized box consisted of rice, chicken seekh,chole,salad,chicken gravy and bite size gulab jamun. I felt this box was pretty average.
The Xtreme box to my surprise was delicious.
It had rice with chicken tikka and chicken kebab in makhni curry served with olives, salad, mint chutney and garlic yogurt.
Definitely worth every penny.
Also I ordered a fusion sandwich with chocolate brownie (not pictured)
The sandwich was not stuffed enough but it tasted great. Brownie was a total winner.
I totally recommend this place when you don‚Äôt feel like cooking or for a gloomy day. üòÅ"
4,"So i heard about this place and wanted to try, the place has some really good quality food items and worth a try. So I ordered the following food :

1.Chicken XXL wrap:who doesn't love having chicken in a wrap, this is turn was wrapped in a desi paratha, a unique but amazingly delicious food. Personally recommended.

2.Chicken triple decker sandwich:this was indeed the best food there. The chicken slices with veggies piled into organic bread was too tasty and yumm. Personally recommended.

3.Chicken overload meal:this was a wholesome meal consisting of paratha, rice, dal mahkani, brownie and chicken curry. An amazing desi food in a whole platter.

4.sekh kebab wrap : kebab over wraps, strange!! But a nostalgic and intriguing treat to my tummy.
Loved its taste and were totally worth it.

5.choco lava cake:ending my meal with this beauty was totally good. The sweetness and the chocolate sauce was too good to be true.

Overall i had a lot of joy eating these foods and would totally order some more in near future"
4,"A great option for ordering food online, especially for lunch if you're in office. They have modified their menu completely with a lot of customized options now keeping the working class in mind. Few more additions in the menu would be great. The only challenge they need to tackle is the delivery delays one normally faces with them."
1,Not at all good food. First it was my favourite place but not it is the worst place i ever visited ü§Æü§Æü§Æ. The quality of the food is also not good Steel scrubber pieces ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ were there in my soup and when i complaint about it they told me it is not a big deal it happens how can they do this as it is not good for anyone's healthüò°ü§¨.
1,Poor quality food  can't visit again
2,üôÑ
4,Good
5,Good
5,"Easily one of the most accommodating restaurants I have ever been to.
I'm sure it's frustrating for chefs to have to deal with dinners with a gazillion dietary restrictions. But Chef Sanika was in her element! She patiently understood everything we could and couldn't eat, and then suggested a menu that hit the perfect spot. She even adjusted some of the ""Do Not Skip This"" dishes to our needs.
Top this off with one of the most scrumptious deserts I have ever tasted (only a genius can make desert taste good when it needs to be  gluten and dairy free!)

Thank you dear staff of Botticino for a lovely and memorable dining experience."
4,"The menu at the restaurant has changed, with mango specials available right now. The mango mule was delicious‚Ä¶ recommended if vodka is your preferred drink. The portions sizes are smaller than at Celini (Grand Hyatt) or Romano‚Äôs (Marriott), but the quality of food is great. We were celebrating a friends birthday and they sweetly provided a red velvet cake complimentary."
5,Food is absolutely delicious and authentic. Very pleasant and courteous staff especially Nancy who attended to us for the evening. Overall a fantastic experience. Tiramisu is a must try.
4,"Went for dinner to this 15 years old restaurant...was impressed....menu was re done...excellent options.
Service was aaa plus. Food was good....not great..prawns came a bit under done..
It's recommended..
Nice place for a meal...

A great discovery - Spring onion, Oriental cuisine restaurant in Shivaji park, Dadar, Mumbai
Have branches in Pune City also.

It's a home delivery and take away outlet.
The passion of serving good oriental cuisine, of an ex Ranji trophy player is an unique combination

The passion of the owner, shows into the deep understanding of foodies' choices. The way Indians enjoy their food.
I love spicy food, I must say, the food is just - my kind of food.

Spring onion is established in 2012
It's almost a decade now
The popularity of this place is increasing day by day
""No Aji No Motto"" is the Group's motto
It really made me a big fan of this group
I would love my food fresh tasty and without any harmful chemicals.

Lots of options in menu for vegetarian and non-vegetarian foodies.

Placed our Weekend lunch order online for -

Prawns mustard peri dry - Must try this dish. One of the delicious prawn starter dish indeed.

Paneer Orange celery dry - Loved this sweet and sour taste of this dish.

For main course -
Chicken cilantro pepper rice - A great creation, I must say. Loved the fresh green natural herbs colour and taste of this rice dish.

Prawn Nariman Point noodles - I have loved it. Right kind of noodles for us. Fine noodles are used.

Chicken in Hakka sauce - A great curry dish, good about of boneless chicken pieces are added in the hakka sauce curry.

Prawns in red Thai curry - it's served with steamed rice. A great combo meal. Thick coconut milk based Thai red curry gravy with good amount of prawns. My real comfort food.

4,"I have been to this restaurant and had so many dishes that I Don't even remember them all. Dishes worth ordering are chicken chicken chilly dry, burnt coriander chicken, hot garlic gravy, coriander pot noodles. Do not order garlic Coriander pot rice at all. It is bland."
4,"I have been couple of times to Spring Onions and I totally love it's authentic oriental cuisine. It is situated right on King's Circle Maheshwari Udyan next to Kooolar restaurant but on the main road towards Dadar side. The seating is slightly congested mostly because of the small space the restaurant operates from. However their menu & the fast service more than makes up for it. Their motto - no Ajinomoto( taste enhancers), which I think is quite true they do not add any ajinomoto to any of their dishes. Despite the missing taste enhancers the food tastes very authentic & yummy. I doubt you will find anything as good in anywhere nearby & quality is very good as well. The quantity I personally feel is on higher side for an individual & slightly lesser for a couple. For a 2-3 people you can fill yourself up decently with 2 starters & 3 main course & it won't cost you more than ‚Çπ300-400 per person. But don't worry too the friendly staff will guide you. They also pack your leftover of you like to take them home. Overall a very nice place for a quiet dinner for a couple or a small group."
4,"A very nice restaurant outlet at King Circle . It's a small place which can accommodate only 20 guests, I suggest they must soon find a bigger place as they are really good at what they offer in the menu. It's very delicious . The best for my taste buds were burnt garlic rice. Have tried Peri Peri paneer, pot rice, speggati,chilly coriander noodles & many more. All were really good to taste."
1,Worst food delivered. Ordered through swiggy. Aloo schezwan kulcha was yuck and lachha parathas name should be rubber paratha it was not at all lachha. Dal makhani had only makhani and no dal at all. Earlier they use to make wheat based parathas. For some reason they started using maida that too very very soggy parathas. Dont order even if this is the last option in the world. I just hate the food. 0 star.
3,"A good option for Vegetarians. Food is Ok. Parathas could be better if they use fresh potato base rather than frozen base.
Menu offering is value for money."
4,"Excellent Punjabi vegetarian food. The seating area is not very good, but the food totally makes up for it. They seem to be geared towards home delivery."
1,Paratha were very bad in taste and also stuffing was very less and it was made on tandoor.
1,Very bad experience. paratha is like papad and it takes more than one hour to deliver food within one and half kilometre distance.im not giving even Singal star for this.
5,"We had an exceptional dining experience at CraftsBar in BKC! The menu offered a delightful fusion of flavors, and we thoroughly enjoyed our selections. The pasta was cooked to perfection, the pizza crust was crispy and flavorful, and the dessert was a sweet indulgence. The Color Mocktail was a refreshing surprise, complementing our meal beautifully. The ambiance was vibrant and modern, with excellent service to top it off"
5,"Craftbar is located off BKC in Bandra East and it is accurately available on Google Maps hence easy to find. Their other outlet is in Andheri East.

The restaurant is spacious with nice sound system, a projector screen, a finely lit bar and multiple seatings for all type of groups. They have not invested much in the ambiance however the feel is nice.

They specialise in a multi cuisine menu and the options are great. Dishes are nicely balanced for both vegetarians and non vegetarians. Prices are at par with similar type of brands amd the best part is the offers on drinks. On a daily basis they have kept different offers so do check those before visiting.

I went here for dinner and the kitchen service was quick and the table service by staff Jeevan was good.

What We Had -
APPETIZERS~
Kashmiri Paneer Tikka -
Fresh paneer with coriander and green base tasted decent. The spice rub lacked the zing and I felt less time was given to tandoor. Hence minor improvements needed.

Devil's Chicken Chilli -
Looked fiery but tasted great. Juicy chiken chunks with bell peppers and onions with garlic and red chilli base tasted delicious. Loved the bold flavours which were not too strong.

Butter Garlic Prawns -
One word perfect. Fresh prawns with bell peppers and onions and base as butter garlic tasted outstanding. Loved the juicy prawns and the butter didn't left any sweet after taste plus flavours from the garlic was spot on.

MAINS~
Desi Style Triple Rice (Chicken)-
A perfect craving buster for a Chinese lover like me. Loved the rice, gravy and the egg on the top. Deliciously tasty as everything about this dish was amazing.

DESSERTS~
English Vinglish -
A fusion of chocolate brownie with gajar ka halwa. Looked stunning tasted great. Loved eating every bit of this.

MOCKTAILS~
Fruit Punch.
Citrus Cooler.
Both the mocktails were refreshing with perfect flavours.

So our dinner at Craftbar BKC was a great meal as everything from food, service to music was amazing. Therefore a must visit but do check their offers."
5,"Craftbar BKC delivers an exceptional dining experience, deserving a solid 5-star review. The ambiance is vibrant yet cozy, setting the perfect tone for a memorable meal. Starting with the Egg Kejriwal, the dish was a delightful fusion of flavors, offering a gourmet twist on a comfort food favorite. The Beetroot Tikki was a standout, with its earthy flavors beautifully complemented by just the right amount of spice.

The Devil‚Äôs Chicken Chilli lived up to its name, delivering a fiery kick that left us craving more. Chicken Kulfi was a surprising highlight, with tender, juicy chicken infused with aromatic spices, creating a dish that melted in the mouth. Finally, the English Winglish dessert was the perfect end to the meal‚Äîa sweet, indulgent treat that balanced the savory dishes perfectly. Each dish was presented with care, and the flavors were spot on, making Craftbar BKC a must-visit for any food lover."
5,"Recently visited Carft bar at BKC and i must say that the my experience in both term of ambiance and food quality was better. They have multiple activities. They have also Wednesday night for only girls/ladies. There have lovely atmosphere and varities of food foods and ambience of music make your perfect memorable moments.
Drink:- (5/5)Ordered one mocktail fruit punch and ine cocktail lit. Superb in taste.
Starter:- (5/5) They varities of starter and i ordered chicken crispy and loaded nachos. Delicious in taste and Good presentation.
Food (4/5) :- butter naan and butter chicken.
They served well. The food were looking too good. Delicious in taste and i will prefer you.
Dessert :- They have varieties of dessert. And i guarantee you love to eat.
Overall service were good, ambiance in nature and Good for memorable moments."
5,"I recently dined at *Craftbar* that impressed me with its innovative dishes and inviting atmosphere. The Egg Kejriwal was a delightful starter, with a half-cooked omelette and rich mushroom stuffing on pav. The Gochujang Chicken Kulfi offered a unique blend of tangy, spicy flavors on a tender tangadi. The Tavuk Istanbul Biryani, served in bamboo, was aromatic and flavorful, with perfectly cooked rice and paneer. The English Vinglish dessert was nice with stuffed gajar halwa, a great way to end the meal. The warm ambience made the experience even more enjoyable."
4,Really good parathas are served here. Their taste is quite unique. Prices are a bit high but are worth once. They have a small sitting area with good ambience. Their kitchen is behind the main outlet. No washbasin and washroom is available. They provide you with lemon and hot water in bowl to wash hands. The good part is that there is no service charge on the final bill.
5,"üî∞ Only Parathas is one of the best Dining to try for all the Paratha Lovers out there. Only Parathas in Bandra (e) is a small tiny outlet serving the best Paratha's.

üî∞Food was very well cooked and delicious also the staff was very kind and hardworking.

üî∞Had this spicy Lazeez paratha with rose lassi and would surely recommend Biryani.

3,"The rates are exaggerated. Menu shown for takeaway and they charged differently more for dine in.  Taste was just ok though served in fullplate with daal, chhole and raita."
1,The parathas were fried in oil. I mean really who fries parathas in oil üôÑüôÑ. They were all dark brown in color like a puri. I had to throw them away. Very very angry üò°.
5,"Tasty and yummy parathas are special to be tried here. Nawabi paratha and Cheese garlic paratha are best which I had. Paratha comes along with raita, chole and makhani dal. Best place for veg lover's."
4,"Visited here for a buffet and got a good deal from Zomato carnival! We opted for a vegetarian buffet and the spread they have for vegetarian dishes is insane!! Right from asian where they have variety of rice, noodles and gravy along with sushi and soups is just commendable! They have live counters where you can enjoy variety of  chaats and a dosa counter where they even serve healthy moong dal dosa and a lot more!
The salad counter and the North Indian cuisine is again a delight‚ù§Ô∏è
Ending the buffet on a sweet note with their variety of dessert and our favorites were the nutella cheesecake and baked yoghurtüòãüòã
They have inhouse icecreams as well and blueberry is a must try‚ù§Ô∏è
The ambience was amazing with a view of western express highway and staff members were generous enough to serve us and be present whenever needed.

Overall a great experience and would definitely recommend on giving it a try!"
5,"It's a fantastic restaurant in Mumbai known for its delightful ambience and delicious food. The restaurant offers a wide variety of dishes, with a focus on seasonal ingredients. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, making it a great place to enjoy a meal with friends or family. I highly recommend trying their signature dishes like the seasonal salads and the chef's special desserts."
2,"The starters were the only decent part; everything else fell flat. The main course was mediocre, the plates and spoons were filthy, and the service was abysmal. To top it off, the fruit juice was watered down, and I discovered a fly swimming in it. Adding insult to injury, the chef's attitude remained unapologetic even after finding a fly in the juice. Her excuse, ""this is an open restaurant,"" is utterly unacceptable for a Westin, let alone a supposed five-star establishment. They need to step up their game, pronto."
3,"At dinner, it was pretty packed venue.
Understaffed.
Hospitality or table service was very very poor or absent.
Quality of starters was ok,
Chaat counter was ok.
But actual Indian dining section was a great  disappointment.
Very very spicy meal.
Even Breads were served so late.
Seating was not comfortable.
Service poor."
5,The breakfast buffet was indeed a feast. Both veg and non veg options were catered with care. Debalina was hospitable! The entire staff was courteous and helpful. And the chef absolutely rocks! Definitely going again soon!
5,"We had just starters

As we were on a no carbs diet.

They catered and recommended as per our specifications

Quite reasonable prices too"
5,Food was awesome and the staff were really kind.. you will find a nice atmosphere if you are looking for a couple date
5,"Good Restaurant with Good Food .
Nice ambience and Good staff .
Love eating over here ."
5,"We are from Delhi. Today, we got a chance to have Dinner at your Hotel. We relished every bit of the Food served here and the service too. We are also overwhelmed by the courtesy provided by the serving staff & all. Please maintain this. We wish you good luck for you all.

5,Great food. Great service. Food comes pretty quick and tastes delectable. Must try the Chicken Tikka Kulshen. Amazing atmosphere. Good music.
4,"Subway ‚Äì Oberoi Mall, Goregaon

We stopped by Subway in the Oberoi Mall food court for a lighter, healthier bite and opted for a customized salad with paneer, topped with honey mustard and chilli dressing. The experience was fresh, quick, and satisfying.

The staff at this outlet were polite and efficient. They took time to ask for preferences on veggies, dressings, and spice levels ‚Äì which is always a plus at Subway. Everything looked fresh and well-stocked behind the counter.

The paneer was soft and mildly spiced, grilled just right. It added a good amount of protein and texture to the salad. We chose a mix of fresh veggies ‚Äì lettuce, onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, and olives ‚Äì and they all tasted crisp and clean.

The real winner, though, was the combination of honey mustard and chilli dressing. It gave the salad a balanced flavor ‚Äì sweet and tangy with just the right kick of heat. It elevated the whole bowl and made it far more enjoyable than your average salad.

Portion size was generous, making it a good value for money, especially if you‚Äôre looking for something healthy in a food court full of heavier options.

Overall, this Subway outlet delivers on freshness and flavor. One star off just because the seating in the food court can be a bit hectic, and the presentation could be improved slightly. But for a quick, clean, and customizable meal, it‚Äôs definitely worth trying."
2,The main guy at the checkout counter really needs to improve his customer service. Please be aware of little things while serving customers.
1,"Worst subway restaurant, they made a joke out of the Zomato delivery.

I had order veggie delight and what I received is some quantity of veggies and half baked.

Highly not recommended!"
3,"‚ÄúI recently visited the Subway shop at oberoi and unfortunately had a disappointing experience. The staff were quite rough and rude, which made my visit uncomfortable. Additionally, the quantity of the food provided did not seem to match the price I paid. Overall, the service was very poor, and I would hope for improvements in both staff behavior and value for money in the future.‚Äù"
1,"Though I have purchased meatball with dip, there is no dip in the parcel, and they call these meatballs, absolutely salty no taste and stale."
5,The ambience was peaceful. Staffs were kind and generous. They provided best service for us and shared some recommendations on order with us. Over all had a great experience.
1,"""I recently visited McDonald's and had a really unpleasant experience. I ordered a Coke with no ice, but when I received it, it was full of ice. To make things worse, I found an insect in my drink. This was absolutely disgusting, and I‚Äôm really disappointed with the service and hygiene standards. I expected better from such a well-known chain. I won‚Äôt be returning after this experience."""
3,Took their veg combo. Latte was nice. Hash Brown was same as aloo tikki of irctc that they put in bun. Burger had very less cheese and sauces. Staff was nice. They have created quite an ambience here in this okayish mall.
5,"I accidentally spilled my coffee on the table today while having a meal. The staff swiftly cleaned it up and provided me with some tissues. They even brought me a fresh cup of coffee for free, even though I didn‚Äôt ask for it! Some coffee had spilled onto my burger meal, and they kindly replaced it with a new one as well. I‚Äôm truly thankful and happy to see such polite and helpful staff. üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I would definitely visit this place again!"
1,"Staff are very arrogant, rude & very disgusting. Each lady was non approachable, no Staff had a decency to smile as well. They need to learn that we come here for food and they need to behave well as it's their job. If they don't have atleast basic manner do smile and do their job then just sit at home.
Disgusting Staff!!!!"
5,"I recently visited this restaurant and had a good experience. I tried the Cheese Sandwich and Pizza, both of which were delicious. The cheese sandwich was perfectly toasted with a generous amount of cheese, while the pizza had a crispy base and flavorful toppings.

One unique aspect of this place is its first pay and token system, which makes ordering quick and efficient. Another plus is their long operating hours‚Äîthe restaurant is open from 7:30 AM to 1:30 AM, making it a convenient spot for both early breakfasts and late-night cravings."
5,"I love this place every time I want to eat vegetarian food or yummy snacks. This time we celebrated our birthday here with some scrumptious meals with wonderful service by their staff.
They are a well trained team to serve customers in such an organised manner. I highly recommend this place for quick bytes to fine dine. You can even grab some dry snacks and cakes for your special days ."
2,"The concept of serving unlimited pasta and pizzas during a particular time is great. However, they are damn slow in their service. You will get bored waiting and lose your appetite.  Also, their pizza was not great. I loved the white sauce pasta they served the first time. But when I asked for it again as the veg pizza was not good, they forgot about it and later said they had lready given it to be 15 mins back. And so I had to wait more for it to be prepared and served to me.

I really felt I should have bought from dominos instead."
4,"Located near Goregaon railway station, this eatery is a convenient spot for a quick bite. The place is clean and well-maintained, with comfortable seating for patrons. While the service may not be lightning-fast, the menu offers a diverse range of North Indian, South Indian, and fast food dishes to satisfy your cravings."
3,"I had the Rasam Wada, the quantity was too little for the price. However the taste was adequate probably as it is deep fried in oil.
I would recommend the veg Schezwan noodle frankey. That was just YUMüòã"
1,"I ordered two pizzas from Domino‚Äôs (Order No: 114) ‚Äî one of them being a medium size Spicy Double Chicken pizza. Unfortunately, the experience was very disappointing. The crust of the chicken pizza was burnt, as clearly visible in the pictures, and it had a bitter, charred taste. The overall flavor was way off ‚Äî the chicken pieces were dry and lacked seasoning, and the pizza felt overcooked.

For the price I paid (‚Çπ794.85), I expected much better quality. This definitely wasn‚Äôt up to Domino‚Äôs usual standards. Hope the quality control improves because this was not worth it at all."
1,"""I am writing to express my extreme disappointment with the Domino's franchise located at Malad East, Upper Govind Nagar. This was my 3rd visit at this particular domino‚Äôs outlet, I was appalled by the unprofessional behavior of the staff, including the lady at the counter who seemed uninformed about basic customer service skills. The loud and unprofessional chit-chat among staff members in the kitchen, replete with objectionable language, created a disturbing ambiance reminiscent of a fish market. Furthermore, the air conditioning was not functioning properly, adding to the overall discomfort. I was also solicited to provide fake reviews, which I found highly unprofessional. I strongly believe that if this franchise continues to operate with such a poorly trained staff, it will inevitably lose customers and damage the Domino's brand reputation."
1,"Never place order from here. They will accept your order and won‚Äôt pick your calls. Min. Delivery time will be 2-3 hours.
The behaviour is very rude of staff.
Where dominos is giving 30 min. Delivery guarantee and this outlet is giving 30 min. Non delivery guarantee."
2,"A huge sham! If you order for a pizza from Malad East on their app,this is where the order is prepared. I have had countless pizzas from here and the experience is always disappointing.
My regular order is either indie tandoori/cheeze volcano pizza with garlic bread,and the taste is substandard. The base of indi tandoori is hard as stone and the cheeze at the centre of the volcano pizza dries off 15m after opening the box and the garlic bread has no seasoning. The worst part?They never deliver on time!!I don't remember anytime they have fulfilled the 'Dominoes 30m delivery promise ' and I usually let go of it but last time that I ordered,it had been 26minutes since the order was placed and the order was still being baked and the outlet is 10mins away from my place so I raised a ticket on the app stating order is late,which led to a resolution within the app that I'd receive 300 rs in my dominoes wallet as compensation.The next thing I know I get a call from the manager of this outlet who tells me straight up ""THERE ARE 4MINS STILL REMAINING WHY DID YOU RAISE A TICKET THAT ORDER IS LATE?""I explained to him the math of how in no way is the delivery going to happen in 4mins to which he got mad at me and raised his voice and said ""SO WHAT WHY DID YOU DO IT PREMATURELY CAN'T YOU WAIT UNTIL ITS 30M""He was rude and I told him I'll return the 300 if it will make him happy to which he curtly replied ""UGH IVE ALREADY ADDED 300 TO YOUR WALLET NO NEED "".This was the first time that I had taken advantage of their own company policy and in return I was being schooled by this rude person;if y'all have such problems with fair compensation maybe expedite the service while also sticking to Dominoes standards."
1,"no response for calls, delayed order and no confirmation at all ... and even if it gets delivered, it will be cold as ice , worthy enough to go right in trash...  worst experience ever

at this rate just close up this store"
1,Worst coffee I got here. I have order 2 cappuccino but I got 1 cappuccino with no latte art and another was wrost not even cappuccino its completely flat white and I can't even feel coffee flavour in that and I ask him can I try pouring milk he was saying its not our company policy and so I want to ask you MacDonald what company policy there is no latte art on coffee not type of coffee I order so please train the staff for good quality as we are expensing on coffee in your outlet it should be upto the mark
4,"Title: A Fantastic Experience at McDonald's - Delicious Burgers and Great Value for Money!

Review:

I had the pleasure of visiting McDonald's today, and I must say it was an absolute delight. From the moment I stepped in, the friendly and welcoming atmosphere made me feel right at home. I couldn't wait to indulge in their renowned burgers and fries, and I was not disappointed.

The highlight of my visit was undoubtedly the burger. The quality of the patty, combined with the fresh ingredients and perfectly toasted bun, created a truly mouthwatering experience. Each bite was bursting with flavor, leaving me craving for more. It's evident that McDonald's takes pride in crafting their burgers with great care and attention to detail.

The accompanying French fries were equally impressive. They were golden, crispy, and served piping hot, exactly how I like them. The fries were seasoned to perfection, striking a perfect balance between saltiness and tastiness. They complemented the burger beautifully and added an extra level of satisfaction to my meal.

What pleasantly surprised me was the affordability of the meal. McDonald's has always been known for providing great value for money, and this visit was no exception. The cost of the burger and fries was reasonable, considering the quality and taste they delivered. It's refreshing to find a fast-food chain that not only satisfies my taste buds but also my budget.

The service at McDonald's was excellent. The staff members were attentive, efficient, and had a genuine desire to ensure that customers had a pleasant experience. The cleanliness of the restaurant was also noteworthy, creating a hygienic and comfortable environment for dining.

In conclusion, my visit to McDonald's today was exceptional. The delicious burger, delightful French fries, reasonable pricing, and outstanding service all contributed to a memorable experience. I highly recommend McDonald's to anyone in search of a satisfying and enjoyable fast-food meal. Whether you're a fan of their classic offerings or looking to try something new from their menu, you're bound to find something that will satisfy your cravings at McDonald's."
1,"Ordered a combo meal which included a burger softdrinks  and fries 499 for two burgers .
Was told that there would be no softdrinks as the machine was broken and that I would have to pay extra for the drink.
This is absolutely ridiculous.
Why do you advertise combo meals than
I refused to pay extra and walked away and miraculously the staff came out of the counter and informed me that the soft drink  machine was now working.
Absolutely horrible experience not expecting this from a global MacDonald chain"
1,Its been 2 years since I have been ordering one of their gourmet burger which cheesyburger in which the patty is loaded with cheese except this time. The patty was hollow from inside. I could sense that the patty was not fresh and overcooked due to which the cheese inside is no longer melting also it tastes weird. Its one of their premium burgers but doesnt worth the price. I would rather go for mc veggie next time instead of their gourmet burgers.
5,This spot is wonderful to visit. You have a theater nearby. well if you are a fan of MCD interior then this might not suit you. But the service makes up for it it's fast and robust. Not a great spot for a date but perfect for gathering.
4,"Tatus Nook has a decent ambiance with a spacious setup, giving a fine dining feel. However, the food was not as flavorful as expected. While the service was efficient, it felt more like a regular fast-paced restaurant. Pricing is nominal, and the portion sizes are adequate. Overall, a good experience but has room for improvement."
1,"I have ordered chicken triple noodles
Very bad teast
I don't like
I suggest not going to tatos
Waste of money
Is acha to raste ka chinese hai"
5,Good decent Chinese restaurant. Mid level. Not a high end. But standard good tasting Chinese and Thai place. I had the chilli paneer gravy and Singaporean fried rice which was delicious.
5,"I have been visiting this place my child hood..
Its almost more that 25 years old place.
The food the ambience the vibe of this place is best.
Whenever we cost it feels like we have been coming for the fisrt time.
Feels. Like home.
Highly recommended for non veg lovers."
4,"Good ambience, professional and courteous staff are some of the obvious stars on the shoulder for this establishment.
We had the opportunity to have dinner at this place. We ordered Wonton soup, Singaporean noodles, dragon spring rolls and veg 65 spicy Manchurian balls. Couple of them were the suggestions of the Waiter and he was patient enough to explain all our questions regarding the dishes and what they were made of, the spiciness and taste etc.
The food was delicious and the portion sizes were decent enough for 2, although we shared it among 3 of us, it was still filling.

All this at a very budget friendly cost. They also serve drinks I presume as we did see a bar section, but not sure if that was open. There is an AC hall and an outside seating area.
The only thing that was off is that 2 tables are placed on a platform and it has a set stairs leading to it, but there is no demarcation of the curved platform which might cause guests to fall off if they weren't looking down while getting up from the table.
Rest is all good."
2,"Lovely ambience this is the 2nd time we visited but the taste gone down bit away from the previous one experience, could do better and also the Maitre D could be more welcoming rather than being biased no smile no welcoming, I hope I would not like to see him as a Maitre D in Kangan next time time to change some here and there stuff Kangan guess the quality is getting low ."
4,Kangan is always a delight to dine. The service is great! The food is amazing‚Ä¶I feel they need to work a bit on the ambience..must order their kebabs and dal Kangan. The choice of Indian breads is also vast. Do try the cheese garlic naan and the butter Rumali roti
5,We celebrated our wedding anniversary in the best way thanks to Kangan. Amazing food with great options to choose from. We opted for the set menu and were blown away by the flavour packed in the food. Was such a great experience enjoying fine dining
5,"Kangan offers a delightful dining experience.  The food was well-prepared and flavorful, exceeding expectations.  The restaurant's ambiance is very pleasant and creates a relaxing atmosphere.  Service was attentive and efficient.  I highly recommend Kangan for a special meal."
5,"A wonderful experience at Kangan. Exemplary service, wonderful food, and amazing views.
Harsh was awesome in his service and so was the chef Farrukh. The food was delicious and well prepared and presented. Highly recommended!"
2,"This restaurant was renamed as Pritam veg restaurant a long time back. To be honest, located on the main Dindoshi road, next to Dindoshi bus depot, this restaurant is perfect for only those who are waiting to catch a bus from the depot and can't go anywhere else. otherwise it's not for a family /friends to go for a proper dining.

Food quality is bad. We ordered idli Vada combo, masala dosa, paav bhaji. The sambar was sweet, tasted old and burnt. Something like boiled multiple times and hence the result. There are many other veg restaurants around, so if you have time, visit some other, not this one.
The waiters and the support staff are courteous though.
The location is the only plus point about it."
5,Unique and tasty dishes for all time perfact place for having lunch or dinner good service and nice üíØ
3,Food is good but quantity is very much less than price which they charged.. staff is not customer friendly
5,Food was amazing. Service is very quick and flawless. Great vegetarian options are available in multiple cuisines.
5,"This restaurant has been long renamed to Pritam veg restaurant. Pritam restaurant supposedly serves the best in quality food in the whole of Goregaon east. We have a lot of other fancy veg restaurants around, but none can match the taste of their food and their hospitality is inequalled. The waiters and the support staff are very cordial and courteous. In terms of the ambience and location they probably fall short to their competitors."
5,"As a 90s kid,this shop has always held a very special place in my heart as every birthday celebration meant a Monginis cake would be brought from here. What is amusing is that the quality and service has stood the test of time. All the bakery products are fresh and yummy and even though the service staff has changed over the years,they always serve with a smile and are a welcoming bunch.Poojari Uncle who used to run the place before and sadly has tragically passed away,used to always make it a point to speak to me as a young kid and so did the other staff. The other branches across Bombay aren't as great as this one and the pineapple cake and pastry still are as flavourful as before."
5,Fresh cake. Staff little lazy. All type of cake available. Now it‚Äôs opposite Washington plaza
3,"I ordered Chicken patties and it was good . Nice and moist and hot, however the truffle pastry was extremly dry looked like a stale piece was served to me . Feedback was given to the staff seems less interested just said it just arrived today."
1,Nothing to my surprise this time also your branch disappointed me..I agree that I went at 11:35 pm but if your shop is closed why were the shutter not half down? Secondly everytime I come across your staff who don't know how to treat customers. After putting my lava cake in oven she(staff) told me that I have to pay offline in case  and after offering her 500rs she asked me for change which I didn't have so she asked me to go back and didn't bother. Plz train your staff
5,Good service all stock fresh my favourite cake shop thanks you so much Monginis
5,I like this place for gaming.
4,Good
5,Wonderful

4,"Neat, clean, hygienic, well groomed & uniformed staff. Comfortable seating. Staff is courteous and helpful as well,
Must try South Indian dishes papdi chat, tried panjabi thali also it‚Äôs also the mark
No parking available. Nearest parking is BMC parking lot in next building but it is an expensive affair."
1,This restaurant is very bad and I had the worst experience over here. We ordered a Tava Pulav and we got a Cockroach in the. Please don't ever go to this restaurant please see the picture of food.
5,"Amazing fingerlicking food
Quality superb
Quick service
Never disappointed  with the food
And very welcoming staff n give proper attention
Must visit if you near at goregoan east"
5,"Last day we had visited this restaurant for our team lunch. People say when food is served with love it goes directly to your heart and gives you happiness, thats kind of sweet behaviour the staff does over Balaji restaurant. Amazing service with so much of politeness and speed. The taste is beyond imagination. The service is really commendable. I kind of believe in appreciation so I directly told the staff that their service is so good and I could really see the happiness on his face. Strongly recommend to visit this place.
Also the super special thing is the pan served by them in the end"
5,Nice Ambience of The Coffee shop. Good for quiet meetings. Nice fare on offer incl Buffet Dinner. Latte Tea is my favourite.
4,Sober and quite place. Serves booze till 1 am. Selectively Good a-la-carte food.
4,Good place and good service but very quiet coz very few people go there.
4,Nice place.All brands of beverages available.nice service and ambience.
3,Food not up to the expectation. Could have been better.
1,Who doesn't care about the taste of food they can order from this place. Useless. See the quality of chicken lollypop. We have to throw this.
5,"Experience was good. Had chicken tikka and tandoori prawns. I must say it was really tasty. Proper blend of ingredients and tasted really well. I had to wait for 15-20 minutes but it was worth it. Best place for friends to hangout and people who want to enjoy good food can consider this place. Not to forget, it's pocket friendly so my dear college friends can also enjoy."
5,Magnum Delhi Family Restaurant and Bar is very nice and cool place for having drinks. Staff is cooperative and extended their fast services.
4,"Good place to have nice food and drink on S V Road, Goregone. Food is testy and quantity also responsiblely okay. Staff is cooprative.
It's value for money."
4,"The food is awesome. It has a unique taste. The sesmic chilli, prawns harimirch, pepper chicken, the sunny side up double egg.. are my favourites and stands out.  Other dishes are kori roti, bhatkal biryani which also have a great taste... The best part is that they don't use any artificial colours."
2,"Just fine, A local shop majorly catering to Chinese and Pizza items, not very tasty though !!"
5,I tried  their fried rice and pasta. It was superb.
4,Nice pizza but waiting time is more...
4,Good food better than office canteen.
5,Decent pricing and good options
5,"Visited on a weekday, and despite that, there were a lot of people coming in constantly. I ordered the chicken lollipop and received 8 pieces - definitely worth the price. I also tried the chicken Malaysian noodles, which were very light and soulful, with plenty of chicken and egg. The staff was excellent - very attentive and followed our instructions perfectly, especially when we requested not to add too many vegetables to the noodles. The noodles and chicken could use a bit more seasoning, but with a touch of dark soy sauce, they tasted great. Overall, a good ambience and a pleasant place to dine!"
3,"The food quality is good, tastes also good but they take a lot of  time to serve like we order 2 murg mussalum exactly at 11 pm and they serve us at almost 11:45. For just glasses we have to tell the server so many times.
The bill for 10 people was 11k was moderate as a resto and bar.
And lastly they don't  hear you even after calling several times."
4,"It  was my Frist visit to this restaurant on S.V. Road. I have been seeing it for many years but yesterday I went for lunch there.First went to the restaurant, and asked them to suggest a starter they told to try  pepper chicken  blast and it was really  delicious  The preparation of the foods and presentation was also looking tempting so we ordered Chinese one pot meal chicken it was sufficient for two
Overall a place for comfort dinning"
4,"Lovely lunch experience at this place. Dining place is very spacious. A large team can have enough seating. üëçThe staff is quite attentive and well behaved .

Tried chicken tandoori , was luscious chicken. Chicken bhoona masala  and roti is recommended."
3,"The food was good with decent rates.but they were charging Rs 60 for Rs 20 bottle of water. When asked - they said that they have written Rs 60 in the menu itself,so according to this because they have written Rs 60 they can charge Rs 60. This way,they might write any price on the menu and charge whatever they feel."
5,"The shop looks very clean and hygienic. Also, the food and ingredients are very well organized and stored.

This joint seems to be a must-try for local Bombay Chaat like Sev Puri, Bhel Puri and Pani Puri.

The place appears to be recently opened and is very brightly lit."

Idli Sambar, 40/ 100 and Coffee 20/100( The score).

Please don't cheat customers. That will certainly boomerang!

2,Place is nice and Clean .. but the food is not that good and also the service is not that satisfactory..used to come here because of nice service and taste .. but now they have changed everything and the taste is also ruined ..they must do something about the food
5,If you are a fan of Malvani food and taste their food is exactly what your tastebuds want. The shellfish and other all fry fish and gravy are what I have tasted and it's awesome.. s must try resturant food. The resturant is pretty small so parcel is the best option !!
5,"good food authentic maharashtrian food especially in the sea food ,pocket friendly price"
2,"First of all, owner was dealing with personal issue with loud voice in this small hotel when we entered this hotel.  There was no care about customers. People go to hotel for peaceful eating but owner was least bothered. This was first sad part. Secondly Fish was not fresh we tried to convince but he was in different mood. Sol Cuddi was having different flavour, though his staff saying it is fresh but owner agreed to it later.  This is going to be my last visit."

4,"A Convenient Pit Stop: McDonald's Anupam Chitra Mandir, Goregaon East Review

Located inside Anupam Chitra Mandir in Goregaon East, this McDonald's outlet is a convenient pit stop for commuters and movie-goers alike. We recently visited this outlet and tried the Grilled Chicken and Cheese burger with Salsa fries and Coke zero combo ‚Äì here's what we thought!

Ambiance: 4/5
As a quick-service restaurant, the ambiance is functional and no-frills. However, the outlet is clean and well-maintained, with comfortable seating for those who want to dine in.

Food: 4/5
We tried the Grilled Chicken and Cheese burger, which was cooked to perfection. The chicken patty was juicy and flavorful, and the cheese added a nice creaminess. The Salsa fries were crispy and spicy, and paired well with the burger. The Coke zero combo was a great value addition.

As this outlet is located near Goregaon East station, it attracts a lot of crowd, especially during peak hours. However, the staff is efficient and manages to handle the rush with ease.

Verdict
This McDonald's outlet is a great option for those looking for a quick and convenient meal. The food is consistent with McDonald's standards, and the staff is friendly and efficient. While it may get crowded, the outlet is well-managed and worth a visit if you are near by.

Rating: 4/5 stars

Price: ‚Çπ200-‚Çπ400 per person

Recommended for: Commuters, movie-goers, and those looking for a quick and convenient meal.

Will I return?
Yes, for a quick bite or meal on-the-go!"
1,"Very bad quality of product delivery. Received an incomplete , ver very poor quality , badly mad and to highlight BURGER BUN WAS MISSING. How can the burger bun be missing in a burger ? Very very badly prepared. I doubt if it tamped with. Order this late night for dinner from McDonald after long working hour WAS A BIG MISTAKE. WONT EVER EAT AND LET EAT MCD BURGER AGAIN. And additionally I wasn‚Äôt even give a full refund plus I am going to sleeping without eating dinner.

Don‚Äôt eat. Very poor quality these days in every mcd outlets if you don‚Äôt want to mess with your health then don‚Äôt eat."
5,"Great ambiance, comfortable seating, and delicious food! The cheesy fries and coffe are a must-try."
5,The food was amazing I had some burger and wrap service was excellent by Sachin was polite and high quality i will definitely visit regularly
5,Visited this outlet with friends for eat and meet. Good and clean seating area but everytime crowded. The service is very good. Automatic POS machine working properly.
5,"Pizza Caprina is another beautiful pizza delivery outlet which delivers an amazing range of Pizza with some delicious taste. Have ordered the Pizza few days back only and was surprised with the taste. Just loved the quantity and taste of the Pizza from here.

Well this time we were at a friend's place and ordered the Pizza for some snack. We are a great fan of Junk foods and well it was a Pizza day for us as all of us wanted to eat Pizza. So ordered :

Chicken Feast Pizza :

Shocked by the Size of the Pizza but Surprised by the quantity, thickness & weight of it. Haven't had such stuffed pizza in recent times. Already the pizza was filled with lots of Chicken Kheema, Chicken Salami, & Sausages.. we opted for the cheese burst and man-o-man it was too much to finish it it up for all. Maximum of two piece is enough for a person and we were satisfied with the taste too.

Chilly Cheese toast : the chilly toast was not that surprising the way this Pizza did but it was good too. Moreover if they would have put mozzarella cheese or melted cheese on top it would have enhanced more cheesiness in the bread. It was a good appetizer though.

Chocate Mousse : It kind of felt like an adulterated Mousse as we couldn't find the originality in the taste. The Mousse was good in taste but somewhere down the line it was no value for money. Could have been more original and tastier."
5,Good pizza at best prices. Even taste was also good. Paneer chilly pizza was best just loved it. One large is enough for 4.
4,"Are you searching for cheesy pizza just like Joey's with a bit less price?
Then this is the place.Pizza Carina pizza's are just mouth watering.It is so cheesy and the crust is also so soft with lots of toppings.
There is no sitting arrangement.So wanna enjoy their pizzas then order it at home.I have ordered from here twice and I don't regret it at all.
I have ordered butter chicken (it's not there in the picture),panner tikka, garlic bread and roasted chicken garlic bread.

Butter Chicken:This is my all time favorite pizza.The taste is just like Joey's pizza.It is literally mouth watering.Lots of toppings(chicken) with lots of cheese.

Panner tikka:It wasn't that good.After having chicken pizza this was too taste less for me.But the topics were too much.And it would have been more tastier if it would have hot.

Roasted chicken garlic bread:There is nothing better than these garlic bread.It was way too awesome.(MUST TRY)

Garlic bread:The sides were crunchy and tasty.I liked it.üçïü•ñ

Recommended:roasted chicken garlic bread and butter chicken pizza.
Cost:300-400 for 3-4 people
Quantity:4.5/5
Quality:4/5"
5,"Pizza Caprina is Delivery Kitchen based in Goregaon. üìå
They serve some yummy pizzas. The packaging was good. Also the delivery was on time.

What I order :
Chicken Feast - cheese burst :- Delicious... the pizza was stuffed with chicken pieces and chicken kheema. It was amazingly cheesy. One 10"" pizza can easily satisfy 2-3 people.

Chicken Bruschetta - Good taste and Flavourful

Chocolava cake - yummy dessert üòãüòãüòã"

I had a basic of their pizza mania pizzas like golden corn and paneer onion capsicum. Must say it was very Creamy. A unique Deshi flavored sauce in Paneer pizza tastes really unique. Cherry on the cake was Unlimited Coldrinks Glass.
Superfun!"
1,"FRAUD ALERT
This dominos is outright fraud. Refer screenshots.
order placed on 26th feb 25 - 12 AM. I have still not received the order.

delivery partner and store phone doesn't work - refer screenshot.

1800 number and app - no option to report fraud.

my sleep, health and subsequent day has gone for a toss.

PS - they closed the ticket by saying i didnt answer phone - when they haven't even called me yet

I Intend to proceed with legal proceeding against the owner and delivery person"
1,"Worst delivery & Service which is one of there biggest drawback. The customer service attendant & deliver boys are super non professional and serial offenders of the same.
The compensation formalities & the customer satisfaction or customer experience is disgrace, where the customer has to compromise & do the follow up yet they never improve their service."
1,"Absolutely Pathetic. Our bulk order was delayed by 1 hour 45 mins. Eventually had to send our people to pick up .. no customer service, cold horrible pizzas and they had the audacity to say that we have only 2 people at the outlet so we couldnt cope up.

Also Zomato misguided us by continouls saying order is delayed by 10 mins and revising it

Kids were hungry from 1:14 to 3 pm"
4,This place is good.  Its service is fast and good we ordered chicken pizza it tasted great.  area was clean but same washroom clean nahi.
5,"Love their dhokla's. They have a lot of variety as well.  But I love this place for their Locho. Not many places in the city serve good lochos's which is why I come here every time I feel like having one. While the best lochos's are in Surat, Radhe Dhokla does fairly well in serving a good one."
4,"It‚Äôs a decent restaurant for Chinese cuisine with a desi touch. We tried their Chicken Assorted Platter that came in with wantons, spring rolls, sesame chicken and fried chicken - which was well-cooked and delicious. The chicken combo noodles with hot garlic sauce set were flavourful! The food paired very well with virgin mojito and sea breeze mocktail.

The place in itself is quite compact and can get congested sometimes. There is abundant parking around the restaurant in case you are planning to drive.

However, over all, Fire Bowl does satisfy the desi Chinese craving."

Mains- Pad Thai, Seafood Fried rice, Tenderloin Fried Rice, Mongolian chicken
Chicken soup

Appetizers were good-  pad Thai and Mongolian chicken amazing

_ve: service was slow. It took a long time for menus to reach our table. Apps took forever to get to the table . 2nd round of drinks also took a long time
Overall this is a good place to visit .As a former resident of Malad and who visit to meet family, I am glad to see these restaurants open in the hood .. no need to travel all the way to Bandra or the city centre anymore ."

Located in Goregaon East, Near railway station, Dimsum wu is now one of the most emerging food restaurants which serve great quality food and a variety of Chinese, Bao's, Momos and other delicacies. This place is very clean and hygienic and well maintained. Recently ordered few items from here :-

‚ñ™Ô∏èChicken Lollipop - One of the best seller items of dimsum wu, 6 pieces of fried chicken Lollipop tasted very good and was an amazing starter option.

‚ñ™Ô∏èBurnt Chilli Garlic Rice Chicken - A combination of chicken pieces with a tasty blend of chili garlic sauce was an amazing rice option which was of good taste & quantity.

‚ñ™Ô∏èNasi Goreng Chicken - One of the best items you can order from dimsum wu. It was mouthwatering & tasty and was value for money. Loved the taste & quality.

All the food items i ordered were absolutely fresh and delivery was done before time & the food was warm. Packaging done was perfect and the food quality was great. The food quantity was decent and filling with alot of chicken pieces. Dimsum wu has all the items priced reasonably and provide value for money. My Ordering experience was wonderful and I would highly suggest everyone to order food from here and have a great time."
5,"Saturday night we had some guests coming over and we wanted them to try something delicious yet authentic. We decided to call in for some oriental cuisine however we also did not want to conpromise on the taste and quality. Thats why we called in from dimsum wu.

They serve delicious dimsums and they are perfectly made. We tried chicken sui mui dimsums. It had a delightful combination of chicken, mushrooms and basil. For the appetizers, we tried prawns in butter garlic sauce. Although a classic dish, many restaurants cant do this dish well but here they did full justice to it. The sauce had the perfect consistency and went so well with the chicken hakka noodles. The noodles were thin and had a nice flavour to it. The quantity was just perfect and there was no compromise on the quality and authenticity.

Definitely a must try! Do not skip their dimsums , they are one of the best in town."
5,"Recently ordered few Non-Veg items from Dimsum W≈´. This is a delivery outlet located in Goregaon East.

We were in the mood of eating chicken option, so ordered

Fried Chicken Teriyaki Sushi  - Tried fried sushi for the first time and loved it. Definitely going to order again. The taste was nice, and the sauce they use on the top makes it even tastier.

Smoked Honey Chicken - I loved the sweet and tangy taste of chicken and the bell peppers. Just a perfect starter to go along with any drink.

Chicken & Cheese Momos (Tandoori) - The tandoori option is available at very few places. So I had to order this one. The tandoori masala taste was nice and the Cheese and chicken stuffing were done well.

Would definitely order again from Dimsum W≈´"

5,"We were craving for some Chinese food. So my foodie friend recommend this place and ordered from here. Order 3 dishes from here.
1. Chicken Tandoori Wheat Momo's : Really recommended for non-veg Momo's lovers. Cooked to perfection and the stuffings of chicken were well done. Just a perfect starter to along with any drink.
2. Chicken Devil Fire Wheat Momo's : As the name suggest ""This devil is really on fire"". A must try momos. Over all the flavor added were scrumptious. The flavor of spices were strong as per needed.
3. Drunken Fish Noodles : The noodles were quite flat and thin, but did the job good in tasting. Full of veggies and finely chopped fish pieces. The quantity was also pretty good and filling.

Fantastic experience! They got really best Chinese cuisines in the town. Rich in taste and value for money outlet.

May be those people will improve quality in future add More items not just pizza place."

1,"I'm writing to report a distressing experience with my recent order from the Goregaon West outlet. Today I ordered a pizza and garlic bread, but upon consumption, I found a cockroach in the garlic bread. I've attached a photo for reference.

I've tried contacting the outlet, but unfortunately, the shift manager was unavailable, and I couldn't get a satisfactory response. I'm extremely disappointed with the lack of attention to quality and customer service.

I'd appreciate it if someone could look into this matter urgently and take necessary actions to prevent such incidents in the future. I've spoken with Mr. Prince Ghanshyam Sharma about this issue . Prince force me to provide the garilc bread . After i said i don‚Äôt want the replacement he force me to collect . He has send the delivery guy at my home at 11:45 pm ."
1,Extremely unhygienic outlet (SV Road Goregaon west) . Everything was out of order. Entrances porch was clogged with water and unmanaged electric wires dangling under feet. Tables were uncleaned with fly and mosquitoes all around. All the AC machines were leaking water on us. Should be under many major health violations.
1,"The store manager(prince) should be fired.
I didn't think Dominos could fall even further but after my last experience they proved me wrong.

Order delivered 2 hours after placing it and completely cold. The store didn't have the courtesy to even warm up the food or call to inform the order will be delayed, instead they opted to switch off their listed number.

None of their employee(delivery person or the store manager) bother to even apologise.  Instead the store manager decided to show more attitude than his managerial skills. This has completely convinced me to never order from Dominos ever again."
4,"Domino‚Äôs Pizza has always been a staple for Pizza lovers around the world. We had 2 regular size Margarita Pizza delivered to our place which were both in Whole Wheat Crust.
This was the 1st time I had tried the regular size in this crust and I have to say it was very interesting. The sauce to cheese ratio was fine, they delivered the Pizza within 30 mins so I had no complaints

1,"Not a very hygienic place to order healthy food from. Placed order online through Zomato. The BBQ chicken salad had live and dead insects inside, it is evident that the vegetables were not cleaned properly before preparing the salad. The vegetables were not fresh at all. It might have been prepared and kept in storage."
1,"Absolutely Shocking and Unacceptable ‚Äì Misleading ‚ÄúPure Veg‚Äù Claim at Edesia by FreshMenu, Thane

I am writing this review with deep disappointment, frustration, and anger over what can only be described as a gross negligence and complete lack of responsibility by Edesia by FreshMenu, Thane.

My girlfriend, a lifelong vegetarian who strictly avoids non-vegetarian food due to religious and personal beliefs, ordered a Rainbow Club Whole Wheat Sandwich from this place. The sandwich was clearly labeled and advertised as ‚ÄúPure Veg‚Äù. Based on that assurance, she felt safe and comfortable placing the order.

However, what she received was a complete betrayal of that trust.

As soon as she took a bite, she sensed that something was wrong‚Äîthe texture and taste didn‚Äôt match any vegetarian ingredient. She immediately stopped and checked more carefully‚Ä¶ only to realize that the sandwich contained chicken! This was not a small mistake‚Äîit was a devastating violation of someone‚Äôs faith and deeply held beliefs.

She was so disturbed by the experience that it affected her emotionally and mentally for the rest of the day. This is not just a mix-up. This is a serious issue that can hurt someone‚Äôs religious sentiments, mental health, and trust in the food industry.

How can a hotel claim something is 100% vegetarian and still serve meat? Who is responsible for this carelessness? Is there no check, no process, no respect for people‚Äôs food preferences or religion?

We reached out for clarification and expected a sincere apology or explanation. But what we got was just casual replies and no real accountability.

To everyone reading this: please be extremely cautious if you‚Äôre ordering from Edesia by FreshMenu, Thane. If you‚Äôre vegetarian or have dietary restrictions, don‚Äôt believe what‚Äôs written on their menu‚Äîthey are clearly unreliable and careless with labeling and food handling.

This isn‚Äôt a joke. This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúsmall error.‚Äù This is serious. If such a mistake can happen once, it can happen again‚Äîand next time, someone might have a medical condition or allergy that puts their life at risk.

To the management: You owe your customers more than just food‚Äîyou owe them honesty, safety, and respect. What you served was not just chicken‚Äîit was ignorance and carelessness disguised as food.

I hope this review reaches many people and serves as a wake-up call not only to this outlet but to every restaurant that takes vegetarian labeling lightly.

Zero stars if that was an option"
1,"I recently ordered the Paneer Chilli from FreshMenu and was highly disappointed with the quality of the dish. The paneer was extremely hard and undercooked, making it nearly inedible. It appeared as though only red chilli sauce had been mixed with it, lacking any other flavors or proper cooking.

Upon contacting the restaurant manager, a replacement was sent to me, but unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations either. While it was marginally better than the first one, the paneer was still hard and unappetizing. This experience leads me to believe that the raw materials used in this establishment may not be fresh.

Based on my experience, I would advise others to avoid ordering food from this restaurant until they can improve their quality control and ensure that dishes are properly prepared using fresh ingredients."
1,"Extremely Disappointed ‚Äì Got Stale Food and Fell Sick!

I ordered from this restaurant‚Äôs Goregaon branch via Swiggy, and the experience was absolutely horrible. The food was stale, smelly, and clearly not fresh. Within minutes of eating, I felt nauseous and ended up vomiting. My husband ate the same food and also fell ill.

What‚Äôs even more shocking is that he had a similar experience earlier when he ordered from their Jogeshwari branch ‚Äì bad quality and stale food. So this isn‚Äôt just a one-time mistake, it‚Äôs a serious issue with this entire brand.

When I checked Google reviews, I saw that many people have complained about poor hygiene and spoiled food. The few positive reviews seem suspicious, possibly from people who know the owner.

This place is risking people's health and should not be allowed to operate like this. Swiggy and food authorities seriously need to step in. DO NOT ORDER from here!"
1,Bought Mumbai Burger from outlet opp Railway station Ghatkopar west at Rs.29 and same is costing Rs 39 at Nirvana Enterprises ( Franchise of  Jumbo king) Kalyan . There is no AC etc and they say we are charging mall prices whereas its a standalone outlet on road

1,"Some repair work was going on while they were serving customers. Water leakage and spillage on the floor. The serving staff who was handling food, soft serves and beverages was also the one taking orders and MOPPING the floor with the stick mop. Without cleaning/sanitizing her hands. Understaffed and in a bad condition. The waiting time is 20 minutes for a burger and a coffee."
3,"The food is fresh & good. Service is good. The restaurant can use some TLC, looks worn out & old. Not wheelchair friendly as its on 1st floor and there's no elevator."

Hope you take it in a positive way."

5,"Spukies Goregaon

I have tried their Andheri outlet which I had a really great experience which my previous review shows, so I went for their Goregaon outlet.

As I said for the Andheri outlet as well, this is also a great place to order food for the vegetarian.

As we all look for lesser delivery time and good food, both is understood and taken care by Spukies.

The dishes which we ordered were Cheese Pav bhaji, Vegatable Tawa Pulao and Chocolate Walnut Fudge.

Cheese Pav bhaji - Pav Bhaji and that also with cheese, my personal favorite when it comes to veg.

Vegetable Tawa Pulao- The Tawa Pulao was well cooked, in the cold winter also it had remained hot due to its good packaging, till I finished my Pav bhaji.

Chocolate Walnut Fudge- Tried in Andheri outlet also it was nice.

They impressed me with their food. I am sure for lunch or dinner I would definitely order from this place.

P.S: This review is strictly depending on my personal experience."
5,Great Place for home delivery.  Their North Indian is amazing and best part is it is PURE VEG.
3,Had heard alot about this place but it was not upto the expectation Paneer tikka masala was ok ok not that great and even the quantity was less comapred to similar restaurants.
1,"Trust me.. this is the worst place to eat food. These guys don't know how to cook. I ordered paneer chilli after looking at the reviews.. but honestly I have never seen paneer floating in oil.

DONT GO BY THE REVIEWS.. THEY PAY MORE ON REVIEWS THAN ON FOOD

If you really want to live more and enjoy your life.. stop urself from ordering this stupid place. I don't know how they even survive.

NO ONE WILL ORDER TWICE FROM THIS DUMB PLACE.."

We stopped by the food court at Oberoi Mall and decided to try Sbarro for a quick pizza fix. The outlet is well-placed and clean, with an open counter where you can see the different pizza slices on display ‚Äì fresh and inviting. Service was efficient, and our order was ready within minutes, served hot.

We tried three slices:

1. Chicken Stuffed Crust Slice
This was easily the highlight. The crust was thick and perfectly baked with a satisfying crunch on the outside, and packed with flavorful, juicy chicken stuffing inside. The toppings were balanced, with a good blend of cheese and sauce that didn‚Äôt overpower the stuffing. It‚Äôs a rich, indulgent slice and perfect if you‚Äôre really hungry or craving something filling.

2. Tandoori Chicken Slice
This one brings in the desi twist. The tandoori chicken pieces were tender and well-marinated, giving that smoky, spiced kick you‚Äôd expect from a good tandoori dish. The base was soft and had a nice chew, and the sauce had a slight tang that paired well with the Indian spices. It‚Äôs a great choice if you‚Äôre in the mood for something with more flavor and spice.

3. Double Cheese Margherita Slice
Simple but satisfying. The cheese pull was great ‚Äì rich, gooey, and layered generously. The tomato base was slightly sweet and complemented the creaminess of the cheese. This one is perfect if you‚Äôre a classic pizza lover or want a comforting, no-frills option.

Overall, Sbarro at Oberoi Mall is a reliable spot for pizza lovers. The variety of slices is a plus, and the quality was better than expected for a mall food court setting. One star off only because the prices are slightly on the higher side for single slices, and the seating area can get quite crowded during peak hours. Still, great flavors, quick service, and worth visiting if you‚Äôre around."
3,"SBARRO Pizza ‚Äì Perfectly Sized for One

SBARRO offers a delightful single-serving pizza that‚Äôs just right for a quick bite. The slice features a crispy, thin crust, generous toppings, and a savory sauce that strikes the perfect balance of flavor. Whether you‚Äôre grabbing a meal on the go or satisfying a sudden pizza craving, the single portion is both convenient and delicious. The overall experience is enhanced by friendly service and a casual ambiance, making SBARRO a great choice for solo dining."
5,"A good place for new york style pizza, we had their veggie supreme pizza and garlic bread with cheese dip. A combo was available with adding nominal amount for cold drink. The pizza was thin crust loaded with veggies and garlic bread was crispy and tasted good.  Overall a good experience and worth the price paid."

1,Pizza was absolutely dry and not cheesy at all. I asked for cheesy garlic bread and that too was super dry not cheesy at all. It was a great disappointment. They should stop calling themselves ‚ÄúTHE ORIGINAL NEW YORK PIZZA‚Äù coz pizza in New York are super cheesy. My son couldn‚Äôt eat it only as it was not cheesy and chewy.
5,"Great flavours with natural tasting icecream. The best you will get!! Their seasonal stuff is amazing, actual fruit with the yummy vanilla"
5,One of the best Ice cream brands in Mumbai. My personal favorite is malai. They have various seasonal flavours and the sundae's and shakes are too good.
5,"Where ever you find naturals, just go for it... Great taste, amazing flavors... Sitafal, tender coconut, mango (seasonal), lichi (seasonal), all are best across all ice cream brands..."
5,Loved all the flavors especially the Tender Coconut and Chiku/Sapota ones. The Jalebi flavored one is a must try. But not recommended for people with high sugar.
5,"Awesome ice creams with fruits pulp and pieces in it. Tastes natural, not very sweet, tastes like the fruit only."
1,Don't try...you will loss your money...& time....its third class
3,"HAS Juice - Located in Oberoi Mall‚Äôs food court serves Fresh juice and salad. When asked for only carrot juice, the person at the counter mentioned its not available (strange!). Then ordered the ABC (Apple, Beetroot and Carrot) juice which turned out to be mediocre as its was quite watery.

Customer services needs to be improved as the person at counter is least interested to take any order."
1,"Guys don't drink juice, it's mix of seckraine they are fraud, they give you juice with cold pressed, they are fooling u on behalf of fresh juice, don't drink !"
3,"Located at top level of Oberio Mall sandwiched between Burger King & Taco Bell, it is a small outlets but commands it's own patron.

The selling point is health. But don't be surprised if you don't get your desired drink. This is what happened to us. We wanted avocado juice, but to our dismay there weren't any. Neither were there any notification that specific drinks are not available.

We settled for grapes and berry juice. For the taste, we think there were added sugar to enhance the taste. But good enough. They ask you beforehand if you want ice added or not. Stick to seasonal fruits & vegetables.

Experience: A very disinterested person took our order with short responses. It took about 3 to 5 min on a weekday for my order. Straws provided are sealed (+ point). They accept cash, paytm and cards."
3,"Tried fruit bowl and it was very good but few fruits were missing like mango,dragon and many other fruits,I felt quantity was also less.
I wish they give proper fruit bowl of whatever they charged."
5,"We had lunch on weekend at this outlet at Oberoi Mall, Goregaon. The food quality was excellent with a feel of real Maharaja. Premium thali on weekend cost Rs799/- plus taxes. The menu set for the day was amazing. Kesar drink, dahiwada, aamras, dal badam halva  needs special mention as these items were very much tasty. Nice ambience, internal arrangement and so the service. They keep serving in your thali till you say no.There was waiting but could enter within 10 minutes. Value for money. Deserves Full marks."
4,"Maharaja Bhog is located on the 3rd floor of Oberoi Mall (Goregaon), just next to the Food Court.
The Vegetarian Thalis are priced ~ Rs 750 each and taste delicious! The welcome drink was cool and helped to set the taste for the dishes to come.
Each of the veg dishes tastes good, along with the dals. They had 3 types of breads - I personally liked the phulkas.
They also had veg pulao which was passable, but loved the Dal Khichdi. My only problem was with the ghee (no matter how many spoons I added, I just didn‚Äôt get the flavour!). The Shrikhand was Amazing!
The service was good and prompt - the servers would keep coming to ask if we needed any dish to be repeated.
The receptionist at the entrance was especially nice as he offered to take our pictures, while sitting on the Royal throne wearing a regal turban.
Will definitely come back for more."
4,"Maharaja Bhog truly lives up to its name by offering a dining experience fit for royalty. I visited the restaurant on my friend‚Äôs birthday after hearing a lot about its traditional thalis, and it was just as good as expected. I was impressed by the effort put into the thali, with its variety of flavors and beautiful presentation.

The restaurant has a mix of luxury and tradition, and the staff is friendly and attentive. They make sure you have everything you need and keep checking in often and offering more delicious dishes. The service shows they care about making every guest feel special.

Dining here was a rich and satisfying experience. If you are looking for an authentic and traditional Rajasthani and Gujarati thali, this is the place to visit.

4,"Belgian waffles are a delightful treat! Crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and perfect with toppings like whipped cream, fruits, or syrup. Simple, yet so satisfying!"
1,"Food was late
Chips were stale
Paneer seems to be old. Coffee was fine"
4,"This outlet of Belgian waffle located in the food court of oberoi mall.. Small outlet but serves one of the best waffles in Mumbai at affordable price.. Staff in this outlet was really kind & good service was been provided to us.. Very courteous and suggestive staff.. On their suggestion, ordered Rocky Road which is Waffle Ice cream Sundae...
.
Waffles are made fresh and prepared in front of you.. Waffles are always loaded with good amount of choco spread which is the best part of Belgian waffle.. The hot crunchy waffle outside and cold soft ice cream inside and dark chocolate topping was a heavenly combination.. This is the perfect place if you have a sweet tooth..!!"
5,Awesome taste as well as staff so supportive to choose best waffle work rs only 130
5,"Any chocolate enthusiast must taste the triple chocolate waffle..
The waffle with dark chocolate is just as delicious..
Although the food is fantastic, I did notice that the service was a little slower than in other outlets..
All in all, this is a good spot to fulfill your chocolate cravings - just be ready to wait a little while for your order.."
3,"Ordered in from the Burger King outlet at Oberoi Mall recently, curious to try their new Korean range specifically the Korean Spicy Chicken Burger. Honestly, it was a pleasant surprise. The burger had a nice crunch, the chicken was juicy, and that spicy Korean sauce really added a solid kick of flavor. It actually tasted way better than the Korean-style burger McDonald‚Äôs offers. This one had more depth and a better balance of spice and sweetness.

We also got the Chicken Nuggets, hoping for a full fast-food feast but that‚Äôs where it fell flat. The nuggets were quite underwhelming. They lacked the crisp coating you‚Äôd expect, and the flavor was pretty bland. Compared to McDonald‚Äôs nuggets (which are kind of the gold standard), these just didn‚Äôt hold up at all.

So overall, it was a mixed bag definitely recommend trying the Korean Spicy Chicken Burger if you‚Äôre into bold flavors, but the nuggets were a miss. Wouldn‚Äôt rush to reorder those."
1,"I took a take out a veg korean burger meal  an when i opened the packet at home it was a chicken burger. It was a peak time they were out of firies, panicking over high demand of cold coffee and I think they are not prepared for peak hours. How can you give a vegetarian customer A chicken burger and when I called to complain they were saying I called them so late they dont even have staff to deliver a replacement to me and I just told her that I am not expecting a replacement or refund but they should know what they did and she did not even said sorry about it  and I told her atleast feel sorry about it than after my 10mins conversation she said sorry. Bringing chicken at my home made me so angry that I have to search and write a review about it"
1,"Worst Service ever I ordered the meal and lava cake from burger king but I have received product like this I had shared image with you guys
Even Not Burger King people's responding not even delivery boy responding
This is the service of burger king ( Oberoi Mall )
Around the bill amount was 500/- Delivery Boy is telling this is a mistake of Store they have not packed food properly
2 ndly in my delivery there was 1 product is missing"
3,Visited with friends. The order consisted of chicken veg n paneer burgers with fries n a cheesy fry which had too mych cheese. The lady who took the order messed up the order by giving lesser cokes n after showing the order details it was sorted.They then gave us an extra veg burger which we returned. The French fries were hot n yummy .we got ketchup on t side. Everyone felt that the burgers were a little spicy. My Paneer burger was spicy n I couldn't finish it as I didn't like t spice level. The service is good but t product itself needs customisation which was not asked for or overall improvement
2,"It was Sunday 5th may, high crowd, got my order slightly delayed but it‚Äôs okay. My concern is about food hygiene, have observed a hair in chicken wings piece. Request to improve hygiene and cleanliness"
5,"Visited Malgudi and had an absolutely satisfying South Indian meal!
We tried the Malgudi Special Tiffin ‚Äî a perfect combo if you want to sample a bit of everything. The Ghee Roast Podi Dosa was crispy, flavorful, and packed with that punchy podi goodness. The Pav Bhaji Dosa was a fun fusion twist ‚Äî surprisingly delicious!
Washed it all down with a strong, aromatic Filter Kapi, just the way it should be.
Prices felt fair for the taste and quality ‚Äî definitely worth it if you're craving authentic South Indian flavours with a modern touch.

Highly recommend this spot for dosa lovers!"
4,"A Taste of South India at Malgudi
Malgudi, nestled within the vibrant Oberoi Mall, offers a delightful culinary journey through the diverse flavors of South India. This charming restaurant brings the authentic taste of the South to Mumbai, transporting you to the bustling streets of Chennai and the serene backwaters of Kerala.

5,"Malgudi at Oberoi Mall

Malgudi at Oberoi Mall is a delightful South Indian gem that delivers both charm and flavour in equal measure. The moment you step in, you‚Äôre greeted with warm service, inviting traditional d√©cor, and a calm, cozy ambience that makes dining here a truly comforting experience.

The food is the star here, with beautifully curated Tiffin Thalis that offer a taste of South India‚Äôs culinary richness. I tried the Malgudi Special Tiffin Thali, a delicious mix of lemon rice, Malabar Paratha, Veg Curry Malabar, and the most fragrant Pineapple Sheera‚Äîserved with your choice of Filter Coffee, Masala Tea, or Masala Milk. Every bite felt authentic and thoughtfully prepared.

The Chettinadu Tiffin Thali with soft Neer Dosa and the bold Chettinadu Veg Curry was another standout. And if you‚Äôre a dosa lover, don‚Äôt miss the Benne Podi Masala Dosa‚Äîcrispy on the outside, buttery inside, and full of flavour.

A big plus is that these Tiffins are available for both dine-in and delivery, and there‚Äôs a great BOGO offer that makes it even better value.

If you‚Äôre in Oberoi Mall, Malgudi is a must-visit for a soulful, satisfying South Indian meal."
1,"Horrible experience at the restaurant overall:-

1) Very bad idli texture
2) Vada was not at all crispy ( It tasted like I am eating boiled vada )
3) Coconut Chutney was spoiled.
4) Rude Staff (For reference: I placed order between 1:00 to 1:45 on 11th May and there was a lady on the counter)
5) Was not able to find difference whether it was daal or  Sambhar.

Google has 4 star rating and zomato has 3.1,  I'd say don't go by googles rating I think they are fake."
5,"Food was great! And even better was the service. Truly appreciate the manager Praveen (Malgudi, Oberoi Mall) , who took efforts to understand my specific need and serve me a perfect glass of coffee - suited to my taste. Thanks Team Malgudi, I will be back, soon for yet another great experience!!"
3,Cool place! Always loved their donuts. Although I feel like their taste has changed lately.
5,"I was so intrigued by the sign that we stopped at MOD in Oberoi mall at Goregaon. I'm not a huge fan of donuts but MOD took my heart. Their donuts are delicious and totally worth the splurge.

AMBIENCE
It couldn't be considered as something different or great as it's a part of food court of the mall. But seatings are made available properly.

FOOD
We first gasped for a cup of coffee. We were so impressed with the selections of donuts that I succumbed to Double Trouble and it was absolutely delicious!
I would say they are fair judge on all different flavors, quality and freshness. Their some donuts are crispy from outside but still soft from inside.
Hot chocolate with some tastiest donuts ever stuffed with flavour well worth a try.

STAFF
Staff is super courteous and helps you to choose based on your preference. They've kind gesture and are always polite.

A great stop for a tasty and delicious donuts highly recommend if you're a donut fan."

1,"I wish to register a complaint against Mad Over Donut, Oberoi Mall, Goregaon outlet where we found live cockroaches roaming over the donuts on 17th September 2023 evening. I was about to purchase an order for my kids and found out this gross thing. I suppose you can imagine our disappointment when we found these insects roaming around freely in your display cabinets. Can you please tell me how are you going to justify this act of dirtiness?

I want your representatives to reach out to me on priority basis at the earliest on contact numbers mentioned in below signature. Also, my intention in writing this email is to ask you to issue a ""show cause notice"" to the supervisor at your restaurant, and disseminate instructions to all your staff against such situations. I am hoping that you would maintain your food standards and probe into the event taking strict disciplinary actions against all involved. Please find attached videos showing this act of ignorance and negligence.

As a matter of precautions, I'll also be writing regarding this incident at The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) is administered by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India."
5,Amazing place to chill with place. Located at oberoi mall goregaon east this place is a good place to hangout and have drinks with friends. They have variety of options. I had their coco cooler which was very refreshing. Also their cuppacino and macchiato were really good. Would recommend you to have their quinoa and avocado salad and portuguese style chicken good option for starters. Also avocado and burrata toast was delicious.
1,"went on sat , didnt find it much filled .Firstly we sat for literally 10 mins without a single waiter approaching us with either the menu or water or anything. Once we ordered the food came farely quick.The eggplant mamzana & fish and chips was good at best in taste and nothing special. While eating the chips we needed the tomato ketchup which was in our table in a bottle so we used that and realised that the ketchup had become sour and has spoiled , god knows for how long that bottle had been sitting there without being checked, when we told them they replaced it. minor point, but we didnt complain, then came the chicken sizzler, worth 1600! rs , guess what was in it, huge serving of maida noodles which they claim is spaghetti , a huge wad of burnt veggies with no salt nothing, and imagine one piece of chicken breast, fillet as a butterfly , ONE PIECE! for 1600!, even when you claim it to be organic it wont cost that much!, its a bistro with fake instant food, nothing seemed to be fresh except fried things. i dont think people should visit this place expecting a real bistro with real made food, even the ratatouille we ordered felt microwaved. and let me guess , when you complain they will claim the quality of the food is the reason for the charge, its quality was equivalent to eating at a budget eatery in some shabby hut.I would recommend not wasting your money here."
5,"Amazing place and amazing food yummy and especially the service was so good and they were so supportive üòçüòçüòçservice was good and they also give respect and also provide varieties .

Must  visit place and i surely recommend this place to go ."
1,"1. One glass of wine is below 125ml ! Yes! However they claim it's 125ml LOL. And that 125ml wine costs more than the full bottle of the wine! ü§£ It's disgraceful to give a glass of wine only filled till 1/4th of the glass. It's disrespectful.
2. The chicken soup I ordered was just some average ready to cook chicken ball boiled in water. The soup clearly tasted like the chicken wasn't cooked in it.
3. Ordered Spaghetti Bolognese Pasta and I realised that it's just thin noodles that have been cut !!! Spaghetti pasta can't be broken and isn't that thin either.
4. The place doesn't have a toilet and requires customers to use the malls washroom, so when I needed to use the washroom midway through the meal, the staff asked me to leave my credit card with them if I need to use the washroom or I must clear the full bill to use the washroom."
5,"Olive Bistro at Oberoi mall highly recommended cannot be missed at all! Weekend vibes were so strong here, such a lively ambience and courteous staff! Classy ambience too! We had ordered chicken sizzler, hummus platter , french fries and watermelon mocktail! Yummy and tasty finger food options! The music was a bit loud but good joint for after office relaxation with your partner or friends!"
1,"Definitely one of the worst Domino‚Äôs outlets I‚Äôve ever come across. They never add the extra cheese or properly prepare cheeseburst orders, and despite complaining multiple times, nothing changes. On top of that, the hygiene here is a serious issue‚Äîcompletely unacceptable. The food quality is subpar, and the customer service is just as bad. Domino‚Äôs really needs to step in and inspect this outlet because it‚Äôs ruining their reputation. Honestly, Pizza Hut feels like a way better choice at this point. Attached are the images of a pizza that was ordered with extra cheese at the base and paid over and above fore"
3,No doubt the outlet is spacious but cleanliness could have been improved. This outlet is constantly short staffed. Offers are good and worthy but service could definitely have been better. It's on ground floor and on main road so expectations are more. Food was good undoubtedly but this outlet has a huge scope of improvement.
3,This outlet is conveniently located and easily accessible. The service is very helpful and the staff are kind and courteous.
1,Pizza is not baked properly. Delivery person came after 1 hour. Bad service.
2,the employees are very rude. their scanner was not working so they told me to not order. there is limited staff. for 10 mins i was waiting for someone to come at the counter and take my order. poor hygiene. there are people working continuously. the tables are also crooked. the worst dominos outlet!
5,"One of the best Pizza Palaces I'd say in Mumbai.

Eva's Pizza has gotta be the go-to Pizza place for the lovers of Pizza.

Pros:
1. Taste! Let me give a shoutout to ""Hurricane"" Pizza. Properly spiced and filled with Chicken Kheema and Sauces.
Must try.
Tried Chicken Makhani pizza as well. The taste was great as well.
2. Service: Quick service, very well behaved staff and polite.
3. Variety: Just go through the menu and check out the varieties of the Pizzas available. Choices at a premium.

Cons:
1. Just the ambience would be a little bit dull. However, satisfactory.

In a nutshell, Eva's Pizza is one of the best out there. You just have to go and try or Zomato the stuff out of it.

Still not over the Hurricane Pizza. Craving for another one already.

Edit after a few months: Hurricane Pizza is the best!"
5,"Excellent pizzas from Eva‚Äôs! I‚Äôd definitely order another time. We ordered the Chicken Pizza Mania and the Classic Veg Pizza both of which were amazing, juicy and properly loaded with toppings. Evas Pizza you rock!! Please continue delivering such amazing pizzas in the future too."
4,"Really great place for pizzas!
We often visit here during lunch time at work and the pizzas are great they taste good and are filling.
The ambiance need to be worked upon though a little makeover and this place will be one pf the best pizza places around."
4,Great option for Joey's pizza...I ordered 1 medium size mother's recipe and I feel that toppings were very less as compared to regular pizza and there was no coriander in pizza. Check my updated picture but the taste was good. You can use your magicpin points here
2,"Eva's Pizza has been on my bucket list for what feels like ages. With such great ratings, who wouldn't want to visit this place? However, the food left much to desire.

This outlet is unfortunately quite difficult to find. It's a small shop within a small lane. Parking will be difficult as both sides of the road were jam packed when we visited.

Sprawled with superhero art on the walls, Eva's has plenty of seating available but it would be best to book a table during weekends as it can get full.

Pizzas are available in two types of crust. You can also split a pizza in two and choose different toppings. We went for two pizzas with the half topping option. We went for the Veg Fantasy and Veg Deluxe on one pizza and the Mexican and Veg Florentine on the other.

The first mistake we made was to go with the regular crust on both pizzas. Eva's regular crust is just not good. The base is too doughy and they didn't bake it long enough. The toppings were good but there was just too much cheese. The seasoning was almost non-existent.

Service was mediocre. We weren't too pleased with the hygiene of the dining area as our table wasn't clean even after they wiped it down twice.

While the pizzas had a decent price, the taste wasn't there. Eva's Pizza is, disappointingly, a huge miss for me."

As this place is well known for their burger and their oh-so crispy and juicy chicken. We had bbq double decker burger, Tandoori tikka, nuggets, mixed chicken box, mojito and coconut shake. After trying the burgers I realised why people love their burgers so much. Freshly cooked patties, placed between fresh buns and voila, your burger is ready. Being a pocket friendly place, they serve good quantity. A must try from this place is tandoori tikka burger and coconut shake."

3,"Jumbo King is a popular Indian fast food chain that has garnered attention for its pocket-friendly burgers, modeled somewhat after international fast-food giants but tailored to Indian tastes. A typical review of Jumbo King‚Äôs burgers often highlights its affordability, making it a go-to option for students and budget-conscious customers. Their burgers are priced reasonably, usually ranging from INR 30 to INR 100, depending on the size and variety, which offers great value for money.

One of the standout aspects is their Vada Pav-inspired offerings. The Vada Pav, a traditional street food in Mumbai, is reimagined in burger form, appealing to local tastes. Many customers appreciate this fusion, noting that the burgers have a satisfying spiciness and fresh ingredients. However, compared to larger chains like McDonald's or Burger King, some reviews mention that the variety and taste might fall a bit short in terms of complexity and flavor.

On the downside, the portion sizes might leave some customers wanting more, and the lack of meat options limits the appeal for non-vegetarians. Some reviews also highlight that the consistency of quality can vary between outlets, with certain branches serving fresher and better-made burgers than others. Overall, Jumbo King‚Äôs burgers are well-suited for a quick, cheap, and localized fast food experience, but might not satisfy those looking for premium or gourmet options."
4,"A great option for Mumbaikars, The Mumbai burger at Jumbo King is mouthwatering. And The Sundar Nagar branch owner is welcoming, supportive, and handles bulk corporate orders with ease."
5,"Jumboking is a great fast food chain that offers delicious and affordable Indian-style burgers. Their menu has a good variety of options to choose from, including vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. The burgers are always fresh and tasty, and the service is quick and efficient. The staff is friendly and welcoming, making the overall dining experience enjoyable. The only downside is that the seating area can be a bit cramped during peak hours, but this is a minor issue. Overall, Jumboking is definitely worth a visit for anyone looking for a quick and satisfying meal."

4,"Very small joint which can accommodate a group of maximum 30 people. Ambience is chic. Food quality is good.  The name of the restaurant is mis-leading though as there is no real fine dining.  Nice place to have an evening get together for a small group.

They serve all brands of liquor including premium brands.

The big plus is the location of the hotel."

Seating is a little difficult to find, as there are only around 4 tables.
Masala pav bhaji is good and not very spicy. Also the cheese pav bhaji is not too heavy."
1,Again had bad experience with veg pizza . Told prior not to make spicy then too it was spicy. You should take care for the comments told By the client and make that way . Disappointed completely . Ordered for my daughter she didnt had a single piece .
4,"Pure veg jain restaurant, Taste is good but if you want to eat in resturant then they will charge 20 rs extra. Overall good experience."
5,"Fantastic, hygienic, food all at pretty economical rates (most dishes here cost less than üíØ rupees. The Pav Bhaji is high on taste, and low on oil & spice, not starkly different from the one we make at home. They'd have unique combinations like the Sada Mix, a filling combo of Pav Bhaji & Tawa Pulav (like how tawa Pulav should be, without any Chinese invasions. They have a variety of. Dishes and can dish up a mean lunch  (should try the lunch thali next time) A real good find, so all you hungry folks, if you happen to be in Mazgaon at lunchtime, go visit the place!!!!"
4,"Sudha Pav Bhaji is one of the amazing pavbhaji in Byculla area..

It's really tasty and even the price is not that costly..

They have other items apart from Pavbhaji like Manchurian,etc..

They also have outlet of Pani Puri just outside their AC section..

Unfortunately,the Paani Puri doesn't taste anymore,the way it used to..

Apart from that,it was a good experience..

Will strongly suggest,go for Pavbhaji not for Paanipuri.."
5,Good food at a very reasonable price. We went here on a Sunday afternoon. There is no dedicated parking for the hotel. But one can park on the road. The service was fast and the staff was polite and helpful. The food was good and tasty. The place is clean and hygienic.
1,"Had one of the worst experiences, no ambience at all, uncomfortable seating. As I went on the weekend the crowd was worse than in a fish market. Ordered Chicken Khepsa Rice which was salty as hell, after addressing this issue to the waiter he brought more plain rice which was salty too. Unfortunately had to pack it up due to all the menace. Atleast they gave 10% discount for their mistake that was the only good thing."
4,"‚Ä¢ I visited Mumbai Darbar, a renowned non-veg specialty restaurant, and opted for a vegetarian choice by ordering a paneer dish and cheese naan.

‚Ä¢ While I was fully aware of their non-veg reputation, I decided to try the veg options, and I was pleasantly surprised. üòÄ

‚Ä¢ The paneer dish was incredibly delicious, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to fellow vegetarians.

‚Ä¢ It's safe to say that I wasn't disappointed with my choice, and the taste was truly remarkable. üíØ

Non-veg specialist hotel but I ordered panner and it's was really great dish served to me was not a toll disappointing even I ordered VEG üòÑ"
1,Experienced very worst service.... Very very disappointed by choosing mumbai darbar for dinner... I ordered veg and they delivered me non veg how can a vegetarian person bare that and even after complaining the guy was not even said sorry for that pathetic worst zero rating
5,Located at 5 minute walking distance from Dockyard station. The kepsa here is an absolute delite. A full kepsa is enough for 4-5 people. Ambience is okay. Service is good and fast. The cost is reasonable.
5,"Personal Review of Grills & Wok ‚Äì A Memorable Monday Evening

Visited Grills & Wok this past Monday evening with a large group‚Äî8 adults and 10 kids‚Äîincluding friends from abroad, and I must say, it turned out to be a delightful experience. Located conveniently in Byculla East, the restaurant gave off a warm and cozy vibe right from the moment we walked in. Given our group‚Äôs size (and volume!), I was a bit apprehensive, but the staff was incredibly accommodating and ensured we felt welcomed throughout.

The food was nothing short of impressive. We started with the Roasted Chilli Chicken and Paneer Chilli‚Äîboth full of bold flavors and perfectly spiced. The kids absolutely loved the Crispy Noodles and Burnt Garlic Noodles, while the adults couldn't get enough of the Kung Pao Chicken and Chicken Paprika.

What truly stood out was the service. Despite our noise and multiple special requests (courtesy of the kids!), the staff maintained a smile and ensured everything was served promptly. They even rearranged tables to keep all the children together, which made the evening easier for the adults.

For a bill that was quite reasonable given the group size and the variety we ordered, it felt like great value. All in all, Grills & Wok proved to be the perfect setting for a relaxed, flavorful evening out with friends and family. Highly recommended, especially if you're entertaining guests from out of town."
4,"Great Food., Good Taste and œâ—îll Cooked Food , I really had liked the food because    ¬°—Ç was Fresh and great taste,service Was good , Must Try chicken Pot Rice,Garlic Fish And lemon Coriander Soup.

I must recommend, it‚Äôs worth FÔ£ßÃêÃ£Ã•R Money."
5,Excellent food n hospitality must visit grills & wok
3,"Review from 2024 - I ordered for Roasted Chicken chill and couldn‚Äôt was not too great. The staff is not one of the best when it comes to recommending food and neither the owners seems to be very interested.

I have tried Chinese seafood at this place in the past and they have been better than many others.

In conclusion, go to this place if you like Chinese seafood for Chinese chicken you may want to explore some different options.

Review from 2018 - Good Semi Desi Chinese food"
5,Best Chinese Restaurant in entire Patagonia area!!
5,"The food exceptionally good, the best you can have your Chinese food,must try is dragon fried rice and  russian soup,
The staff is super cooperative and delivers your orders perfectly and super on time"
5,Very comfortable place to eat in dongri.It remains open till night 3:00 am
5,"I recently tried the Korean Mauritius Rice at Mummy Kitchen, and it was an absolute delight! The fusion of Korean flavors with a Mauritian twist made for a unique and unforgettable experience. The rice was perfectly cooked, infused with aromatic spices, and had the perfect balance of savory and slightly sweet flavors.

The addition of fresh veggies, tender protein, and a hint of Korean spice gave it an authentic touch, while the Mauritian influence brought in a tropical warmth. The portion size was generous, and the presentation was top-notch.

If you're looking for something new and exciting, Korean Mauritius Rice is a must-try! Highly recommended for food lovers who enjoy fusion cuisine."
5,"If you're looking for a delightful fusion of flavors, Mummy Kitchen should definitely be on your list. The Chicken Shanghai Fried Rice is a standout dish that offers a perfect balance of tender chicken pieces, perfectly cooked rice, and a variety of fresh vegetables. The dish is well-seasoned, with a subtle hint of soy sauce and spices that elevate the experience without overpowering the other ingredients. Each bite is savory and satisfying, with just the right amount of heat and flavor.

The Hot and Sour Soup is another highlight. It's a comforting, bold dish that manages to blend spicy, sour, and savory notes in a harmonious way. The broth is rich and full of depth, with the right amount of tanginess, and the addition of tofu and mushrooms adds texture to each spoonful. It's a perfect dish to pair with the fried rice, as it complements the flavors beautifully.

The ambiance at Mummy Kitchen is warm and inviting, making it a great spot for both casual dining and special occasions. The service is friendly, and the food is served hot and fresh.

Overall, Mummy Kitchen provides a satisfying meal that hits all the right notes for those craving flavorful, comforting Asian cuisine. Highly recommended!"
5,The only Authentic Chinese restaurant near Noor Baugh area. Favorite amongst the locals especially the younger generation as the quality and taste has been maintained over the years.
3,"We had gone shopping in the old market and while strolling we saw the cake shop and decided to go in. We tried choco lava cake and Red velvet cheese cake. The red velvet cake was okay-ish, but the choco lava cake was better to taste. We also tried caramel flavoured milk drink. It was a packaged drink, I loved it. The shop ambience is also quite nice, it's good to go if you have sudden craving for chocolate cake or pastry."
1,"Monginis Sandhurst road sucks,I bought black forest cake for my younger sis birthday but unfortunately it got spoiled due to the third class quality of cake and it taste..the price I paid was 400 for half kg but it is not worth of 100Rs..whipped cream is spoiled and taste is disgusting ü•¥üò°..See the image you will understand..i want my money back and stop selling this kind of cakes.Person anme Ravi is very rude and tries to fight if you keep your words to him..he is like Gunda..have monginis started keeping Gundasü§î...Ams Confectioneries is not very pathetic..if I had minus start i would have given that too as it was stale cake."
1,"Read the following description to understand the purpose of 1 star rating.

1. I bought a heart shaped black forest cake. It appears fresh but actually stale. The cherries on this cake  aren't real ones, but those hard ones you find on a sweet Paan. I mean comeon, you can provide cherries for a cake priced at INR 400.

2. Their payment methods are really against the law. They don't accept credit cards. Reason - everything is online so we don't keep card machines.

3. They purposely keep their sound machine off because they want to scam people by saying they did not receive money through UPI. Ms. Mariyam is one of those.

4. There is no bill generated when we ask for. Why? This again looks suspicious.

All those above points is my experience today while buying the cake. Monginis cakes are really good to be placed in a trash box. Cakes by jeden, celejor, etc are same priced and very good quality."
4,"Best cakes ever. Fresh n tasty. Only one suggestion‚Ä¶ while writing name for birthday, pls use small opening cone. Large fonts does not look good."
1,"Very worst experience.
Today on 13th August 2019, I bought 2 pastries from Monginis Shop opp Sandhurst Station. I found chocolate on top of the Pastries was melted. . And while packing sales girl damaged the cake too. That time i found that  glass display counter where pastries kept was not at all cool. I inquired about the same then sales girl n sale man started defending that, pastries r kept without cooling temperature n its sold like that way only. I took the objection and asked to meet Owner. Then sales man called owner mr Ravi who was outside the shop. I put the issue before him. But even he insisted that chocolate pastries NOT kept in the cool temperature bcz it becomes very hard ..rock hard. Then I argued with him that , if this is the case then why big cakes kept in cool temperature. You r doing it just to save the electricity, But Mr Ravi was defending illogically. Then I took the bill,  paid it and collected the parcel. At home i tried its taste, but its chocolate was almost damaged and melted , i hv taken pics of the same n sharing with you all. I feel shopkeeper purposely NOT keeping the pastries in cool temperature  to save the electricity. But in that situation he is serving us damaged  cakes  and damaging the customer's health.
so i rate this shop for worst services."
4,Good place for family dining or snacking. It is average styled restaurant serving some delicious dishes. The chicken seekh biryani is worth trying. Chicken lollypop and chinese non-veg thalis are good budget friendly options with value for money.
5,Good taste and pocket friendly menu with enough quantity and quality of food. Try anything they are best in Mughlai and Chinese both
5,"Chicken Malai Seekh Biryani - 5 Stars for this

3,The food is good but the service is not.
4,"Visited during ramzan, chicken seekh kebabs were really great. Even the tikkas were flavourful. downside was only cash payment."
5,"Must try item Mutton Sikh kabab, you can try Chiken Sikh kabab as well but mutton Sikh kabab is most soft , juicy, flavourful."
2,"It used to be one of my favorite places to have tikkas and tandoori chicken, but recently their quality and taste has taken a hit. Tried Haji Tikka after long and left very disappointed after my visit. Located in the busy bohra mohalla they have better space with a seating room. Ordered the Tandoori chicken leg and it was so disappointing. The chicken didn't feel like chicken, felt like a batter or masala covering rather than eating the chicken on the outside. Also the taste was so bad, I don't know what they have done to their tandoori, which I used to love at one time. Worst part, it was totally undercooked from inside and raw. I informed the staff and what he did was just bluntly take away the half eaten chicken, recooked it again which obviously almost burnt some of the cooked chicken and served it back onto my table without any word. Also had the seekh kabab, which although not undercooked but tasted pretty average. It's sad to see when businesses grow, they compromise on the quality and taste like this.

Ambiance - 3/5

Their ice creams are simply the best ‚Äì fresh, flavorful, and made with natural ingredients that make every bite delightful. The highlight of my visit was trying their new Strawberry Sundae flavor. It was absolutely heavenly ‚Äì the perfect blend of creamy ice cream, fresh strawberries, and just the right amount of sweetness.

The outlet itself is clean and well-maintained, with friendly staff who ensure a smooth and pleasant experience. They even offer seating arrangements where you can relax and enjoy your ice cream. Naturals never fails to impress, and this new Strawberry Sundae flavor has made me love them even more. Highly recommend visiting this place if you‚Äôre in Virar."

I wanted customized cake as per my choice for my sister's baby shower, but since Monginis has just one default cake for baby shower, I agreed for the same one. The flavour of the cake was good. Just one thing that the upper layer tasted lil bitter, otherwise it was a very good cake overall. Thanks to the owner who took the order and placed it very smoothly without any hassle."

4,"The Post Office Restaurant & Bar is a perfect blend of great food, lively ambience, and top-notch service. Offering both veg and non-veg dishes, the menu is diverse and flavorful, with something for everyone. The starters are especially impressive, and the mains are well-portioned and delicious.

Whether you're craving Indian, Chinese, or continental, every dish is cooked to perfection with quality ingredients. The bar is well-stocked, and their signature cocktails are a must-try. The vibe is modern yet cozy, making it ideal for both casual hangouts and special evenings.

Service is prompt and friendly, adding to the overall experience. The only reason for holding back half a star is for slightly limited parking space, but everything else makes up for it.

Highly recommended for a fun and flavorful dining experience!"
5,"I recently visited Post Office Bistro and Bar in Virar, and it was a delightful experience! The ambiance seamlessly blends the charm of a vintage post office with a modern bistro atmosphere. The staff was attentive and welcoming, adding a personal touch to the dining experience.

The menu offers a diverse range of dishes, showcasing a fusion of flavors that cater to various tastes. I particularly enjoyed
Starter :
üåüDariyaganj tandoori
üåüChicken Schezwan chilly

Main course:
üåüChicken noodles
üåü Moraccan pilaf
- it was a perfect blend of creativity and deliciousness. The presentation of the food was impeccable, reflecting the attention to detail that defines this establishment.

The bar selection is extensive, featuring both classic and innovative cocktails. The mixologists here clearly know their craft, and I was impressed with the unique combinations they offered.

What truly sets this place apart is its commitment to customer satisfaction. The staff goes above and beyond to ensure you have a memorable time. The cozy seating areas provide an intimate setting for both small gatherings and more significant celebrations.

While the prices may be slightly higher than average, the overall experience justifies the cost. Post Office Bistro and Bar is more than a dining spot; it's an escape into a world where good food, great drinks, and warm hospitality come together. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking to enjoy a unique culinary journey in Virar."

Quantity & quality of food and beverages is very fresh, absolute worth of each penny spend on it.

They always keep laughing new dishes & drinks every now and then.

One must try the place."
1,"WORST DOMINOS OUTLET EVER

This is by far the worst experience I‚Äôve ever had at a Domino's. I ordered a Double Cheese Margherita (medium size), tacos, and coke, and the entire process was a nightmare.

The lady at the counter was incredibly rude and didn‚Äôt seem to care about customer service at all. The outlet's hygiene standards were terrible, and there was no proper provision for handwashing. They didn‚Äôt even have hand sanitizers or a wash basin outside the filthy washroom.

After waiting 15-20 minutes, they brought out a small pizza, despite us ordering a medium. We pointed out the mistake, and they made us wait another 15-20 minutes. When the pizza came the second time, it was just a regular pizza, not the Double Cheese Margherita we ordered.

For the third time, they finally brought the pizza out, and instead of an apology, the lady rudely placed it on the table without a word of politeness. She spoke to us in such a disrespectful and unprofessional manner, it was shocking.

Service, hygiene, and staff attitude at this outlet need serious improvement. If I could give it zero stars, I would. Avoid this place at all costs."""

1,"Food was good over here but unfortunately not the service. The staff over here is totally unprofessional... Today the staff name Shweta was at the counter... I received my order but partial so was calling her out multiple times but she didn't responded to me.  Not only her but every staff take too long time just to place order. After that we need to ask them thousands of times regarding order or else you have ro wait for 20-30 mins. And when customers ask about the problem they just have an excuse that ""THE SERVER IS DOWN, IT WILL TAKE TIME""."

It would be interesting to see how well the flavors complement each other and if the cake captures the essence of rasgulla. Overall, it sounds like a unique and potentially delicious treat!

""I wanted to provide feedback for the delivery person Mr Kaleem Shah who suggested the rasgulla-flavored cake. I really appreciated the recommendation, as it turned out to be a unique and delicious choice. Thank you for going above and beyond to make my experience enjoyable!""

The service was quick, which we really appreciated. However, the only thing that could be improved is the quantity ‚Äî we found the portion sizes to be quite small compared to expectations.

Still, taste-wise and service-wise, it was a satisfying visit."
3,"I tried paneer shawarma, and it was way too soggy and bland. I wouldn't recommend it. Instead, you might want to try chicken shawarma or any non-veg shawarma/frankie."
4,Visited there with family and all the veg and non veg items were good... Loved it üòã
4,Food taste is good but service is lil slow
4,The images says it all. No purpose of writing it out specially. Do visit for sure.
5,"Had a great experience at this outlet.
Would like to call out Aditya who was at the counter who assisted us in enhancing our order experience and guided us how we can combine our orders and some some bucks.
Shubham was also helpful. The staff is quite good.
The outlet is big and has a good occupancy.
Really had a great time."
5,"I had a great experience at this McDonald's outlet. The staff was extremely polite, friendly, and supportive. From the moment I walked in, I was welcomed with a warm smile, which made me feel very comfortable. The service was quick, efficient, and delivered with care. Even during busy hours, the staff remained calm and courteous. The outlet was very clean and well-maintained, creating a pleasant environment to enjoy a meal. Overall, I was highly impressed with their professionalism and hospitality. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for great service and a friendly atmosphere."
5,"This one is recent update to previous feedback..i frequent this place for coffee and as always today i m very happy with the tiny gesture by the staff of post it greeting on my coffee..checkout the picture ..that went from 2 star to 5 üòâtiny details make huge difference.

Often the server is down resulting in delays for processing order resulting in long wait time. The airconditioning on upper floor is not functioning many times.This virar west outlet need to improvise in many ways compared to its other outlets in nallasopara, vasai etc."
5,"I Order
02 Nos Combo Meal Spicy Chicken üçî Burger & Mocha  ‚òï  Coffee"
5,"Located next to BigBazaar and prior to Galleria, at the road junction is this McD.
Liked the recently launched self order app where in we can select of our choice and either pay there or at the counter giving us the option to select from the wide range along with the prices.
The ground floor is bit crowded, however the top is relatively les crowded hence the AC too is pretty cool on top especially during the summers. Definitely worth a visit."
5,"It is exactly what google asks you- "" an experience"". And a must have one.
If you are anywhere near Virar west- must give it a try.
I tried chicken bhujing regular. Good roasted chicken and aloo with poha. None of these ingredients are special but together with the masala they add- wow. The place a very clean and hygienic. Also the quantity is awesome. They measure the chicken and then add the aloo and poha.
An advice- try to reach early as their stock finishes fast.
Also, they make everything fresh and in front of you so be prepared to stand in a looooong queue. But the wait is worth it.
A must try place."
5,"There is no Bhujing that can beat ABC!
I have been visiting this place since last 10 years and taste have not changed one bit..

Their Chiken rassa is also amazing!"
1,Personal I don't like bhujing Bcz there lots of potatoes in it and sabji which is not necessary. Bcz they charge according to kilograms and personally I was looking for only chicken not sabji and potatoes which increases weight of complete bhujing packet. I think it shouldn't be there.
3,"Visit only if you want to try something different but do not expect too much, still they get out of stock before 8.30pm.
No sitting arrangements, only takeaway.
You can take a parcel and eat in a nearby restaurant by paying additional charges."
5,This place serves a dish called bhujing which is a rare dish preapred only @ this place in the whole world & not even any 7 star hotel can match the taste of this dish. The best chicken in the whole world. No dish is tastier then this.
1,Horrible experience! Pin in food.I am a Regular customer but this time found pin in my food which luckily got inserted between tooth gums and I did not swallow.The quality team should avoid stapled packaging food stuff in the kitchen.
4,"Lots of varieties of food items (both veg & non-veg). Price is cheaper and affordable.

Nice place to have food with friends and family."
5,"Good ambience, tasty food and friendly staff. They helped us arrange our daughter's birthday party in there small party hall with great pomp."
1,Very bad service The staff pintu does not behave well with the customers.
1,Food is not good service is good thank you for all   teams
5,We had ordered veg as well as chicken biryani and it was amazing in taste and quantity wise also. We have been ordering food from past 5-7 years from Saagara and the service is top notch always. The staff as well as the owners are down to earth
5,"A Biryani Lover‚Äôs Paradise!

This restaurant serves some of the best Biryanis in town, offering a variety of flavorful options, from Paneer to Chicken, Mutton, and Seafood. Each dish is perfectly spiced, with fragrant rice and tender ingredients. The ambiance is inviting, the service is great, and the portions are generous. Pair your Biryani with their refreshing raita or rich gravy for the ultimate experience. A must-visit for Biryani lovers!

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
5,Connected with Saagara‚Äôs since last 12 years and quality is same till now. They have changed so many places in these years but food quality and service is still the same and best in Virar. Would recommend everyone to visit this place and enjoy the tasty food out here .
5,The food quality and services are top class. They maintain cleanliness and take care of your need. Thank you for the best services I have ever gotten from any restaurant. Now your place become my entire family‚Äôs favorite place.

1,"I had buy pinapple and rainbow pastries both pastries are too sweet to eat , u can not eat it .ans sponge was also not perfectly cooked i felt like its waste of money .."
5,"This place is absolutely amazing, and the membership is truly worth every penny. Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt fully utilize it since my son is under 16 and isn‚Äôt eligible for certain benefits. However, for families with four members, the membership offers incredible value at an unbeatable price.

The swimming tutors here are exceptional! With consistent effort and dedication, they can help you learn to swim confidently in just 10 days. Their teaching methods are highly effective, ensuring every learner feels comfortable and empowered in the water. Although the pool could use more frequent water changes, the expertise, patience, and dedication of the tutors more than make up for it. Overall, it‚Äôs a fantastic place to learn swimming and a great investment in both fun and skill-building!"
1,"""Not Worth Staying ‚Äì Hygiene Issues, Unprofessional Service & Poor Facilities""

I stayed at this club recently, and while the exterior looks clean and well-maintained, the reality is far from that. The moment night falls, you‚Äôll be attacked by bed bugs, mosquitoes, and even flies in the bathroom. To make matters worse, the bathroom ceilings are damaged, and the rooms have an unpleasant odor. This place rates itself as a 4-star property, but honestly, it doesn‚Äôt even deserve 1 star.

Additionally, the service is abysmal. There was no one at the reception to receive or attend to guests when we arrived. The hotel was badly understaffed, with only 2 people managing the entire property. This is completely unacceptable for any hospitality business.

On a positive note, the food at Saffron Grill was decent, and the staff, though polite, couldn‚Äôt make up for the overall poor experience. I would not recommend staying here at all. It‚Äôs simply not worth the price or the hassle."
4,"We had a birthday party at the club one hotel. The ambience was amazing, we ordered both veg and non veg foods. Both foods were amazing and tasty. We started with mocktails and all the mocktails were so refreshing with amazing taste."
3,"A good place for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians.
The taste is okay.
It has a nice and peaceful ambiance.
There is ample parking available."""
2,The rooms were having foul smell when entered. Had to compulsorily run fans and ac together to wade off the smell. The key card was not working fine and had to try it multiple times to open the door. Wifi was very slow and the network was poor in the rooms and the lobby too. For the price paid the services were not upto the mark. The reception did not pick up the calls in some instances.
1,"Are you Guy's serving spoiled food to the customers...... It's so nonsense,

I have buy 1 chicken roll and 1 chicken burger,
When I given burger to my kid, he was like feeling so bed, when I tasted burger was spoil already......

You guys should not serve products untill night,  which you received in the morning.

Very very bad....if anyone from my family get effected by your product, I will scrue to whole your management,"
4,They very bad staff and service is very worst. Every time they  don't have any products what customer want. This very bad store compare to other store.
4,"Nice cake shop ,good ambiance ,good service"

1,I ordered fruit cake and chocolate truffle cake... The truffle was good but the fruit cake was the worst sour and tasteless  i got a food infection after having this cake.. I complained about the cake in store but still they don't revert.. i purchased this cake on 12 of may ...
1,"yesterday i had purchased a Red Velvet cake from Monginis, and it was an absolute disappointment. The cake was completely tasteless, and the quality was incredibly poor. It ruined our special occasion, and I deeply regret choosing Monginis. Save your money and time."
5,Great ambiance with good music also you can experience live music on Saturday n Sunday. Food quality is very good.
4,"We went on a Friday night & the restaurant was pretty empty. The ambience was nice and the food was good. We ordered squid with butter and garlic, chilli chicken and butter chicken along with a mojito which was alright. The pi√±a colada tasted better. The service was adequate."
4,"One of the best resto bar in Nalasopara Virar with open seating
Entrance is amazing ü§© with a chair ü™ë you can sit and click selfie
Plenty of parking outside
They have an upper deck with limited seating but it's worth
Open seating does not have an AC
There is a separate section with AC but it doesn't have live singing
Mostly on weekends they live singing

Must Visit"
4,"I recently visited Zeel, a family restaurant located just a 30-minute drive from Virar station with my family. While the restaurant is renowned for its fish dishes, I was a bit disappointed as the fish dishes I ordered (pomplet gravy and prawns starter) didn't meet my expectations. However, the Chicken Tandoori Lollypop was a standout and absolutely delicious. On the other hand, the Chicken Biryani tasted more like pulav, which was a letdown.

We ordered a total of 4-5 dishes, and the bill came to approximately 2500 rupees for three people. While the food was decentpan was the service and staff that truly shone. The attentive and friendly service added a positive note to our dining experience. Overall, Zeel is worth a visit for its warm hospitality, but I would recommend trying their chicken dishes over the fish options."
4,"Felt like good place, ample parking available, aesthetics and vibe was awesome. They even have live karaoke üé§ during sunday approx 8:30pm onwards. Food was good but was had given less rating as felt that should have been much better in terms of taste, quantity wise was very good."
1,Even after requesting for a cleaning the table was cleaned almost after 10mins. The person at the order counter was being a bit ride which is not acceptable in the hospitality industries.... Out of 4 stuff I requested 3 were not available from the menu.. the counter girl may be not happy with her job or paid less but she should not directly handle customers.....
3,"Tried Dominator but would suggest try Mojo's Double Trouble/Smokey Joeys for better bread, cheese and toppings of course."
1,"After 10 minutes of seating on the table , the previous order is still not cleared That's how this outlet works , pathetic."
3,"It's not worth it. Topping is less compared to veg ones.

1 star for the outlet and staff. (Dine-in)

Delivery review: requested the guy to bring extra oregano and flakes. This time I ordered the veg one."
1,Order hot and fiery cheesiken and got this !!! And store phone no. Is switched off ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨

2. Chicken cheese momos - 65/- (3pieces)

Both the momos quality was good and taste was also good. Kurkure momos size was quite big and that was so crispy and they might be add extra masalas on momos for that spicy taste.
Cheese momos taste wasn't that wow, but yes the taste was good.

Suggestion:
Half plate option must be there as if someone wants to repeat a dish he/she will not be able to eat the whole plate 6pcs of momos. so option of 3pcs should be there at least for dine in."

3,"If you are from Lokhandwala Andheri you have probably ordered from here or crossed this place however let me tell you what I feel about this place which is in one of the most prime locations in the market. The food is good, whenever you order make sure to say ""please make it well done"" they will add cheese and toppings properly. On a budget - Get the corn with Paprika. Chicken lover.. Get a chicken dominator. Don't waste money on a stuffed garlic bread, the original one with a cheese dip is simply heaven. The roasted chicken wings in hot sauce is worth trying. You can honestly avoid the pastas and the choco lava is a hands down winner. To the management I recommend please redo your place and have at least some seating. There are only a handful of restaurants in Lokhandwala and now with Pizza Hut shut you should really consider dine-in option in the vicinity."
1,"Poor quality, burnt food. Burger pizza. Pizza where also burnt and dried out"
2,"Dear Domino‚Äôs Team,

I am writing to formally raise a complaint regarding the continuous delay in the delivery of my orders over the past 15 days. I am a resident of Andheri West, Versova, and every day, your outlet has been delivering my order after 1.5 to 2 hours, despite the standard delivery time being 30 minutes.

Most recently, my order with Order Number: 181 has not been delivered even after 2 hours of placing it. This is completely unacceptable and reflects poor service quality. Moreover, your team has consistently failed to respond promptly or provide any satisfactory resolution when contacted.

This is a clear violation of your promised service standards, and I am requesting the following:

An explanation and apology for the repeated delays.

A fine or compensation, as per Domino‚Äôs delivery policy.

Assurance of improved delivery time in the future or escalation to higher management.

If this issue is not addressed promptly, I will be compelled to report this to the Consumer Forum and relevant Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) authorities for poor service and neglect of consumer rights.

Please treat this matter with urgency and respond within 48 hours."
1,"This Domino‚Äôs outlet is in terrible condition. No AC, no staff at the counter, and when they finally show up, they‚Äôre rude.

While waiting, I overheard staff harassing a customer over an online order, refusing to deliver it, and even joking about eating the pizza themselves. Completely unprofessional!

As for my own order‚Äîthe pizza had a weird creamish liquid on top. No idea what it was, but it looked questionable and completely ruined my appetite.

Avoid this place. Dirty, unprofessional, and downright suspicious. Domino‚Äôs needs to fix this immediately!"
2,"One of the worst dominos pizza place. They Don't have  place to sit inside. And if you sit out, beggars ask you for food and money, which is really annoying when you are having a conversation with someone and they start begging and even touch your shoulders. It was a very bad experience. We packed our food and went to juhu beach to eat it.

Food: 7/10 (they delay most of the time)
Atmosphere: 0/10
Service: 4/10 (some of the staff are rude)"
5,"First of all special thanks to the amazing staff and especially to JOSEPH. He made sure we were comfortable and is an amazing guy. Joseph you are awesome !!!!!!!!

Secondly NICOLE, she manages the karaoke so awesome. You rock Nicole

Now with the review. If you need to de-stress, sing to amazing tracks, drink and just have fun, this is the place to go. Sunday Drunch is fantastic. Unlimited drinks and limited good food. Tha ambience is awesome gives you the Spanish Villa / Goan feel. Sit outside and after you are few drinks down and in second or third gear, head inside and just enjoy, dance, sing, and have awesome time. We had a gala of time, had fun with total strangers. Surely going back again. Just one small thing to note is that zomato and swiggy dineouts dont apply to Sunday drunch."
4,"A lively open bar with great food, drinks, and a buzzing crowd. The vibe is cool, and pricing is fair for the location. Seating fills up fast, so expect a wait. A foosball table adds to the fun, but service is just average. Still, a solid spot for a night out!"
5,"I have been coming to The Little Door for years and it never fails to impress. Whether its their cocktails, food, music, service, everything is top notch.
Their brunch is another favorite.
The ambiance is mediterain with white washed walls and blue door and windows.

Here are my favorite picks
Food
Any of the pizzas (INR 500 onwards)
Burrata Spaghetti (INR 500 onwards)
Bruscetta
Assorted vegetables in Italian Herbs (we order this on repeat)

Service: 5/5
Value for Money- 4/5"
5,"Has always been one of my favourite places to eat at, especially in the evenings and night!
They have an outdoor sitting area that‚Äôs beautifully decorated with lights.
The indoor area is smaller but very cozy and comfortable!
The service is impeccable and the waiters are very polite too!
Chicken starters are excellent!
Amazing place to grab a drink or dine with friends :)"
5,Love the food the ambiance evey thing was just perfect also the staff are helpful pick the dishes can‚Äôt wait to go back to this place

.
.
‚óæWe have tried different types of pastries here.The interior architecture of the cake shop is also cool and the ambience also good.Here you will find freshly baked foods.There are a lot of different foods here too, definitely try them.
.
.
The only thing that bothers them is the way they talk and behave they should definitely improve it.
.
.
But for the rest, Monginis is cool.So guys ho and try it."
3,"Monginis is a widespread cake shop chain with multiple outlets throughout the city.
It serves numerous bakery items from cakes to patties/rolls.
The prices of pastries / cakes is as par with other reputed cake shops whereas the quality is not up to the mark.
I do not prefer monginis unless all usual options are unavailable."
2,"Dear Monginis Team,

I am writing to express my profound disappointment regarding the recent experience my family and I had with your services.

As longstanding customers of Monginis, we have always trusted your brand to provide quality cakes for our special occasions. However, during our son's birthday party, we encountered a distressing incident. A hair strand was found embedded in the central part of the cake, not on the surface. This discovery was deeply upsetting and marred what should have been a joyful celebration with our closest relatives.

Following this unfortunate incident, I made several attempts to contact the shopkeeper via calls and messages to address the issue, but received no response. Frustrated, I visited the shop in person to express my concerns. Despite showing evidence of my attempts to reach out, I was met with indifference. The shopkeeper claimed to have been absent during my calls, but there was no acknowledgment or apology for the oversight.

As loyal customers, we did not request a replacement cake; we simply hoped for an apology and reassurance that such incidents would be prevented in the future. Unfortunately, neither the shopkeeper nor Monginis has extended any form of apology for the inconvenience caused.

It is with a heavy heart that I must inform you that we have decided to discontinue our patronage of Monginis. We hold your brand in high esteem within the cake market, and we never anticipated such disappointing treatment of loyal customers.

I share this experience not out of malice but with the hope that it will prompt Monginis to re-evaluate its customer service practices and prioritize the satisfaction of its customers, especially those who have supported the brand for years."
4,So this one is really good shop to get cake as there are not many cake shop here. So it‚Äôs budget friendly and also nice taste.
2,Quality food drastically decreased cake is totally over sweet cake quality is ok don't purchase chocolate cake because chocolate is over sweet they now increased creame level in creme
4,"**A Flavorsome Journey at Mainland China, Marred by Service Hiccups**

Mainland China has long been synonymous with exquisite flavors, but our recent visit left us with mixed feelings. While the food was undeniably stellar, the service fell short of expectations. Upon arrival, we noticed that another group, which came in after us, was promptly served their starters while we were left waiting. This preferential treatment was both puzzling and disappointing, as it was the first time we had encountered such an issue here.

However, once the food did arrive, it was a true testament to the culinary artistry that Mainland China is known for. We began with the **Kimchi and Chicken Salad**, a refreshing medley of crisp greens and tender chicken, with the sharp tang of kimchi adding a vibrant contrast. Next came the **Corn and Water Chestnut Dumplings**, delightfully delicate with a satisfying crunch from the water chestnuts. The **Shrimp Dumplings** were silky and succulent, bursting with oceanic sweetness, while the **Basil-Flavored Chicken Dumplings** carried a beautifully herbaceous aroma that lingered on the palate.

The **Drums of Heaven Hong Kong Style** arrived next, and while the texture was spot-on‚Äîcrispy on the outside and juicy inside‚Äîthe sweetness of the sauce was slightly overpowering for my taste. The **Fish in Soy Chilli Garlic** was an absolute standout, the tender fish absorbing the deep umami of soy, the heat of chili, and the warmth of garlic in perfect harmony.

Moving on to the main course, the **Lotus Stem, Asparagus, and Pakchoy in Chilli Basil Sauce** was a delightful combination of crunch, spice, and fresh, earthy flavors. The **Corn and Potato in Hosing Hoy Style** was equally delicious, offering a balance of sweetness and savoriness. The **Shrimps in Black Pepper Sauce** brought a bold kick of heat, perfectly complementing the seafood‚Äôs natural sweetness.

Accompanying these dishes, the **Vegetable and Burnt Garlic Fried Rice with Chicken** had just the right amount of smokiness, while the **Wok-Tossed Chicken Hakka Noodles** were light yet flavorful, providing the perfect vehicle for the rich sauces of the main dishes.

Dessert was the perfect ending to our meal. The **Honey Noodles with Vanilla Ice Cream** were a delightful play on textures, with crispy, caramelized noodles meeting the cool, velvety smoothness of the ice cream. The **Mango Souffl√©** was airy, luscious, and packed with the tropical sweetness of ripe mangoes‚Äîa true showstopper.

While the ambience was warm and inviting, the **service left much to be desired**. A restaurant of this caliber should ensure that every guest receives equal attention and timely service. Despite the initial disappointment, the food lived up to expectations, making it a place worth visiting‚Äî**if only the service matched the excellence of the cuisine**."
5,"My family recently decided to indulge in Mainland China's buffet and ended up having a spectacular time. It was a truly delightful culinary experience from start to finish.

The journey began with a range of mouth-watering appetizers that immediately set the tone. We sipped on piping hot Veg Hot & Sour Soup and Chicken Sweet Corn Soup‚Äîboth bursting with rich flavors. The Chicken Basil Dumplings were tender, juicy, and fragrant with fresh basil, while the Vegetarian Dumplings was filled with finely chopped veggies. There was Crispy Vegetables and Cottage Cheese Soya Chilli Garlic which was a standout among the vegetarian starters, offering a perfect balance of spice and umami. Among the non-vegetarian options, Chicken Hunan Style brought bold flavors with a hint of smokiness, and the Fish Pepper Garlic had a deliciously crisp texture and we just couldn't resist having more of it.

For add-on beverages, we went with a Classic Mojito, a Peach Iced Tea and a Fresh Lime Soda.

Moving on to the mains, we enjoyed a generous spread including Wok Tossed Hakka Noodles, Chicken Fried Rice, and Fish in Green Garlic Sauce. The Smoked Chilli Chicken packed a punch, and the Prawns in Singaporean Chilli Sauce were perfectly cooked and coated in a spicy-sweet glaze.

To end on a sweet note, the dessert spread featured brownies, honey noodles, mousse, pastry, fresh fruits, custard, and ice cream‚Äîa heavenly variety for any sweet tooth. Really enjoyed the brownie and the mousse.

Overall, the buffet at Mainland China absolutely lives up to its reputation, offering a well-rounded fine dine experience. This was the third time I visited the Mainland China buffet in Veera Desai and wasn't disappointed at all."
5,"Delicious indo-chinese food. Was here on a Sunday after many years. I was offered two options: order A-la-carte or a fixed brunch menu (unlimited food for ‚Çπ1400). Went with the brunch menu and I got to try a bunch of different appetisers and entrees.

Loved the lemongrass cheesecake which was basically a cheesecake with subtle hints of lemongrass.

Great service by Dinesh, Abhishek (team led by Mr Sunil).

Definitely recommend if you are craving indo-chinese food in Mumbai."
4,"I had an amazing dining experience at Mainland China. From the moment we walked in, the ambience was absolutely beautiful‚Äîelegantly decorated with warm lighting and a cozy, welcoming vibe.
The food was incredibly authentic, full of rich flavors and clearly made with care and high-quality ingredients.
What really made the night special, though, was the excellent service. The staff were attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable, making sure we felt taken care of from start to finish.
Highly recommend this spot for anyone looking to enjoy a memorable meal in a stunning setting!"
4,"This place has been around for ages so needs no introduction but I guess they've added new things to their menu from last time. Anyway, I'd say overall the meal experience was alright, not too special. They got a 4 rating because their prawns Cheng fun was amazing, it's fun to watch soy being poured over the hot dish.
The paneer in the paneer chilli was not good, tasted a little too off, flavour was all just in the coating.
The veg burnt garlic rice was absolute nonsense. Hardly any burnt garlic, what even is the point.
The lamb chilli wasn't so bad, worth a shot I guess.
Chicken chilli gravy was spectacular.  No doubt about it. So was the Exotic vegetable 1, I forgot to click a picture of it but it has a really good gravy.
I think if the rice and paneer didn't ruin the experience, overall the food would've been perfect."
1,"We were 9 people went for dinner on friday 17 dec 21.
next day all 9 of us were suffering from vomiting, nuasea, fever. Same day i saw a similar review on zomato by some body else also. I went along with my bill to meet them, but there was no response. from this it was very clear that the food quality was sub standard, old preservative food was provided which led sickness for all of us. I am sure on that particular day may would have suffered the same."
1,"I Visited with my family and was served Non veg food, inspite of the fact i told am vegetarian.
Pics attached for your reference.
The real offence was what happened after that.
1) The server felt it was OK
2) The manager couldn't say anything beyond Sorry
I asked for Mr Anja's mail id to raise the issue and what i got  he is in London we cant do any thing.
3) Then there was a guy called Pawar he was real Fraud. He kept us waiting on call for 30 mins and when no one was bothered to take care of situation.
Deeply offended how no one at your restaurant felt ashamed or sorry , for them it was normal course of business."
1,"Myself and my family had very horrible experience in mainland china Aundh pune on 9th may,2017..the food which was served to us was rotten and contaminated..The vegetables gravy which we ordered was badly smelling and we couldn't swallowed a single bite..strongly not recommending anyone to visit mainland china. If you love your family..Because it can harm your health of your near and dear ones..."
3,Rarely a Chinese restaurant run by an Indian company gives you that satisfaction. I like it here
5,I visited restaurants with my family the food is awesome üëçüëç
4,"Decent, Cost convenient, Viable option for a treat.

Pros:
1. Location of the cafe / restaurant is at a pretty convenient place on the main road. Easy to navigate.
2. Ambience is good for families in AC Hall.
3. Service is decent, polite staff, quick.
4. Price is not too inflated, so reasonable.

Cons:
1. The taste or quality is satisfactory I would say. Not the best, but not bad either. However, should count as a con.
2. Parking space is limited since it is on main road. Two wheeler would be best option to reach here.
3. The design may look slightly congested to a claustrophobic person. So, heads up for it. And maybe heads down since the ceiling is of less height.

Anyway, as mentioned above, Decent, Cost convenient, Viable option for a treat."
1,"Today we visited Caf√© Alif, your restaurant, and ordered Lemon Chicken Tandoori, Dilkhush Tikka, Chicken Golden Gravy, Butter Naan, and Veg Fried Rice. Despite ordering so much, not a single dish had any taste the quality was third class. The butter naan was not even cooked properly. Overall, the food was terrible.

I have been eating at your restaurant for the past 3 to 4 years, so I can easily tell the difference between how the food used to taste earlier and how it tastes now. After your renovation, I have visited twice, but the food quality remains the same  poor. You may have renovated the place, but the food quality has dropped drastically.

I am extremely disappointed. On top of that, when we complained to your staff, instead of acknowledging the issue, they started giving us explanations like, ""This is how the food is supposed to be, this is how it tastes, and this is how it‚Äôs made."" I am deeply disappointed with both your service and food.

This was our last visit we won‚Äôt be coming back again."
5,Great food and very much affordable. If you are in jogeshwari west I would definitely recommend trying this place at least once
5,"Well this place is affordable

1,"My relative brought Roasted Almond 500 g pack from your Jogeshwari West outlet on 31st March.  My observations are as under:
1.  The taste is watery.
2.  Getting smell & taste of milk like a product from dugdhalaya at the street corner.
3.  Shelf life is only 15 days as against 60 days in other brands.
4.  6 days old package.  With limited shelf life, fresh or at the most 1 day old package should have been given.

Have been your patron for several years.  Request not to dilute your standards."
5,Great taste with affordable prices ‚ù§Ô∏è
5,"I recently visited Natural Ice Cream- Jogeshwari outlet.
As usual, this place has freshness like their Ice creams.
They have all seasonal fruits Ice creams in option.
In morning, it was not crowded. We enjoyed Black grapes and Gajar ka halwa flavours.

Both were fresh and yummy. It is hygienic and safe place to have freshly churned ice creams.
I recommend this place to all Ice Cream lovers.
5 Star Rating"
3,"The icecream parlour was quite small but the vibe was good.
personally I don't like naturals ice cream that much except for the tender coconut flavour but this time I tried other and they were okok..I felt like I wasted my money but also it depends on everyone's taste buds...if u like there icecreams then u can go visit and have itüëçüèª"

1,"During fasting month i do recommend many people to have taste of Chi. Roll from skyway only. The taste was good untill 2023 Ramzan. In the previous year 2024 the taste was quite ok. But for this year 2025, the taste seems like a street food, not worthy"
5,"Went at 09:00 p.m. easily got the place. Like ambiance, service is quick, mouthwatering test & exact quantity.

5,"If you're on the lookout for a budget-friendly dining option that doesn't compromise on flavor, Safar  might just be your next favorite spot.

Ambiance:
The decor is typical rajasthani chiliya  set up , but its good neat & clean well maintained ...

Menu:
Safar boasts a diverse menu,
From  appetizers to main courses, there's something for everyone. The prices are surprisingly reasonable, with most dishes falling well within the budget-friendly range.

Overall Experience:
Safar is a fantastic option for anyone looking to enjoy a delicious meal"
4,"I‚Äôve visited Cafe Safar in Andheri three times, and here‚Äôs my experience.

The Chicken Chilli is perfect for those who enjoy Chinese-style dishes‚Äîspicy and flavorful.

The Chicken Crispy was also great‚Äîcrispy, spicy, and full of taste.

Chicken Fried Rice and Chicken Lollipop with sauce weren‚Äôt very spicy but tasted good and came in good quantity.

The plain Chicken Lollipop was hot and crispy, though a bit chewy inside.

The Mix Platter comes with 10 pieces of 4 types of tikka and kebab. Since we didn‚Äôt want kebabs, we asked to change them. The staff said we could swap within the four tikkas included, without extra charge, or choose other tikkas from the menu with an extra cost. It‚Äôs nice that they allow some customization.

The Chicken Biryani and Cafe Safar Special Falooda were okay.

They don‚Äôt have many cold drink options, but besides their ice cream menu, they also have some extra ice creams stored in the fridge.

Overall: A good place for spicy starters and decent food. Worth visiting if you're nearby."
4,"The quantity provided could be more as for the price we pay I feel the quantity is less. Also packaging they need to pay attention. The butter chicken was already half spilled out of the container.
However, the desserts are very good. The Rabdi is heavenly, thick and lacchedar. The Carame custard is light and yummy. Gulab jamun waa a lil hard but it did taste good. Cut one star for the quantity aspect only"
4,I've been ordering from this place from Swiggy and Zomato and always enjoyed their preparation. So yesterday when I was around Oshiwara I came across this restaurant and felt like experiencing the dinning in. To be honest this place did not disappoint me even while dining in. The service was prompt the food was served extremely fast and even the ambience was pleasant. It has 3 sections (Ac - Non AC and another separate section). The restaurant is quite spacious and a separate large waiting area with chairs. Also very reasonably priced with a wide variety of cuisine. Overall a favorable experience.
5,Delicious food. Attentive service from staff. Got the meat platter and mug sallum. Probably spelling it wrong. I definately recommend to anyone.
4,"Nice chilli cheese sandwich and activity sandwich.
Activity toast is similar to the masala sandwiches you get outside, just not as good.
Chilli cheese toast was damn good.
The green chutney was too salty but the  chilli sauce was awesome.
Note: If you buy extra ketchup, they'll send the no onion no garlic one."
5,"Their Indie-mexican sandwich is to die for. Oozing with cheese and veggies it's a complete meal. In fact, I had to share the sandwich with my friend. And believe me  it took the two of us to finish it. I also love the coffee  milkshake. Service is prompt and courteous too."
4,"The veg cheese grilled sandwich was loaded with the ingredients of veggies, masala & cheese in just the right way. Absolutely perfect and the cold beverage too. Only small suggestion would be to maybe add a bit of salt in the red chutney/sauce as it was too spicy. Everything else other than was great"
5,One of the best place for sandwiches around the lokhandwala area since many years.the food is always fresh and with good quality.my favourites are maha veggie cheese sandwich and activity toast sandwich.they serve with spicy green chutney and red garlic chutney.parcel order comes with good packaging.they also have other stores in different locations.definitely worth the money.
4,"A go-to place in Santa Cruz since it was Swastik sandwich. And then they opened below our house. Just a call away.

Quite regular but the last year has been tough so we also avoided. The other day checked and delivery was ‚Çπ 47 + 15 tip + taxes. So called the store directly and they delivered.

Grill sandwich, Mayo sandwich, Aloo masala toast is the family favourite."
5,‚ÄòOh so lovely‚Äô everything about this restaurant.. food is delicious and they have outside and inside seating. I opted for outside which is cool n nice. The staff is friendly and explained new dishes. I had salmon avocado salad which had good portion. And then I had pork belly chops which was tender n melting. The prices are at little high but worth. Overall experience was lovely and would love to visit again!
4,"The staff is very sweet and accommodating, it was too cold indoors so we moved outdoors. So we got options from the Festive menu, the lamb shepherd's pie ü•ß and the gnocchi. The Shepherd's pie was satisfying and wholesome, however the gnocchi was a bit too pasty instead of pillowy.

We also ordered some calamari rings and Lotus stem chips for our appetizers which were absolutely yummyüòã Overall the meal was a great start to the New Year."
4,"Enjoyed the evening at Woodside Inn to celebrate the return of my merchant navy friend. Though relatively small, the restaurant appears and feels both comfortable and cozy. Subdued lighting and not to loud music made talking amongst us easy.
Drinks are priced on the higher side but we could get some advantage of the happy hours (upto 8PM). Food was really good. We were greatly satiated with the slow cooked pork. Grilled Harissa chicken was good too.
Liked the friendly service. Our charges can‚Äôt to INR 2,700 per person.
All in all we enjoyed our evening."
5,Woodside Inn never disappoints! This outlet in Andheri has a similar cosy ambience as it's cousin Fort outlet. As always we started with their Onion Rings which are arguably one of the best in the business. We then ordered Balkan Blast Burger from their Burger Festival menu. It had a herbed lamb patty with caramelized onions put inside lightly toasted buns with no overload of sauces. It was amazing as expected. I love their less is more philosophy while making burgers. They continue to be one of the best places to have a burger in Mumbai. We also had Light Lunch Pizza which was a thin crust pizza with pesto on it and it was great as well. Bruschetta was 10/10 as well. Prices are slightly on the higher side but it comes with consistency in quality and good service. We'll definitely be back!
5,"Absolutely loved the food. Ordered the Grilled Harissa Chicken Skewers which was really flavorful, and for the main course had the Butter Garlic Prawns & Edamame Risotto, Grilled Rawas, and the Pesto Chicken Pizza all of which were amazing especially the grilled Rawas as it was really soft and complemented the sauce well. And to top it off, the Belgian chocolate Torte was really delicious too. Loved the presentation! Would definitely recommend."
3,"Fire Bowl is a relaxed little spot in Lokhandwala, specializing in Indian Chinese cuisine, perfect for a small gathering of up to six people. With a simple yet pleasant ambience, it‚Äôs a comfortable place to enjoy a casual meal with friends or family. Be prepared for a bit of a wait, typically around 20-25 minutes, as the seating is limited and the place is often in demand.

The food here is decent, though not groundbreaking. Portions are satisfying, and while the flavours are enjoyable, they may not leave a lasting impression. The pricing is a bit on the higher side, so keep that in mind when planning your outing.

One area for improvement is the service. During my visit, there were only 2-3 waiters on hand, which slowed things down, particularly during peak hours. That said, the staff members were polite, friendly, and professional, making the experience pleasant despite the slight delay.

Overall, Fire Bowl is a good spot if you‚Äôre looking for a relaxed meal with decent Indian Chinese options, but be ready for a wait and moderate service times."
4,"Awesome food!
Decent service.
So so atmosphere.

Maybe playing chinese/tibetan music would improve the experience of the customers coming their and immerse them in the culture more!

Overall, definately a worth place to try."
4,"I am frequent eater of fire bowl.. yesterday we had order pot rice
It was damn tasty but they provide salad of cucumber..i had taken delivery of pot rice
According to them they dont provide salad in delivery. Its good brand but i feel this is not good for your restaurant if some one is loving something then you should provide on delivery as well..given 3 star as you didnt provided me.."
2,We had ordered gravy dish and received dry. We called and informed but there was no help offered other than sorry and phone was disconnected. Taste was also very ok compared to what we usually eat there. I am a regular customer but this time very disappointed with food and service both
2,I've visited this place before about a few years ago but now it's a disaster. The taste of the food and quality is deteriorated. The entire experience was unpleasant. The waiters attitude was I don't give a fan kinda. The food quantity was good but what do I do with so much food if I don't like the taste.
4,"The CCD in Andheri offers a comfortable and relaxing ambiance, perfect for catching up with friends or working on the go. The caf√© is spacious, with ample seating and a cozy atmosphere. Their coffee menu is extensive, offering everything from classic cappuccinos to their signature cold brews. The food options are varied, with tasty snacks like sandwiches and desserts to complement your drinks. The staff is courteous and efficient, ensuring quick service. It's an ideal spot for coffee lovers and casual meetings alike."
1,The staff doesn‚Äôt allow to sit ‚Ä¶he came again n again with the menu to order‚Ä¶that was very annoying‚Ä¶caf√©s like Starbucks ccds are build up on concept of sitting for longer hours ‚Ä¶chilling and then ordering if we feel like‚Ä¶the old man is really pathetic ‚Ä¶disappointing seriously üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°
5,"Really great place to work, chill now very few CCDs are left to visit guys they are great the taste of coffee,cold coffee is the best ."
5,Superstar review for Faruq a Guy who keeps his head down and keeps working sometimes alone even doubles up as a one man team.Often observed him keeping customer needs first always working with a smile.I have seen very very few people in customer service who work this sincerely and with this much of professionalism.Hence a long and specific review for him.Joining Ccd app as he suggested.Guys like him deserve to be appreciated by management.
4,"This outlet of CCD is decent. With a few tables spread out Atmosphere is fine, but the music seems to be a bit loud for sitting inside and having conversations l, though they do adjust the volume it seems or you get used to the loud sound is hard to say :)"
3,"We went to Malgudi for some light dinner:

1) Food:

We ordered Dosa(butter), Uttapam(onion) and Fountain Marinda.
Dosa was made in butter and it was heavy to digest, though tasty.
Aloo was served seperately with Dosa.

Uttapam: was more like a bread. Not at all recommended. You can have idea about the same in the pics,

Fountain Mirinda: was expecting this to be served like old ways but got it in other way.

2) Ambience:

It is in food court, so u can expect less sitting and look for the vacant chairs to enjoy food

3) Service:

Food was served in mins, so good part.

4) Price:

High on price.

Overall: a ok2 place"
4,Some south Indian delicasy I had today at malgudi. The order was easy to b placed.The Mgr at t counter served mi the menu n politely placed the order. Told mi it would take 5 mins. As I came back after 5 mins my order was ready .ordered the mysore masala dosa which came with a tasty sambar a green spicy n a red tangy tomato chutney. All tasted well only it wasn't warm.
1,I had ordered plain dosa and after wating for a long time they gave dosa which was cold. Had asked to change so they acted like reheating the dosa and served me the same dosa. Inspite of paying money and waiting was not able to eat it plus the service was also not good. They don't even talk properly. Highly disappointed by MALGUDI SIMPLY SOUTH (ANDHERI WEST)
3,Had a light lunch here in the Growel mall outlet. They portion of idli plate was very small. They gave 2 small idlis and charged Rs. 165. Taste is good but quantity should have been minimum 3 idlis for the rate they are charging. Their service is also slow.
1,"I am right now in Infinity Mall and I ordered for Tea from Malgudi. The tea was not brewed well, not boiled enough. When I went to return the tea in exchange, the person at the counter made angry faces and gave me the same half cooked tea again. Please check on the quality of the food and your kitchen staff and please ask the counter guy to be polite with customers"
5,"I just love this place. I have been a frequent to this place in the past 6 months. Their cocktails are just awesome. The bartender Ashok is excellent in his mixes. Food is just amazing. Everytime I go, I order something different and I am never dissapointed. Their manager Patil is very polite and humble. I see the owner many a times in the evening around, but did not get a chance to associate with him. I guess, because he has focus on the place that is why they maintain their standard. Good job team Alfredo."
3,"I visited Alfredo‚Äôs around 3 pm and found the place completely empty, offering a serene atmosphere. Opting for baked nachos, veggie pizza, and hot chocolate, I found the latter a tad too sweet for my palate, while the baked nachos pleasantly surprised with their irresistible flavor and perfect crispiness. However, the veggie pizza fell short due to its soft and thick crust, lacking the desired crispiness. Nonetheless, the staff's remarkable cooperation and immediate attention to all my requests truly elevated the experience. The restaurant boasts charming seating arrangements, including outdoor, indoor, and a top-floor option, each exuding its unique charm. Despite minor shortcomings, my overall visit to Alfredo‚Äôs was delightful, offering a cozy ambiance, delicious food, and exceptional service."
5,"Went to Alfredos after a movie, it was perfect as it's right next to PVR. It has such a good vibe and food was amazing! Carbonara fettuccine was really good, the sauce was too good. Also ordered Sicilian garlic chicken to go with beers and it was super juicy! Loved it and would like to come again"
4,"Alfredo‚Äôs has been my go-to pub-bar for years. I moved to Mumbai in the late nineties  and the Alfredo‚Äôs Juhu was my first pub experience in Mumbai! (Alfdredo‚Äôs is till in Juhu but in a different location).
Alfredo‚Äôs Andheri is close to my home. This trip was a sudden, last minute plan and here we are at noon!
The food here is good - more continental/Mexican cuisines - though they have Asian food too. My favourite is the butter chicken nacho. This time we went for the chicken Caesar salad which went well with the beers.
Location is great - just below the new metro station. They have outdoor seating too that is popular in the evenings.
Till next time‚Ä¶.."

5,"Delicious food , good service"
3,"Good Kannad food with very helpful and courteous service. Menu is extensive and reasonably priced. Bakery section contains some classics, like potato bun, coconut crunch. Establishment is reasonably clean and crowded by patrons. The restaurant is open air service that can become excessively hot due heat from the kitchen, immediate need to improve on the ventilation."
5,"Love benne dosa. Chutney sauce is delicious. Also tried poha n uma, very tasty."
5,"Good experience
Specialist for South Indian food
Mysore Malasa Dosa is best there. You should try..."
5,My all time favourite place. This place is more than a bakery to me. Rawa cake here is divine and I knew Iyengar bakery only and only for its Rawa cake.. oh so mouth melting. Variety of freshly baked cakes options are available and all are yummilicious depending on ur taste buds. Many more snacking options also available here.  Courteous people and always smiling. Pocket friendly prices. I do not forget to pack the cakes as and when I pass this place. I have to rush to this place as my mouth is watering while writing this review. üòãüòãüòã what are u waiting for? Go grab your bite üòãüòã
5,"I have always had a very pleasant experience at this place, the people are very hospitable, Suraj has been very helpful in getting my order placed & making sure I have a everything I need when at the resturant. Home delivery is fast & FREE, clean food & overall a solid recommendation for anyone looking for clean, fresh & reasonably priced food!!@"
4,"Their meat meals are just too damn good. They have mutton, chicken, fish as well as some vegetarian dishes. Primarily being a Muslim venture, you're obviously bound to have a great non vegetarian meal. A great value for money restaurant."
1,I ordered from Swiggy that‚Äôs the worst food I ate in my life 1 piece of chicken not cooked gravy daal roti and rice never gonna order again shit food üò°

1,"From crispy to catastrophic.

I ordered the Crispy Chicken from Markaz, and what I got was a soggy, stale disaster that tasted like it had been sitting out since yesterday. Absolutely no crunch, no freshness ‚Äî just a limp, greasy mess.

And for ‚Çπ260? You‚Äôve got to be kidding me. That‚Äôs not just disappointing, it‚Äôs blatant overcharging for subpar, leftover-quality food.

Markaz, you seriously need to get your act together. This was the last time I‚Äôm trusting you with my order.
One word: AVOID."
5,"Hands down, one of the best dining experiences I've ever had! The ambiance is elegant, the service is top-notch, and the food... oh, the food! The chef's expertise shines through in every dish, and the presentation is stunning. I had the most tender and juicy chicken tikka masala, and the garlic naan was crispy perfection. Highly recommend the seafood platter, too - the prawns were succulent and flavorful. Can't wait to come back and try more of the menu!""

""I recently visited this restaurant and was blown away by the excellent ambiance and friendly staff. The moment I stepped inside, I was struck by the warm and inviting atmosphere. The d√©cor was modern and sleek, with comfortable seating areas that made me feel right at home. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable, happy to answer all our questions about the menu. The staff were prompt and efficient, ensuring that our food and drinks arrived quickly and with a smile. Overall, I had a fantastic experience and can't wait to go back!"""
1,"I have visited restaurants for my birthday party dinner we have ordered some food the taste is bad food wasn‚Äôt cooked properly even after informing the same to floor manager there wasn‚Äôt any solution  to our issues we are a regular customer since a long time and this restaurant got recently renovated after a long time ambience is nice but the most important thing the food taste and quality are not great anymore .
We won‚Äôt come back again"
4,"I recently ordered Veg Crispy and Veg Manchurian Gravy from Markaz Restaurant in Jogeshwari. While the Veg Crispy unfortunately became soggy during delivery, the Veg Manchurian Gravy was a highlight. The Manchurian pieces were well-cooked and generously sized, with a flavorful, tangy gravy that complemented them perfectly. Despite the mishap with the Veg Crispy, the Manchurian Gravy made the meal worthwhile."
1,"Hey everyone, I recently ordered the chicken Schezwan fried rice from Markaz, but unfortunately, I found a cockroach in my meal. üò± It was a really disappointing experience and not something you want to encounter when enjoying your food. I hope the restaurant takes this feedback seriously and improves their food quality and hygiene measures. Just wanted to share my honest experience so others can make informed choices. üôè"""
1,The food taste is so yucky and did vomiting after eating. They even don't care about packing.

The place is classy and best in the areai have shared pica of the caramel vustord that i had.. Servie is also the best.. The thing that i like about the place is that women feel free to join in at the restraunt inlike other restraunts in the area..

1,Bad experienced i ordered veg Biryani i found one chicken piece inside in veg Biryani vegetarian people's don't eat anything from cafe royal jogeshwari west behram baug third class restaurant 22.04.2019
1,"Food was stale and not upto the mark .I order through online platform and Chicken bhuna was smelling bad . Even the oil was bad quality .I tried reaching hotel for feedback but they were not available through online platform.

I ate food in Dubai outlets and was expectig the same quality and quantity. But it was a disappointing."
3,"With so much fame and reputation over the years . They really disappointed us. With poor quality and standard of chicken they serve. Ordered Platter worth rupees 835. But it was such a surprise. Came with14 pics chicken tikka pics. Not at all worth it .Chicken pic was not more than 50.grms small pic with no proper marination and wow factor was missing. It hardly came in salad plate that's it. It was not sufficient for 3 people. So ordered. Tandoori chicken which was again big bundler. FOR half Tandoori chicken charging 355. But y are you serving polio chicken with no mass in it only bone to it. HAVE eaten best Tandoori than this .I really wonder what is the hype about . Poor standard of meat .and quality plus zero customer satisfaction.
Yes but mutton briyani is wort trying.  Tender juicy mutton. And proper marination and authentic  Dum briyani  . Must try"
5,"Delhi Darbar is most famous restaurant in Mumbai Specially Jogeshwari, The name is justified with quality and service. You can find Many choices on Jogeshwari But Delhi Darbar have a different name and culture in food and service. Non-veg have many verity‚Äôs and options, family friendly and clean and hygiene, service also good. You can choose Delhi darbar for your family and friends."
1,"So I took away my Chicken Biryani at 12:30am, but later at home when I served it. It was having Mutton pieces in it, so I'm assuming they mixed both biryanis being the last batch of the day and gave it to me as single portion. Very bad first experience."
5,"Quick service, value for money and great consistent taste. We ordered Paneer & Veg kebab. Nihari, rotis and shahi tukda."

5,"Had a fantastic experience dining at The Delicacy of China in Oshiwara. The Chinese dishes here are absolutely delicious ‚Äî full of authentic flavors, fresh ingredients, and perfectly balanced spices. From the crispy starters to the flavorful mains, every bite was satisfying. Special mention to the Schezwan rice and the Kung Pao chicken ‚Äî they were spot on!

The service was equally impressive ‚Äî quick, polite, and attentive without being intrusive. The staff made sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed throughout our meal. Clean ambience and great quality food make this place a must-visit for anyone craving good Chinese in the area. Definitely coming back!"

The food is absolutely phenomenal! Every dish bursts with flavor, and you can taste the freshness in every bite. The Shanghai Soup and Chicken lollipop were perfectly crafted. The staff was attentive and friendly, making the whole experience even more enjoyable.

Delicacy of China is my new favorite spot! The food was fresh and full of flavor. The Korean rice was perfect and the chicken fingers were crispy and tender. The staff was super friendly, and the whole experience was great. I‚Äôll definitely be back for more! Highly recommend it!"
4,"Delicacy of China‚Ä¶.. impressed, with a delicious starter and a particularly yummy crispy chicken, showcasing mastery in crafting delightful dishes.

China Food's delicacy exceeded expectations.

The food was a delightful, offering a burst of flavors that set a high standard.

The crispy chicken, a standout dish, lived up to its promise of yumminess with its perfect balance of crunch and succulence."
5,"Superb food lovely taste and awesome biryani just loved the taste tried bheja masala it was good but not as expected and more on sweeter side roti was superb and crispy just awesome and full marks for dum biryani it was the highlight loved it soo much it was absolute mouth watering and yummy and donot forget to try their paya soup its tasty service a bit slow a bit cramped up seating
Went again and same the food was just mindblowing paya soup was too yummy and dum biryani was heaven must visit place"
1,"Do not ever order biryani from this place. I have ordered chicken biryani two times on different days and the first time the biryani was spolied so they send another one.The second time ordered yesterday there was no chicken but only rice in the biryani. They are fraud.

note - the order was placed through zomato and if we are ordering something then we expect the food to have good quality and proper quantity in the first time itself, otherwise you are wasting customers time and valuable money.

The chicken boneless biryani we ordered didn't have chicken at all, we didn't opened it the same day hence couldn't send it back. It was next day when we opened the packet we realised that there were no chicken at all. let alone the chicken, there were no potatoes or masala also.

The same instances repeating with multiple customers at different times itself says alot about your integrity."
1,"I have received only 1 or max 2 piece of chicken in chicken biryani like seriously, u don't expect 1 piece for a entire biryani of 500 rupees almost with rice , very disappointed"
1,COLD food... COCKROACHES... spiders and unhelpful staff. Never go there or you'll get sick and throw up
5,"We have visited this place many times and have ordered from swiggy countless times!
And it never ceases to amuse our tastebuds.
Matches Lucky Bandra quality!
Staff is friendly. Try out their amazing paya soup!"
5,"Delicious food with good place, Owner is also very welcoming. I never had food like this in Mumbai"
5,"If you‚Äôre from Kolkata or are seeking authentic Kolkatan ‚Äòamazing‚Äô food, this is it. Been ordering online from here since last 10 years, and it‚Äôs so fulfilling. The biryani is awesome, the pasanda is soft and yum - food comes well packed - Kolkata Konnection is such a go to option for me and my family!"
4,"The food is excellent with delicious kebabs and Aromatic Biryani.
The owner is very friendly and more than 16 years in Mumbai .. ur in for a BONG treat."
3,"The food is good and reasonably priced, more of pickup place than an actual dine-in."
5,"One of the best takeaway kolkata kaathi rolls.....much better than some of the big names. My absolute favourite is their chicken roll made crispy in less oil. This comes with and egg......making it actually an egg chicken roll.

I am yet to try their new kebabs......i am sure they are just as good"
1,"I had ordered veg pizza frm this restaurant usually its good but I don't wat happened  this time the way there waiter got this it was more like a cheese masala pav,called them n asked fr the replacement  which thy readily agreed but sorry to say it's over 30 min I have not got the replacement  of the same (normally thy deliver in 15/20 min as it's nearby)"

The restaurant has an normal non ac seating and an AC seating.

One of the best place for Sheesha lovers.
My go to place. You can head here anytime and this place won‚Äôt leave you disappointed. This place is even open late night or you can say early morning till 4-5:00 AM. What else you need?

5,"I was craving for pizza and thought of trying lazzetti, from Andheri, 4 bungalows.
I ordered :
Veg Mexicano Pizza

5,"Today we randomly visited this place which is located near oshiwara. They serve sandwiches , momos, shawarmas etc which is their speciality. We ordered chicken shawarma which was very yummy, its bread was very different then rest of the shawarmas we get. It was medium spicy in taste. Next we ordered tandoori chicken momos, they were also delicious, size was quite big and it was medium spicy in taste. Next we ordered chicken grill sandwich it had the mixture of chicken & veggies. Topped with mayonniese. The place is quite reasonbale. The only drawback is it does not have sittings but rest everything is really good quality, taste & quantity wise."

I seriously enjoyed the food & I will surely recommend this place to everyone üñ§"
3,You can get a good meal there. A little expensive
2,The coke floats was very bad only in that ice was there and ice was not there how the service is very bad and the cash counter was very rude i thing she is not give a better service to the customer
5,"Very good service.
A female staff named ‚ÄòShi‚Ä¶.‚Äô was very helpful today in order and helped us a lot.
Would recommend and she needs a raise"
5,It's really good place to enjoy your food with love and family members.every time I come I enjoy mc meals here
2,"The ambiance is beautiful and the place looks elegant. The order taking counter and delivery counter are on the ground floor and the seating area is above on the first floor which makes it a bit inconvenient.

The taste of the food is the same of every McDonald's. There's no compromise on the taste and quality of the food as expected.

But, this McDonald's was different from others because the service was very poor. The staff was short for taking the order and also in the kitchen. The whole process was really slow and the display didn't show any token number instead the customer needed to stand and ask for their food."
5,Wow.. Just Wow.. Superb resto bar.. Nice Ambiance. Best part is they are providing to play chess.ludu...etc for playing. Any body can enjoy.
3,A good place to booze with a pleasent atmosphere and at affordable price
5,Perfect place for cheap booze but a very local bar.
5,Guys Super resto bar at Veera Desai. We have njoyed the a lot.
2,Not a Pleasent place. Pungent smell. The palace must maintain hygeine to sustain
5,"Was feeling alot hungry so ended up ordering some food from this outlet located near adarsh nagar busstop. Its a pick up outlet for only ordering purpose but also has a small outdoor seating arrangement for 3 to 4 people. The service was faster. The hygiene level was satisfactory. We ordered for -
1. Paneer Chilli- This one was the yummiest out of the whole menu. The paneer was quiet soft and springy and was well marinated in the soy sauce and chillies.
2. Veg Seekh kebab- It was basically a potato seekh roll kebab. It was okayish in taste but had a very dry mouth feel.would taste good with sauce.
3.Subz Dum Biryani- It was same as the regular dum Biryanis and was served with complimentary raita and green chutney which added more flavour when had together with the Biryani.The veggies in the biryani were well cooked.
4. Triple schezwan fried Rice - Chinese has always been my favorite cuisine hence something from the menu had to be Chinese so ordered this. The rice along with the gravy tasted yumm!
Personally I had a good experience. The service,food, packaging everything was good . The only thing they need to have more consideration on is their outlet and the kitchens hygiene. Would still recommend this outlet for a one time visit for sure!"
5,"The night chulhaa an emerging food providing outlet situated in Andheri Adarsh nagar, I ordered some items recently from the night chulhaa and enjoyed their awesome taste and perfect blending of ingredients.

This place is clean & hygienic and well maintained with only 1 table for eating and is mainly focused in delivering their items rather than dine in. We ordered the following items...
Chicken cheesy garlic kebab
Bunna chicken naan slider
Tawa murgh
Chicken Singapore rice."
4,"As a foodie I like to explore new places which serves good food and I recently found out The Night Chulhaa. As I was working for the whole day and it was too late to visit any place I saw this place which serves food even at 4 o clock in the morning which is actually amazing...
So I visited the place. The place is decent and have a decent sitting arrangement.
But the best thing is you can satisfy your craving in even in early morning or midnight.
Now coming onto the food here is what we tried..
Chicken cheese garlic Kabab.
Chicken seekh kabab.
Veg burnt garlic rice.
Paneer crispy.
Gulab jamun.

If you are a person like me you who is a big foodie and is not so concerned with the ambience then this place might be for you"
5,"A really nice place to order food from if you happen to be a big fan of desi chinese. Although this takeout joint serves both Mughlai and Chinese food, we prefer the chinese here for its has great taste and amazing portion size.

While we have called a lot of times from this joint, the dishes we would highly like to recommend the next time you order your take out, it is Paneer Singapuri for starters, Paneer In Manchurian Sauce as mains in gravy, Veg Triple Schezwan Fried Rice because no desi chinese meal is complete without it and Veg Hongkong Noodles.

What also works for this take out joint is that it delivers till wee hours in the morning so you definitely don't have to worry about late night cravings or call in for food when you have friends over for a night party."
4,"Liked this quirky name, it's really apt because it is a delivery outlet that opens at 7.30 pm and delivers till 5 am. So convenient for those who eat late or have hunger pangs right in the middle of the night.
So I ordered:
#APPETIZERS#
1. Paneer chilly cheese- liked this one but the chicken version of this won my heart
2.Chicken chilly cheese- my favourite dish from the meal

#MAINS#
1.Butter chicken
2.Paneer tikka masala
3. Butter tandoori roti
The mains were good too."
3,"BusaGo is a nice small place located in Oshiwara. We tried their 3 flavoured prawns, the prawns were soft and tasty but the gravy and rice weren't quite appealing to our taste buds.It was priced at 355. Next we tried their basil chicken which was okay which was priced at 345. The staff was quite friendly but the food didn't work it's magic for us."
5,"A definite recommendation.
It's a small place with a fairly limited menu, but the food is brilliant.
We had Burmese chicken Kaukswe, veg as well as chicken Tibetan momos.
One can tell by the unique flavours that each item is carefully crafted.
The peach and lemon ice tea are amazing as well."
4,"Rainy Days and Asian Food go hand in hand. It was raining heavily and I didn't want to be at home. I wanted to go out for a meal.

Decided on Busago while browsing through Zomato. They have the best Kaukswe (Khow Suey)  and I had a craving for that.

The closest Busago to me is Oshiwara so visited here for dinner.

They also have Zomato Gold on food which is a plus point for me.

A pretty big outlet, around 10 tables inside and 2 tables outside. The ambiance is the classic Busago Style with bowls on the wall, menu on their walls and a wall dedicated completely to Kaukswe.

I started with some Coconut Nimbu Pani as both are my favorite flavors. The combination seemed a little odd, but then taste wise it was good and refreshing.

APPETIZERS

Crispy Potatoes :

Batter fried, crispy potatoes, tossed in chopped garlic, chillies and coriander and herbs. I asked it to be extra spicy. I am in love with this dish. The smoky flavor of tossing the potatoes in the spices, the crispiness, the hotness, everything was just absolutely amazingly perfect.

** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED **

Tibetan Chicken Momos :

6 pieces of Chicken Momos served in the steamer. Chicken cooked perfectly, though less spicy. I had it with the Chibs Chilli sauce and it tasted yumm.

MAIN COURSE

Vegetarian Kaukswe :

Kaukswe or Khow Suey is one of my favorite Burmese dish. It's a one pot meal which contains either rice or noodles, yellow burmese curry with veggies or chicken. Khow Suey also has condiments on the side like peanuts, fried onion, fried garlic, celery, coriander leaves, spring onion greens, chilli flakes and lemon. You take noodles in a bowl, add the curry and add the condiments of your choice in them. I absolutely loved it. Their veggies were very crispy, not soggy and the curry was beautifully flavored.

Busago and Khow Suey go hand in hand.

** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED **

Red Thai Curry with Sticky Rice :

Red Thai Curry is something I had never tried. I always opt for Green Thai Curry. But this time I thought will try red as its supposed to be a little spicier than Green. I ordered it with sticky rice as sticky rice is my favorite. The color was a beautiful brick red. There was a big basil leaf floating on top. It had veggies like zucchini, flower, broccoli and peas. But It was not spicy, just a mild version of spicy. But it tasted good. Specially with the rice.

DESSERT

Chocolate Mousse :

I absolutely loved the chocolate mousse here. This is the first time I have hogged up a chocolate mousse. A hint of salt in the sweetness of the chocolate was made this chocolate mousse gourmet style.

** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED **

The staff is well versed with the dishes and serve well. There were many online orders going out throughout my visit but it didn't hinder with my order.

Keep it up...!!!"
5,"I had heard a lot about this place so finally got a chance to pay a visit here.

*DESSERT*
Chocolate mousse- was really soft and tempting

This place or rather brand is quite renowned and vintage. Hats off to chef Nikhil Chib, good work done."
5,"The portion sizes were good and the food was delicious. We ordered Gado Gado Salad(Very tasty), Sesame Teriyaki Chicken Noodles (Tasty), 3 Flavoured Prawns with Noodles (Good), Spicy Chilly Veg Noodles (Tasty), Lemon Tart (Good), Banofee Tart(Good), Chocolate Mousse (Okay), Chocolate Cake (Okay)."
1,This is such a pathetic place where you wont like to visit again the bar  owner and the person standing at the couner is soo disrespectful they even charge for the fried noodles and shezuan also if you order Any Chinese dish also & when asked they respond like its charged every where‚Ä¶there should be some courtesy for the guest he was responding in such a rude manner
5,"The liquor quality is good, and management has maintained the quality from day one to date. Also, it is very close to Jogeshwari station, so one can easily find it."
3,"Place is average, not bad, they have cheapest rate for food and price per peg.
Ambience is not so well. Only good if looking for cheap dine-in."
5,Ambions was excellent and food was nice when it was very hot and juicy and coming to service we have experience an five star hotel service in this restaurant and atmosphere was pretty good.
5,Fantastic place people and very much carrying I got door step delivered per promised and I can say they deserve more then 5*  really u people are  best üëç will always save the number if I come back to mumbai I will only call u people for delivery
4,"A very popular quarter bar, this place provides liquor at economical rates. Always crowded and the place also serves good food. We went for the top three Mumbai chakhna items - masala papad, boiled chana and the golden anchovy (mandeli) fry.
There is not much to write about the decor - a bit congested with closely packed furniture and a layer of cigarette smoke. Service is efficient. All in all - the place provides a slice of the Mumbai quarter bar culture. We enjoyed the night."
1,"They charged unnecessarily for the first floor stating that there is something extra in the first floor, however neither there is any good food, nor there anything special, just loud music upstairs. Girls do dance there however the girls are of the age of 50+ years... So no excitement... U can enjoy daadis dancing on loud music"
5,"Highly recommended the booze is cheap, service is top notch and the food is amazing, good quantity, yet affordable. (We only had Veg options)
We Spent 2.5hrs there just boozing having food and chilling.

Service was really good the waiter was really kind to us and was at our service all the time.
Service I didn't expect from an okeish looking bar. The waiter cleaned our tables 3 to 4 times even for the glass water on the table. Was brought cigarettes when we asked for. The waiter switched off the fan when he spotted us lighting cigarettes and then put it back on. I didn't expect.

The food was amazing will highly recommend the Veg Dum Biryani.

The place was relatively full when we go there at 2pm on a Saturday (non-AC)."
4,Inexpensive and Great hospitable service.. a good place to visit for a quick drink and a good bite
4,Good bar & restaurant. AC working fine. You will get chilled beer and tasty snacks.

4,"Kailash Parbat is a delightful gem for anyone craving authentic Indian cuisine, especially with a rich North Indian and Sindhi flavor. Located in a convenient spot, this restaurant beautifully blends traditional flavors with a touch of modernity. The ambiance is cozy yet vibrant, making it ideal for families, friends, or even solo diners. The decor has a classic, Indian touch, creating an inviting atmosphere that complements the culinary journey.

One of the highlights of Kailash Parbat is its extensive and diverse menu. Known for their chaats, the Pani Puri and Dahi Puri are absolute must-tries, bringing authentic street food flavors right to your table with hygiene assured. Their Pav Bhaji and Chole Bhature are also incredibly popular, and for good reason‚Äîboth dishes are rich in flavor and generously portioned. Another standout is the Ragda Pattice, a lesser-known dish that is packed with a unique blend of spices and textures.

Kailash Parbat also caters to a wide range of dietary preferences, including plenty of vegetarian options, which makes it a fantastic choice for those with specific dietary needs. The service is commendable, with friendly staff who are attentive yet give diners space to enjoy their meals. Prices are quite reasonable given the quality and authenticity of the food. For anyone looking to experience the best of Indian flavors in a comfortable setting, Kailash Parbat is a great choice that promises a satisfying and memorable dining experience.!!!!"
1,"Went there considering the brand name , although the ambiance was good
The waiter was so rude and the food served was cold.
Had put my phone on charge while I started eating, as the battery was very low.
Once I was done eating i thought just to wait for a few more mins so that once the battery reaches a certain percentage I'll leave. In the mean time the waiter was constantly moving around my table as if he was waiting for me to leave asap
& THE WHOLE RESTAURANT WAS EMPTY ONLY 3 TABLES WERE OCCUPIED INCLUDING MINE."
4,"Restaurant serving Indian street food called chaat, indo chinese, north, South Indian food, sandwiches/wraps and so much more!"
2,"A friend had suggested this place for lunch to us, we aren‚Äôt from Mumbai so we thought we will try it out. Food was good, the service was pretty slow even though there were only 3 tables booked the whole time we were there. Another thing I‚Äôd like to point out to the manager / owner of the place. We had 2 waiters serve us, the young one was fine and did his job fine, then an older one started serving us right at the end and he is also the one that bought the bill out which was a total of 1,250. I asked him to also bring the card machine over, he bought the card machine and said ‚Äúmaam the bill doesn‚Äôt include any service tax so would you like to give 50 as the tip?‚Äù I said ‚Äúokay‚Äù and then he typed in a total of ‚Äú1,500‚Äù and I looked at that before inserting my card and asked him ‚Äú250 in just tip?‚Äù He looked at me and just nodded. So I confusingly agreed..
I don‚Äôt agree with this amount and that he just typed it in himself on the machine rather than handing me the machine. I‚Äôve been in Mumbai now for about 10 days and every restaurant I have been to has included service tax on the invoice and if I truly liked the service I always would leave a tip where necessary. But in also saying that, I‚Äôve never heard of a 20% tip.. please let the manager or owner of the place read this as it leaves a sour taste in anyone‚Äôs mouth especially if they are foreigners to feel a bit cheated like this.. it‚Äôs not about the money, it‚Äôs just morally not correct. Just because someone doesn‚Äôt speak your language or understand the taxes in the country, doesn‚Äôt mean you can take advantage of that. And then my friends asked me the next day at a party about how I liked her lunch suggested place and I had to tell everyone this unfortunate event, so this also creates a bad name for the honesty of the restaurant through word of mouth. Thank you for the food but hopefully this can improve on the wait staff end."
2,"I recently tried the Chicken Manchurian and Egg Fried Rice Bowl from Cafe Shimla, Oshiwara, and unfortunately, the experience was quite underwhelming.

Food Quality & Taste:
The Chicken Manchurian gravy lacked flavor, making it hard to even recognize as a proper Manchurian dish. The seasoning was weak, and the overall taste felt bland and unbalanced. The Egg Fried Rice Bowl was also disappointing, missing the expected wok-fried aroma and depth of flavor.

Portion Size:
One of the few positives was the portion size, which was quite generous. However, quantity alone doesn't compensate for the lack of taste.

Packaging:
The food was well-packaged, ensuring no spills or mess, which was a plus.

Overall Experience:
Despite the decent portion size and good packaging, the flavor and quality need significant improvement. It didn‚Äôt feel like I was eating authentic Chicken Manchurian, which was disappointing. If they enhance the seasoning and overall preparation, this could be a much better meal.

Would I order again? Not unless they improve the quality."
4,"It always surprises me how this place ever stays empty. The food is dirt-cheap, the owners ever-smiling, and for an old-school Mughlai place, the hygiene is top-notch. And, hands down the best, smoothest, chillest caramel custard in town - I often go here JUST for the custard."
2,"Ordered Daal Khichdi Only Rs. 190
Found a red thread.
The taste was OK.
But for Daal Khichdi Rs. 190 too much"
5,"I can see lots of bad experience below. but I am visiting Cafe Simla for less than a year now but I believe this is an amazing non veg restaurant. below are my anytime non thinkable suggestions :

non veg tasty
dal gosht & steam rice
any chicken gravy

vegetarians tasty (my friend is vege)
veg biryani
any veg sabzi (tell them less oil n they'll do it)

tea (normal or kadak)
caramel custard

there may be more but you'll never regret this.

enjoy!"
1,Today i order a paneer masala an Biryani.very bad experience an bad test and oil quality is very bad.i waste my money 810/-Dont place order this hotel .
5,"Went here without any plans over a weekend and it was such a pleasant experience. Staff is definitely great, warm and helpful. It‚Äôs a pretty large place l, usually not seen in mumbai. Food is good, drinks menu is quite elaborate.
Music over weekend is super, the place turns out to be a super dancing place in night. Crowd quality is good so it‚Äôs a great experience."
5,"You walk into Glocal Junction nd it's like stepping into a culinary carnival. The place is buzzing, the music is pumping, and the food? Well, it's a rollercoaster of flavors that'll leave your taste buds doing the cha-cha-cha.
The Good:
* Food Fiesta: From Italian pasta that's so good, you'll swear you're in Rome, to Indian curries that'll make your grandma jealous, the menu is a global gourmet adventure.
* Ambiance: The place is a vibe. The decor is a mishmash of styles, but somehow it all works. It's like a trendy flea market meets a chic nightclub.
* People Watching: Forget the food; the real show is the crowd. You'll see everything from couples on a date night to groups of friends celebrating a birthday. It's like a real-life reality TV show.
The Bad:
* Service Hiccups: The staff is as friendly as a puppy, but sometimes they're a bit too busy chasing their tails to keep up. Be prepared for some long waits.
* Pricey Pleasure: Let's be honest, dining here isn't cheap. But hey, you're paying for the experience, right?
Overall:
Glocal Junction is a rollercoaster of emotions. One minute you're loving the food, the next you're waiting for your drink. But hey, that's part of the fun! If you're looking for a place to see and be seen, and you don't mind paying a premium for the experience, then Glocal Junction is the place for you. Just be prepared for a wild ride!"
5,"This establishment consistently exceeds my expectations. The ambiance and atmosphere are delightful, the food is both delicious and impressive, and the manager and staff are friendly, courteous, and efficient. The service is quick and fantastic, and the music and DJ are lively and energetic. In terms of food, I highly recommend their wide range of appetizers, pizzas, and biryanis. The prices are reasonable when considering the overall experience and the quality of the food. They offer both outdoor and indoor seating, and valet parking is available."
4,"An amazing place for a weekend lunch buffet! They have a load of variety with a good DJ and live screening. The starters were too good! I believe that the main course menu can be revisited! The Arabiata and Alfredo pastas, both were equally tasty!! ü§§"
3,"Place is ok but DJ disappointed a lot. Food was good and offers are also quite well.
At such places DJ plays most important role. Only having loud music doesn't make any sense if the song selection is appropriate. Scope for improvement as long as music is concerned."
5,"Great food they serve, I visited this place thrice in 2 weeks for the taste. They serve panipuri shot at start and paan shot at end , it‚Äôs the best part. I tried butter chicken, chicken achari, Chura papad, bhala papadi and they were so delicious. One thing that I didn‚Äôt like was the dal makhani I mean the taste was good but other items had set a level that dal makhani couldn‚Äôt reach. One must try item is the dal khichadi ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞

They serve alcohol and have a clean washroom"
2,"We went there for lunch, the service was very slow.... Except for the Jalebi rabdi rest everything was average. not worth the price..... The asthetic is good, would recommend only for one time visit."
4,"We were served some mint drinks in the beginning which was ok. Food was ok too. Had ordered Rogan Josh and masala prawns, but too much masala in the prawns that you would hardly see any prawns. Too many mosquitoes too. Don't wear shorts otherwise you will be eaten by mosquitoes. Their own drink was good. Quite tasty."
5,"Loved the authentic Punjabi North Indian food. They serve onion and garlic with chaat masala with food which adds up to the taste. Dhaba vibes in middle of Mumbai. They have valet so no parking hassles.
They give complimentary Pan Shots at the end. Jalebi are just try."
4,"Pratap‚Äôs the Dhaba is a place which we used to frequent many years ago..and we always had good food there. It is the quintessential PUNJABI dhaba atmosphere which they have tried to recreate at this restaurant. So there is nothing modern or a Minimalistic Zen architecture,  but a rustic Punjabi feel. The music is naturally Punjabi and the minute you enter you feel like breaking into a  bhangra..Ok let‚Äôs not get carried away - we were in mood to have some real Punjabi food and were not disappointed.
‚úÖ Vodka pani puri shots was our first dish. They give you a peg of vodka which you need to mix with the pani ( of pani puri). And make your pani puri with it. My wife wanted to taste it and it was decent. This is their concoction and it is their signature dish.
‚úÖ Keema paratha ( mutton keema cooked with masala stuffed in a paratha) - good 4/5
‚úÖ Chicken tikka masala - this was pretty good. The masala and flavors came together nicely in this dish. 4.5/5. You need to know that this dish is rarely good in taste when you visit other restaurants.
‚úÖ They give you Paan shots as a digestive which is quite tasty. 4/5
‚úÖ Before they serve any food they give you ROASTED GARLIC with some real finemasala sprinkled on top. ( see picture). When garlic is roasted or cooked properly it has a sweet taste - as compared to a pungent flavor which it usually has. 4/5
A unique place with some unique dishes.
Had fun with good food. Recommended."
4,What a greate combination of veg manchurian and veg fried rice. Dry manchurian rich in garlic was giving spicy flavour. Best option for vegitarian chinese lover.üôÇ
5,"Sizzling spices is famous for its Chinese , Asian , Indonesian and much more such cuisines.
We visited here recently and had a wonderful dining experience.
We tried the Naga chilly wings
Then Thai chilly basil dry
It was really delicious.
Then in main course chicken chilly burnt garlic rice .
It was really good and great quantity too.
Service was quick too.
Overall it was a very nice experience."

... so good ....fresh veggies and honey oat bread awesome tasty."
1,"Worst subway outlet. Subway is known for fresh breads, I ordered twice from this outlet and received stale bread, which was hard to bite and also not once but twice, and also the sauces I asked for they didn‚Äôt put and the quantity of sauce was so small that it seemed like a dry subway."
3,"Subway sandwiches are an healthy alternative to a lot of junk food options, however, their pricing does not justify the quantity....Though, they still remain one of my fav sandwich joint, due to lack of better options.."
5,"A small cute nice place. Very well lit with good utilization of space. When I entered, the person at the counter greeted me with a smile & asked me what I wanted to eat. As I was a little confused as to what shall I order, he helped me with the vegetarian options & also suggested to go for sub of the day as that would have benifitted me monetarily. Finally, after 2 minutes of thinking, I placed my order. He was very quick at making the sandwich upto my satisfaction !
Food -5/5
Health quotient - 5/5
Hygiene - 4/5
Ambience - 3.5/5
Music - 3/5
Value for money - 5/5

Next time you want to eat a nice healthy meal... stop here... very quick & efficient."
4,Good experience.sandwich was nice but less of cheese in it. As always lots and lots of fresh veggies.seating space is comfortable
5,Visited the oshiwara yokos after a decade & I must say that the quality & quantity of the sizzlers is as good as before. We ordered Steak sizzler & Veg exotica sizzler. The Steak sizzler was amongst the best we have ever had & the veg exotica sizzler was loaded with vegetables. Loved the food & the service. Am so glad you ca. still count of yokos for being one of the best places to eat.
3,"Went to Yoko Sizzlers on Sunday afternoon and there was waiting at 1:30pm. We had ordered Veg. Exotica Sizzler and Peri Peri Paneer Sizzler, they were more than enough for 3 people and were loaded but the main reason for  giving 3* is they both tasted almost same which was not expected. For dessert we ordered Sizzling Brownie, we felt it didn't justify the price they charged. Ambience is ok, nothing to say much. The overall experience was just OK."
5,"I ordered Yoko's Special Chicken Sizzlers and I must say, it was the best sizzler I have ever tasted till now.
Even if Manager said that salt will be less and chicken will be bland but when I tried the food, I felt that food was great. Their chicken was juicy, nicely seasoned, and very tasty. Also the sauce was just wow, all the spices which was making it more tasty.
Also I ordered Kiwi Mocktail, and it was very tasty. It is made with real kiwis and you can taste that real kiwi and mint flavour in it. It is very refreshing.
Talking about hospitality, Manager and waiters were so humble, knows their stuff and so kind.
So in conclusion I can say that it is the best place for sizzler and I will definitely visit again to try other sizzler dishes."
4,"One of the longest running places in Oshiwara that offers good quality Sizzlers. Have visited this place twice and there was gap of a few years between the two visits but the quality of food and quantity of food remained same as far as my experience is concerned. Yoko Sizzlers is a great place to visit if one wants to explore and try out Sizzlers. The place also offers other dishes apart from Sizzlers but this dish is their specialty. Entering the restaurant one gets greeted with smoke all over due to the Sizzlers being served on almost all the tables. The taste, quality and quantity were great and also tried their fried rice which was good as well. Overall a good place to visit if you wish to enjoy Sizzlers and they also give you a word search puzzle which helps you pass time while you wait for your order to be delivered on your table."
5,"We had an amazing experience at Yoko's sizzler and a big part of that was thanks to our server - Mr. Jagdish. He was attentive, friendly, and made sure everything was perfect from start to finish. Whether it was recommending the best sizzler on the menu or checking in at just the right moments, his service was truly top-notch. It's rare to find someone who genuinely enjoys what they do, and it showed in every interaction. Great food paired with great service by Mr. JAGDISH what more can you ask for?"
1,Very bad service from staff. Giving French fries instead of chicken wings. When asked they‚Äôre argued. If we paid for chicken wings why we accept French fries?
1,"We ordered dine in mistakenly on the application but reached the Andheri West Infinity mall outlet, and we took the order for delivery and then we opened the whopper box at the office and it was eaten and at the counter we saw Ashish check the box twice and yet packed the eaten burger. Hence will be visiting the outlet for full order replacement as it's very inappropriate for the outlet to diliver us the eaten burger.

Regards"
4,"This Burger King outlet is in the food court with other restaurants, what I liked about this outlet was that the staff was courteous and very fast.
We ordered the Veg Whopper which was very tasty and the bun was very soft, along with a good quality of patty in between. I would recommend veg whopper any day over other veg burgers by fast food chains.
We also tried the Pizza Puff which is a very close copy to the Mcpuff by Mcdonalds. They have an introductory offer of 2 for Rs 59 so you can definitely try that as well."
5,Chicken Nuggets were amazing and also tried their chicken burger which was amazing chicken nuggets as well as chicken pathy is well cooked . Great taste and must try Burger King
3,Good outlet to sit inside the food court. I had a veg whopper with peri peri fries and it was okay.
3,"Good ambience. Good pure veg restaurant. Tried cheese garlic bread which was really good. Avocado toast was very amazing. These two are must try. Mexican fondue was okay, would not recommend. A really good place with a wide variety of options from pizza, pasta to Mexican. Good desert options too."
4,"Nice place that I was invited to for dinner. I prefer non veg food but their veg food is awesome.
Jalepeno poppers could have more jalepeno but I didn't mind the cheese.
The lotus was incredible.
Korean cheese buns and the cheese fondue were also spectacular.
Stir fry mushrooms were okay nothing to rave about. But the nachos were lovely. The avocado toast wasn't bad either, but I didn't like the pumpkin seeds and pomegranate on it.
The Sicilian pizza and the sizzler were also decent, not too good not too bad.
Go for it."
5,"We recently visited Quesso for an office Diwali lunch, and it turned out to be a wonderful experience! This fine dining restaurant offers a lovely ambience that enhances the festive atmosphere. With a variety of food options available, our group was eager to explore the menu.

We started with the Nachos El Classico, which were absolutely delicious, featuring the perfect amount of veggies and cheese. The Cheese Chilli Garlic Bread was another hit‚Äîrich and cheesy, it was delightful for sharing.

The Sizzler we ordered was packed with flavor and beautifully presented, making it a standout dish. We also tried the Korean Cheese Pull Bun, which was yummy, with fantastic herb flavors that elevated the dish.

For drinks, we chose the Virgin Pi√±a Colada, which was refreshing, and the Spiced Maiden, a unique concoction with guava and a tangy spice that was simply amazing.

To finish off our meal, we indulged in the Lotus Biscoff Ice Cream, which was super delicious and a perfect sweet ending to our lunch.

The staff at Quesso was very helpful and polite, providing excellent hospitality throughout our visit.

Overall, Quesso is a great choice for anyone looking for a fine dining experience. The combination of a fantastic ambience, delectable food, and attentive service makes it a must-visit for your next outing!"
1,"Think before visiting this building if visiting visit at your own risk as the building is in a very bad condition.
Yesterday 29/4/25 at around 10pm a *Horrific Incident* took place at Link Plaza lift.
The restaurant staff was also least bothered to what has happened.
We had gone to Quesso Restaurant above Shree Jee on the 2nd floor after our dinner we called the lift and I entered the lift with my 6 year old son along came my daughter then as my wife entered the lift just as she stepped in the lift slowly started moving down my daughter saw the lift doors closing and lift shifting down my daughter screamed and pulled my wife inside.
We even didn‚Äôt press any button and the lift moved down luckily till it reached the 1st floor the lift moved slowly then it went straight on the ground with a bang I tried pressing the button and alarms button nothing was working.
Luckily we all are fine but that trauma hit my 15 yr old daughter very hard both my children are shaken with this incident. I started banging the doors then I forced open the inside door later the Ice Cream Works office next door heard the banging they came for our rescue and got the security to open the door from out as the outer door was locked and I couldn‚Äôt open from inside.
And the management of Link Plaza were very cool no precautionary steps were taken I kept on telling them to shut down the mains of the lift or atleast barricade the door but they are like we locked the door it will not open.
When asked them where is the society management they said we don‚Äôt know
So I called up the Senior Inspector at Oshiwara Police Station he was there in fraction of time and when he told him they shut down the lift and put a barricade in front of the door they did so.
The condition of Link Plaza is so terrible. Looks like an incident is waiting to happen.
Today we were saved by the almighty but it could happen with anyone else.
I request all residents to be alert while entering into this building."
5,"Firstly to locate this place Is not easy if you are visiting this place for the first time. Secondly, just because it's located in not so good locality don't miss out this restaurant.
They serve everything delicious.
The service is bang on and in time service
But don't take your personal dessert ad they don't entertain the same.
They serve some tasty desserts hence don't encourage outside desserts.
The food is not very economical but definitely worth the amount
Best part is they do take reservations.
So yes one of my favorite restaurants in the locality üòãIf the review helps you do put a thumbs upüòä"
5,"The restaurant offers a pleasant ambiance and delicious food. The staff is courteous and humble, there's plenty of two-wheeler parking available, and the live orchestra adds a nice touch to the experience."
2,We visited on Sunday night. There is an open section and also an ac one. Veg Manchurian soup was good. Roasted chicken chilly was okay. Chicken afgani tasted average. Service was very very slow. Not recommended
4,"Visited this restaurant on Friday. Initially I found no one but slowly slowly it got crowded. I tried many foods such as nonveg platters, crispy chicken, bombil fry, prawns, chicken fried rice and burnt garlic rice.

The best part was the live music with 4 singers. For those who require silence,they have a separate lounge. Food quality was good. I hope to visit soon someday."
4,Open space bar with big space and good for family also at dombivli east padhurkar collage. Not so costly open at 11 am.

No more the same place as earlier.
They serve food in HUGE quantity but surely they had lost its quality."

1,"Cat Pee Disaster at Nandi Palace: Don't Go Here!
Seriously, Nandi Palace in Dombivli is just gross. The people there were also really unpleasant. It's a super dirty place and the food tasted awful ‚Äì they should just close it down. Its mini UP and Bihar ambience. While we were trying to eat their disgusting food, people at another table started complaining about water dripping from the roof (which is just a tent, not a real roof). Guess what? It wasn't water. It was cat pee! Pee was falling all over their food and on them. You could see pee marks all over the tent roof, and the manager didn't really care or help. The food was really disappointing, and the singers were just boring ‚Äì some old guy singing old songs badly. The whole place felt depressing. Just don't go to this hotel. It's bad."
3,"Once among the best places to have dinner the place has not scaled up on service levels n seems outdated. Went after 15 yrs but the service has dipped and cleanliness too.

I recently had the pleasure of staying at Nandi Palace Hotel, and it was an outstanding experience from start to finish! The hospitality was top-notch, with friendly and attentive staff who went above and beyond to make my stay comfortable.

The rooms were spacious, spotless, and well-equipped with all the amenities needed for a relaxing stay. The bed was incredibly comfortable, ensuring a great night‚Äôs sleep. The hotel‚Äôs ambiance was elegant yet cozy, making it perfect for both business and leisure travelers.

The food at the restaurant was absolutely delicious, offering a variety of local and international dishes. Every meal was a delight! The hotel‚Äôs location is also convenient, making it easy to explore nearby attractions.

Overall, Nandi Palace Hotel exceeded my expectations, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a luxurious and welcoming stay. I‚Äôll definitely be returning!

1,"I recently purchased Kesar Kaju Katli from Ashok sweets dombivli west, expecting the same soft and fresh quality as the trial piece provided. However, upon opening the packed box, I was extremely disappointed to find that the sweets were hard, stale, and far from fresh.

It is evident that the vendor misled customers by offering a fresh sample but packing an old and inferior batch. This is not only unethical but also unacceptable, especially when dealing with perishable food items. The texture was completely off, making the sweets difficult to eat, and the kesar flavor felt faded, indicating that the batch was not fresh.

Such practices damage customer trust, and I regret my purchase. I strongly urge the vendor to maintain consistency and honesty in their products. I will not be purchasing from them again."
1,We bought Kaju katli to take this to abroad for my brother. When he opened sweet box in office and distributed to colleagues. They saw Fly (makkhi) in 2-3 kaju katli. It was so embarrassing. I need my full refund. Else need to complaint FSSAI to give surprise visit in their kitchen once.
1,Cheaters‚Ä¶ This shop is just opposite railway station (West) i have taken ‚Çπ90 tocken for 2 samosas and 3 vada pav. Guy on counter just packed 3 pav and 2 samosas. We have opened parcel in the train and disappointed. Special my daughter who was asking vada pav badly üòû
1,We wanted to purchase 100gm Pedhas for gifting purpose. The person at the counter packed it in a small transparent plastic bag. We asked for a box and explained that we need to gift it. I mean would anyone like being gifted sweets in a loose plastic bag? We even offered to pay extra money for the box. Despite this the person at the counter simply refused the box and asked us to buy 200gm for a box. We just walked out of the store in disgust. Totally annoyed by this rude and unprofessional behaviour. They need to understand preventing wastage of food is more important than indirectly coercing people to buy extra (unwanted) food.
1,"Yesterday I purchased 250g Maisur pak .......but when i opened the pack , It was little hard and tastes also bad......today i return the same packet in shop .....but they were not ready to agree the sweet is not fresh......very bad experience and very arrogant staff"
1,"Hi All ,
I had worst experience in Dombivili East Ramnagar Monginis shop. I had ordered 1 kg Black forest cake for my Daughter's Birthday 2 days before. I collected the cake at Birthday evening but didnt checked the box bcoz of my trust on Moginis Brand. After cake cutting ceremony and cutting whole cake for guest saw that cake has strawberry flavour.
The white layer was not white but pink.

First time in life saw Starwberry Black forest cake. ......
It was too late so i kept cake in bowl to return them back. I clicked the snap and shared with the shop manager at night. Morning when I went to branch they accepted their mistake but said refund is possible only if i have that Carboard on which cake is kept as it has barcode. They have my payment reciept Gpay transfer details but thats useless all they need is the card board. Later they took some pieces of cake for sending it to factory. I didnt got my refund

My request to all
1. Please check your orders at the shop only before collecting for the flavour
2. After cake cutting first taste the cake and then give it to guest to avoid embarassment. I had faced that almost everyone returned the cake back
3. Most importang dont throw the cardboard on which cake is kept
4. Also check expiry date of chips packet before buying it. One day when I went for buying it all chips packs where expiring after 2 days"
4,Chocolate cakes are the good. They have different options in black forest and fruit/cream cakes.
1,"I just purchased 4 pastries from that moginis shop
Very bad experience  pastries are not fresh. Taste also not good     waste of money
Pastries also high rate as per market"
1,"Pathetic cake shop... The owner does not know how to speak with female customers.. Also the prices of all Monginis cakes are over priced... If Monginis bakers company are reading this... Kindly look into the matter as they over charge the price of the cake... The license of selling cakes for this shop should be taken back... They are putting down the name of Monginis....a chocolate cake worth 300 is charged for 350 and the cake worth 350 is charged for 400... They are big time cheaters, cheating the customers... People should avoid visiting this shop... They are big time fraudsters.... Thank you....."
5,"Taste is great. Even if we have so many Cake shops in our area, we order cake only from Monginis. Verity of Cakes in different shapes. Prices are obviously high as they provide quality in product. Also available other breakfast stuff. Delivery is always on time."
5,Good service. Ambient place. Fresh pizzas.
3,Small.outlet but had all the offers running. Mostly occupied by locals. Polite staff and hygiene maintained.
1,Worst outlet ever. Good for nothing people work here and make our meal time worst. They just give excuses for us to cancel our order and keep giving excuses of why they got delayed. Either change the employees or just shut the outlet down. God knows what are the ingredients and how fresh is the food and vegetables they use if they are this lazy.
4,Nice place to have pizza in dombivli easily accessable. Good taste. It took 10 minutes to serve pizza to us. When is was not so crowded. So expect more time in weekends and holidays. Toppings where good as expected. seating is less so you will have to wait. Overall good experience.
1,We came up and to sit and eat but there was no staff to guide us. There were no chairs available for atleast 10 mins. we only then pulled out the chairs and sat. After that it took very long time to serve the order. The washroom is also dirty.
5,Amazing food.. they have limited food options like either you can select a veg/non veg meal or order Parotha with chicken/fish/veg bhaji.. but the food served is so tasty and mouth watering.. chettinad chicken and pepper chicken is best..
5,Delicious food prompt service best atmosphere and polite staff plus prompt service. Mind blowing.
5,"The cakes are very creative. Innovative and looks amazing on first glimpse only. The owner Smita proves her creativity and passion for cake making. Her cakes shows the passion of work done. Though home-made product, gives a royal touch to the product. üëåüëåüëåWords are scarce to explain."
5,It was nice to visit this place I was really very impressed with the service and the treatment which I had received from the staff and food was awesome....I would like to visit again and again....specialy thanks to owner Mr. Hemant Shetty and ho co worker Mr. Ashok Shetty
5,Nice food for buffet quality is also good nice open place to site with group and family staff is also freindly
4,Free home delivery... V tasty sandwich... Jain options also available.. Cleaniness is good...ambience is lively...must visit
5,"Pahadi Sandwich is the ""Best"" Must Try."
5,Very Nice Food Home Delivery Available
5,Nice ambiance with nice fast food
5,Pahadi sandwich is must try!!
5,"If you love Malvani food or are a non-veg lover, this place is a must-visit in Dombivli! If you‚Äôre in the area, do yourself a favor and visit‚Äîyou‚Äôll thank me later. Amazing!

Order anything here, and I promise you‚Äôll be happy with the food. The atmosphere is completely desi‚Äîit feels like you‚Äôre sitting right near a kitchen. No AC, no fancy setup, just pure, authentic flavors. But the food? La jawab! Absolutely worth it!"
4,"Good food, nice place to taste proper fish dishes"
5,"excellent place to eat Maharashtrian style sea food. inexpensive, tasty and a cozy welcoming place."
2,Average food...poor service....very Bad atmosphere.... Wash basin is so dirty... Broken tap .no handwash...no glass only pet bottle for all....Rice bhakri is so bad n not properly cooked.....very average taste..it's my personal experience.
5,A great place in Dombivli to find real Malvani food. The solkadhi can be better and the quantity of the prawns fry is too little. But the taste is great and the fishes are fresh across all choices.
4,"Good fine dine restaurant, clean and pretty interior with good air-conditioning, food wise also decent taste, French fries we got were dripping of oil and the plate was full of oily,
chicken tikka  biryani, chicken triple noodles, chicken lolipop was also good."
4,"A good Family Restaurant and Bar in Dombivli.  You have a lot of sea food and non veg options. We tried mutton shorba and mushroom soup. Mutton shorba was good. Mushroom was disappointing as both had same base. Chicken pieces in chilly milli kabab were juicy. Mutton dum Biryani was perfect. We didn't like Solkadi , felt like it was extra spicy. Over-all good taste except Solkadi and mushroom soup."
4,"This was my first time visiting Sunny Family Bar & Restaurant. The staff and management are very hospitable. We visited here for dinner on a Sunday and just after shravan had ended so i believe that was one of the reasons that we got a table only after waiting for an hour. The food was good and very affordable. We ordered chicken lollypop, surmai tawa fry, malai kebab. Even after the restaurant being super busy, food was served in time."
5,We went with our kid and ordered Paneer chilly and fried rice which was good.. Overall I loved their staff behaviour.. All were so kind and friendly .. My son enjoyed their company...üòä
4,"Let's start from the ambience, still stays warm and welcoming as it was...a slight crack for improvement but can be neglected as it's just we'll designed

Next the Service, very transparent and attentive service given by this place. Place was a bit crowded as Saturday night but still got impressed.

Accompaniments:- Peanuts and chakli along with Schezwan sauce and green chutney

Vegetable Shorba:- A great texture and full of veggies contrast of spices. And I would recommend having it with tobassco sauce and lemon. A must have

Wine:- I had some sula white wine

Veg talumein:- I would describe it as one of the best clear soups I've had I really liked it...Only down fact that we ordered it without mushrooms but still served us with it.. wouldn't matter much cuz we didn't have any allergies but could've been a big prob if you have one( reason:- busy restraunt)
Vegetable grill plater:- assortment was great, marinate hit the spot,spices on the point..But again mushrooms were added even though we denied..This ignorance could lead to big problems but I'm sure if you look into it this will resolve.

Mini vadas:- smooth potato chunky filling with a nice crust of besan from outside...just perfect we personally liked this one .

Icecream:- it tasted good but not sure hich company it is as it's served in scoop style

So to conclude this restraunt has always lived upto my expectations let be the service,food or staff it's one of the good restraunts to suggest in whole of Dombivi,Thankyou"
4,"Good place to have authentic Chinese food. I saw many families here enjoying great food. Close to Dombivli East near Anand Balbhavan.

Needs to improve service asap. Team does not have time to cater to each table. They take lot of time even to serve water.

Interior is really good but music is not so good.

Rest everything is good.

Thanks üôèüèº
RJ"
4,"As the name implies, they specialize in Chinese cuisine. The ambiance is pleasant, accompanied by soothing background music. Here's what we ordered:
- Lotus Stem Crispy: Crispy with a subtly sweet flavor.
- Paneer Black Pepper: Soft paneer served with a mix of vegetables.
- Mojito: Refreshing with a perfect balance of mint and lemon.
- Burnt Garlic Rice: Tasty rice with Veg sizzling in parsley sauce.
- Hakka Noodles: Perfectly seasoned with minimal oil.

The serving time is very slow, and at times, it felt like the hunger for the food had faded while waiting."
4,"Dining here for the first time, I was impressed by the interiors and ambience m. Waiters were attentive and were getting everything swiftly.

For starters, we ordered Chicken Teriyaki which was delicious and Chicken Tom Yum soup which was tasty but could be slightly tangier.

For mains, we had Paneer Chilly with Veg Fried Rice and Chicken Chilly Garlic Noodles and both were amazing in taste. The flavours were well-balanced and had all the essence of Indo-Chinese cuisine.

We also ordered a Prawn Tempura Roll and Fresh Lime soda. The sushi roll was crunchy and flavourful and came with wasabi and pickled garlic which was delicious.

Highly recommend this place üëå"
3,"Mid food great ambience.
A bit oily food, okay taste but amazing ambience and great varieties in veg and non veg Chinese food.
Taste could've been better."
5,"I Ordered Fried Sehzwan rice üçõ
The quantity is fine for 4-6 person
But Full tummy enough for 2 person Quality was Good and authentic Chinese foodüçú ,
Cost is little higher but can be paid for quality) but spoon  was not provided ü§åin photo that's my home's spoon ü•Ñ
But for Take away it could be problem to eat without spoon
Taste was perfect as of expectationsüòã!
üë¨Staff are little uncooperative be aware u talk polite to them ü´£"
4,"I visit this place quite frequently as I love subway sandwiches. I mostly try the veg options here. This time I took the basic Aloo patty sandwich and I was surprised when they said that you will not get all veggies in this sandwich. So basically there was no olives, pickles, jalapenos, etc.  They compensated it with a lot of lettuce though and added all the sauces. It tasted good but I missed olives specially. The service and atmosphere as always is good.

Note: Exotic veggies are excluded for pregnant ladies hence it was not included in my sandwich. Kudos to the staff for being so thoughtful."
2,"Ordered through Zomato.
Taste was good but packing was worst.
There was no cello tape or anything, just a box.
This may lead food tampering or other unsafe practices.
There should be different packaging for delivery  services like Zomato or Swiggy.
Brand like Subway must think about it and act."
5,"Excellent service, good quantity and taste and calm ambience. üëçüèª"
5,Excellent outlet and Aryan who is the maker is doing great job. Must recommended.
4,"Very nice ambience. This subway outlet is at very prime location which is just 2-3 minutes away from the dombivli station. Taste is very good and hygiene is maintained as well.

There is no place to park a four wheeler easily, but two wheeler parking is easily available."
3,From outside it looks like just a small restaurant but it has really amazing variety of dishes which even good polished restaurants doesn‚Äôt serve in Dombivli. Taste was too yumn with good quality and its budget friendly restaurant. Little care need to take about cleanliness as you enter you see its shabby n messy where one may refuse to enter. Staff need to be trained and polished to look professional.
5,"Lovely food forever.
the food was very nice.
Whatever you order it will take time to prepare and serve you.
Perfect place to enjoy the food.
Definetly going to visit again ."
4,Very Good Experience nice ambiance just Service was Quiet delayed There is just one person to take Orders and Serve Food But overall nice food We tried Garlic Bread and Burgers all are soo good
5,"This cozy little restaurant is a hidden gem! The food tastes amazing flavorful, well-cooked, and served in generous portions that truly satisfy. It's the kind of place where every dish feels like it‚Äôs made with care.

The ambience is warm and inviting, perfect for catching up with friends or enjoying a relaxed evening out. The interior has a trendy, comfortable vibe that naturally attracts a younger crowd, giving the place a lively yet chill atmosphere.

If you're looking for a spot that serves delicious food, has a great vibe, and is perfect for laid-back hangouts, this place should definitely be on your list!"
1,"I ordered k&k special chicken dum biryani
They served all neck piece
I asked the person to change it but he was no ready to change it and was rude
Poor customer service
Poor food quality"
5,"Al Fresco, located near Dombivli East railway station, offers a cozy open-air dining experience with a charming, photogenic ambiance. While the outdoor seating adds to the appeal, it can get a bit noisy and warm due to its location by the main road. The food takes a little time to arrive, but the taste and quality make it worth the wait.

The menu features a variety of delicious options, with the pesto pasta, peri peri french fries, and thin-crust pizzas being popular choices. The pizzas are tasty but have a very thin crust, so they might not be as filling. The cheese garlic bruschetta and veg fingers with mint mayo are also highly recommended.

Despite the slightly higher prices, Al Fresco's atmosphere and courteous staff make it a great spot for a peaceful evening or a quick date. The overall experience is enjoyable, making it a place worth visiting occasionally for good food in a relaxed setting."
4,3.5/5 can visit occasionally. Pizza tastes nice but too thin. Pasta is recommended if you can‚Äôt choose what to eat. Photogenic ambience.
4,"Al Fresco is a cozy spot near Dombivali East railway station. It's named after the open-air vibe it offers, with outdoor seating by the main road. Keep in mind, though, that it can get a bit noisy and warm due to the outdoor setup.

The food takes a bit longer to arrive, but the taste is totally worth it. The menu is packed with delicious options that make up for any wait.

Prices are a tad high, but you're paying for quality ingredients and the experience.

Don't forget to say hi to their friendly dog, Laura. She adds a nice touch to the place.

To sum it up, Al Fresco near Dombivali East station gives you an open-air dining experience, though it can be a bit noisy and warm. The food is yummy, the prices are a bit high, and Laura the dog is a bonus!"
5,Food was very good in taste. Atmosphere was very nice. I had try pizza it was very thin. I suggest you should taste Veg finger and cheese corn nuggets it was very much yummy.
5,"You can visit this place if you are looking for a peaceful evening out or a quick  date, they had a variety of food/ drinks & beverage options. The ambience was good, the food was tasty . I personally tried the pesto pasta which stood out and met my expectations, secondly we tried peri peri french fries and veg fingers, veg fingers came with a mint mayo which was really nice, alsoo tried ice tea"

5,"I ordered a chocolate truffle cake for my daughter's birthday. I am so glad that I ordered from celebration cake shop. Everyone loved the cake it was not like the ordinary chocolate truffle cake which we usually get.

The cake was so moist and absolutely delicious üòã all her friends loved the taste and wanted more and more.

I had ordered a customised cake and it was made so pretty and perfect.

The taste of cake was horrible. It was like , I am taking some medicine or what.
Kindly have some quality taste check before selling it to customer.
Do not fool customers by selling such cheap products."
5,We always buy our cakes from this shop & they keep very good fresh variety. One can get lost admist the  cakes into a dreamy world! Our experience has been good.
1,Bakwaas ! Making Mockery of chat Items ! Shows Attitude to customers as if he owns the street. Municipality / Gram Panchayat should remove such vendors !No action being taken on these street vendors..they killed all trees around them. Hate them all for having no civic sense. Swacha bharat abhiyaan going waste here !!

5,Real good quality street taste.
5,Great sandwichs in open spaceüòç‚ù§
5,Taste is nice
5,"We visit here frequently, and it's located right opposite the garden. The seating area is small, with only two tables, but the food makes up for it. They offer a healthy twist on popular dishes, using wheat bread or wheat roti. The taste is really good, and the wait time is minimal. The server is polite and always helpful in suggesting good dishes. We tried the Schezwan noodle frankie with wheat roti, garlic bread, grilled sandwich, and pizza ‚Äì all of which were delicious."
4,"Good taste and variety of frankies.
Been a customer for many years.
They have two outlet one serves veg food [ opp lenskart], behind the road another outlet which veg, non veg and egg frankies and other fast food.
They contain good varities of veg, panner, egg, noodle and chicken frankies etc.
One of the best shop in dombivli for frankie/rolls, pizza, fries, garlic bread, sandwich etc, especially Frankie."
1,"Cheesy French fries was so bad.I went there to have some cheesy French fries. It was a takeaway. As I opened the fries I saw the cheese was not at all melted not even a 1‚ÑÖ. So, I let it in the microwave for 1 minute and instead of the cheese getting melted cheese became stiff."
5,"If you want to judge from the aspect of a restaurant this is not the place for you.
This place has a sitting capacity for 12 I think.
But the food is amazing!! Their wheat frankies or sandwiches/garlic bread, etc.
I always have a blast whenever I try their food.
My favourite item is the wheat chicken egg Frankie (or something like that)
You wouldn't be disappointed by their food that's for sure.
Give it a try."
3,"Another small quick snack joint to pacify hunger.They have variety of sandwiches , toast and grill at quite reasonable price.I ordered c chilli cheese toast sandwich.They have regular bread and brown bread options for those who are fitness freak or wants to stay fit and healthy.Staff friendly.Service good.Nice experience.They serve the sandwich with chutney and sauce.The place looks hygienic."

1,"Choco lava cake was full rubbery while eating. It was not fresh. I am a regular customer of monginis but this is the first time had this bad experience. I guess this store doesn't sell fresh cakes. I bought Dutch pastry, Dutch almond pastry and choco lava cake."
1,"Expired cake seller. I have bought rasmali cake worth Rs.470/half kg on 06 Sept 2022, All dry fruits are spoiled, rasmali also spoiled. Very very bad experience with Monginis. Spolied entire birthday celebration and we thrown entrie cake in dustbin. I am regular customer of Monginis but from now onwards I will never go to Monginis and I will suggest all my friends & family not to Monginis. Monginis do regular audits in your all branches."
5,This is the only place you can get pure chocolate cake. Staffs here are friendly and they also have delivery options.
5,"Delicious cake. All verity available.
Sharp delivery"
1,"I had purchased dutch chocolate cake worth rs 370. But after eating it cause food poisoning and vomitting within 1 hr.
This monginis shop is selling expired cake and can't trust on them with quality cakes.
I will suggest not to buy. They are playing with peoples health. I will never buy any cake from monginis from now onwards."
5,Best Cake And taste was Very nice and Worth Price higher recommend Go and Visit Ribbons and Balloons Cake Shop
1,"Today had a cake that someone else purchased from the outlet. It did not smell good to start with, the cream tasted stale and the red/pink colour just stuck to our hands and tongue. Noone enjoyed the cake at all. A very unpleasant experience."
1,"I ordered 1 kg cake a week ago. And, also confirmed the order a day ago. At the day of delivery the person from Ribbons and balloons said he doesn't  has my 1 kg cake order. He said,I didn't paid for it. Then why didn't he told me at the time I ordered the cake. Ribbons and balloons has disappointed me this second time. Please have a good management first. I will not recommend this shop ever again. These people don't understand the seriousness of someone's birthday. Plus the shopkeeper told me that is not his problem. Very bad service"
1,"Nowadays they don't bother to maintain their cakes quality and standards.Yesterday bought a cake from there was not fresh by test it seems to have of 3 days old. It has happened earlier too but repetation of mistake can't be considered an mistake, it's an bad practice leading to customer disatisfaction."
1,Ordered a special cake and it was pathetic in taste. Regular cakes are ok.
2,"Slow service and average place to have food.

I ate paneer crispy. Was ok and high in vinegar not able to enjoy it. Later i had stomache üòµ‚Äçüí´

Then i ate cheese corn fried momos... Those were good...
They were good bcoz it was readymade just have to fried and served wale so that's why i guess.

Didn't like their schezwan chutney at all again at a higher side of vinegar in it... Timepass bhi acchese khane nahi mila üôÉ

Later, manager asked for they having new one desert which was Chocolate Mousse...
He said it's not yet in the menu but we are servung then he showed photo... I said ok 60 rs ka hi hai, lao...
He went straight to the cake shop which is infront of hotel anf bring that üôÑ...
And that was khatta in taste ü§¢ not fresh.....!!!

He didn't even asked after suggesting to have it like did u like it or not or how's it?

I only told him it was stale and didn't like it. After that too he didn't even bothered and still charged in the bill that 60 rs.
Very frustarting and disgusting experience for me...

Bill was 400 rs.
around for 2 including 4 waterbottles.

I don't know but the time enter here from that time i was having feeling it's not good to have food here."
1,"We ordered banjara kabab, malai kabab along with masala lollipops.
Those kabab almost tasted like boiled chicken not even found a fragrance of tandoori in it, whereas lollipops tastes better than those kababs.
Total meal costs us 850 rs
Not recommended for tandoori items."
2,"Well the food was good, pretty great quantity.

And thats the only good part unfortunately. Service is straight up bad.

No cleanliness either, the plates gave out crazy amount of oil residue when we decided to wipe the plate with a tissue paper. Died cockroach on the table.

Even the seats were uncomfortable to sit on, rather replace those seats with a plastic chair.

I would recommend order food, or take away. Dine in experience is terrific."
1,"Worst place to have food, i completely do not recommend anyone to go here, I was served rotten chicken which was smelling bad n visible rotten chicken, bad quality food. I suffered food poisoning."

It was similar as other Bar & Restaurant category.
Means food lovers will disappoint a bit here.
I doubt their Cook was either on leave that day or they hired a very average category cook. (Vegetarian)

However I would appreciate the Manager & the Serving Staff behaviour. They take of all your need"
5,"My friend recommend this newly opened Restaurant so my family decided to give a try.My experience at the Restaurant was nothing  short of exceptional. From the moment we arrived until we left my family felt pampered  by the food and service.The ambience of this Restaurant is simply fantastic.The cozy atmosphere ,soft lighting  and the elegant decor  makes the perfect sitting for any special occasion. They have a banquet too for those who looking to celebrate. After the great experience me and my wife has decided to celebrate our daughter's 10th birthday  in Celebration and we already booked it just cnt wait to come back there.Only disappointment was they dnt have much choices on dessert."
4,"Good ambience.good food.

This place is now Royal family resto bar."
5,"Decent Ambiance, Hygiene & really delicious food served over here with variety of veg & non veg options üòãüòãüòã‚Ä¶.

Quality of everything served was great along with prompt service by the courteous staff has made this place my favourite destination to dine in.

Also this place has a large party hall with ample capacity for various gatherings, parties, family functions etc‚Ä¶

Will highly recommend this place to everyone   ‚ù§Ô∏è ü§ó"
1,"Dear Domino's Team
I am writing to express my disappointment with the service and cleanliness during my recent visit to your [location name] on [date].

Firstly, I was extremely dissatisfied with the service I received. The staff seemed disorganized and unprofessional, and I had to wait an unreasonably long time before my order was even acknowledged. Additionally, the staff seemed uninterested in providing a positive customer experience, which made my visit even more frustrating.

Furthermore, I was appalled by the state of cleanliness at the store. The dining area was dirty, with tables and floors in need of cleaning. It was clear that proper hygiene practices were not being followed, which is a serious concern, especially in the current times. A clean and welcoming environment is fundamental to a positive dining experience, and unfortunately, this was not the case during my visit.

As a loyal customer of Domino's, I hope this feedback is taken seriously, and improvements are made both in terms of service and cleanliness at this location. I look forward to seeing positive changes in the near future.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
Ishwar Shirsat"
1,"I recently had a very frustrating experience at Domino's in Dombivli. I tried to order a 4-course meal, but the employee Pooja told me it was out of stock, even though I've ordered it before without any issues. To my surprise, I found the 4-course meal available on the app. Instead of getting what I wanted, I had to order the 5-course meal, which cost me an extra 90 rupees! This lack of communication is unacceptable and really disappointing. I hope management addresses this issue for better service in the future.

Staff name :- Pooja Lodhe"
4,"We ordered a Veg Extravaganza pizza and a Veg Paneer Tandoori pizza, both with a cheese burst crust. For sides, we got garlic bread with cheese dip and some Pepsi. The improved crust has been delicious, and we've been loving the taste. However, there were very few attendants to take orders. During delivery, there was only one person serving seven groups. Air condition can be improved. The staff is very friendly, but some improvements are needed for the best customer experience."
3,"I'm a regular here. Most of the air conditioners are always non-functional. Other than that everything is nice and clean and the ambience is pretty welcoming. The food is good, the service is nice too. The staff is very welcoming. Only the air seems suffocating because of the broken air conditioners"
1,"Not a good experience..
1) Ac not working properly.
2) You have to buy pepsi glass, if you want pepsi bottle you need to order via app. Even the glass pepsi is not cold, and they don't provide ice. We had a warm pepsi with warm pizza. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
3) Staff slow and careless.
4) Don't take instructions properly.
5) Tables are not cleaned until next customer comes.
6) QR scanning issues."
3,Good ambience... humble waiters ... bit service is lil bit slow ... food is mouth watering... crab tandoori is lit af üòç .. tried cocktail blue curraco which is too good as compared to other bar serving cocktails... family section is separate.. fully ac n non ac available.. non veg food n sea food is best here in town .. veg crispy is also good .. pure veg food also available
5,"Good food, fast service...we had order sea food, it was fresh, dal khichdi as well. There is a seperate smoking room for people who wish to smoke which is good thinking on the part of the owners. Washroom was clean."
4,"This family restaurant is based in industrial area of sonar pada, dombivli. This restaurant has speciality in local dishes specially in  fish food (they have that distinctive agari flavor in it). They serve variety of food in non veg/veg. It has separate family fine dine and AC rooms as per one wishes. This restaurant serves variety alcoholic cocktails and equally great non alcoholic mocktails(for non alcoholic folks like me)."
3,"Average experience. Lighting could be better.
Food quantity is relatively less as compared to prices and the class of the restaurant and bar. Chakna is worst. They will literally count 15 -17 pea nuts and serve as complimentary. Table sizes are on smaller side. Taste wise food quality is average. Liquor is not too expensive."
5,It is one of my favorite restaurants in Dombivli.  It's located on kalyan Shil highway.  Slightly difficult to locate but you can follow Google Map and it's easy to access. They serve veriety of dishes with slight Konkani touch.  The neer dosa with chicken or veg gravy is must try dish here. We had celebrated our two family functions here previously and the staff was very cooperative. Food is just amazing.  We visited the place yesterday itself and this time for our very surprise they gave us the taste of chicken gravy before serving it to ask if the gravy was okay to be served.
4,"Had fish fry and chicke65.

Chicken 65 was strikingly good juicy and taste was perfect. Famous for bombil fry.

Mutton biryani was okay bit on sweeter side masala i guess due to excessive onion"
5,"Prashant Bar offers a delightful dining experience with a menu full of flavorful dishes. Each meal is cooked to perfection, leaving you craving more. The atmosphere is relaxed, and the staff is friendly and attentive. A must-visit spot for anyone looking for delicious food in a cozy setting!"
2,"Order chicken biryani and Dry lollypop.

The taste was not that good previously When I ordered the taste it was good but now the taste has deteriorated. Not recommended"
4,"A good place to hang out in group. Besides being a BAR this place serves the yummiest food to quest your hunger pangs. Delicious sea food and mangalorean food is the USP also chicken related dishes like chicken handi, chicken sukka and mutton handi are the best ."
4,It is a very small and congested area to spend time here but the AC room  in the upper stair was good at a reasonable price. Foods are not up to level but can enjoy one time
1,"07th Nov'24
One of the most 3rd class food ever had in dombivli. I would have provided minus rating for the food that I ordered.
We ordered chicken lolipop which was fried with fish and it smelled liked dip with a red fish and fried without knowing.
Naan was not eatable & not even cooked properly and chicken masala tasted like it was cooked way back and heated just to serve.

Please be careful and trust me please don't order. I almost wasted 609rs and almost had to wait for one hour.
This is really disappointing."
5,Decent place to grab couple of drinks with friends. They also have staters to go with the drinks and after your drinks you can grab decent nonveg and veg dishes for lunch or dinner.
5,"Decent place to hang out friends.
Affordable food ,nice atmosphere, cooperative staff."
4,Didn't visited the Bar and Resturant. Just was waiting here for some pick-up. Good outside place and location.
1,The staf was very bad and owner also don't go there go on royal restaurant &bar the y was good
5,"I had an amazing experience at Hotel banana leaf, a true paradise for vegetarian travelers! From the moment I arrived, the hospitality was warm and welcoming. The staff was courteous and went above and beyond to make my stay comfortable.

The highlight of my visit was undoubtedly the food. The restaurant serves a wide variety of delicious pure vegetarian dishes, all prepared with fresh ingredients and authentic flavors. the mouth-watering snacks, or the healthy breakfast options, every meal was a treat. They even catered to special dietary requests, making the experience even more personalized.

The hotel was clean, spacious, and well-maintained, offering a peaceful ambiance.

I highly recommend  Hotel banana leaf to all vegetarian travelers looking for a fantastic food. Will definitely be coming back!"
5,"We enjoyed two servings of veg dum biryani, paneer crispy, veg crispy, jeera rice, and dal fry for 6 people. The food was fantastic, and the portions were generous. It was my first experience eating off a banana leaf restaurant , and it was absolutely worth it."
1,Biryani was rice mixed with red coloured rice mix with spicy gravy and little vege annoying food for kids
3,"The food at the place is good as compared to the price.
The reason to give them 3 stars is because i have ordered medu wada sambhar and they came up with medu wada which was cold and was stiff to cut so i asked them to change and have me hot one, again they came up with the same cold one i got irritated and told them to take it and i am leaving, after that they told me they are bring the hot one and they come up with freshly prepared medu wada
When we are paying a price we should get what is right, not because they have leftovers they can feed is that
The only reason why I gave it 3 stars
Apart from that food is great and prices are competitive
Sitting could have been better as i felt like a 10th class student sitting on a 2nd class child bench, so sitting like this and eating was bit comfortable
Try it out if you want it in khau gali pendharkar road beside mamledar missal. This is a multi-cuisine restaurant but i can't review the food apart from South India as i haven't tasted anything apart from that

Thankyou"
5,"Food test was amazing üëè ü§©
Must try"
3,"One of the oldest restaurant near Dombivli station on busy Phadke Road with ample sitting area with AC non AC sitting facilities but no 4 wheeler parking and few 2 wheeler parking, if you find in nearby lanes or in front of restaurant. Established in 1962, it is pure veg restaurant and always busy serving Maharashtrian dishes especially Veg Thali. Though service and ambience of hotel is good but taste of Local veg thali is not upto the mark. I specifically visited this restaurant for their thali but except dal, no vegetables were upto the mark. Pulav was as good as just plain rice with some added vegetables without any flavour."
5,"If you wants to enjoy authentic south indian breakfast then must visit this place!
My personal favourite restaurant and it's very budget friendly."
3,"We sat in AC section and the ambience was good, however I dint like the taste of food. I ordered veg crispy it was bit sweet, even veg biryani was not up to date. Otherwise all other things are good, they have valet Parking and washroom in restaurant"
1,"I placed this entire food order for my mom because she was craving something delicious, and I wanted to surprise her. Unfortunately, the experience was far from what I had hoped. I ordered Pav Bhaji with extra pav, but instead, she received salty pav, which she could barely eat.

To make matters worse, the bhaji, which I had specifically requested to be less spicy, turned out to be nothing more than tomato puree. I‚Äôve ordered less spicy food from many other places, and they always manage to maintain the flavor of the dish. However, this was a complete letdown and ruined both the surprise and her lunch.

Given how popular this restaurant is in our area, I expected much better. This experience has left me deeply disappointed and questioning my decision to order from here."
5,"This is the best hotel in Dombivli. Even though there's mad rush food quality, taste & service remains very consistent. Very consistent taste since last 10 yrs. We  are specially visiting this hotel from Kalyan because of the Lovely Quality, Taste and vibes."
5,
4,"Value for money , Quantity wise good, just sitting space is less , enjoy dining in for better experience"
5,"Food quality, service, staff behavior best.. If you think Fried chicken this is best place for chicken lover... Must try hot crispy burger"
3,The place was just ok. Nothing to take home about. 4 tables neatly kept. Great service though. Taste was ok not amazing. Price was ok. Not super cheap or anything just slightly less than on par with KFC. But good to try couple of times.
1,"I ordered at 12:15pm it arrived at 1:15pm .
Took about 1 hr.. alright understandable...
The food is false advertises all over the menu and it's all raw and frozen ...
I ordered 5 things :

Chicken crispy burger-it was a pre cooked frozen burger which was just heated .(image uploaded)

Tandoori chicken roll- only thing that was worth 70rs i paid of it and it was edible atleast.

Cheesy chicken shots- frozen deep fried cheese shots...not chicken

Chicken roll- it was raw. the forzen  deep fried chicken wasn't even fully cooked and it smelled like fishh !!?

Masala fries- good fries

I had so much expectations while ordering
But the food was barely edible. Wasn't worth 300rs final order amount... regret it very much ."
1,"Total waste of money, No taste for food , no fresh chicken, it smells bad , we found hair in fried chicken ‚Ä¶ personally I didn‚Äôt like it not recommended"
3,Taste was good. Quantity was average. Hygine was maintained. Good packaging for parcel orders. Seating capacity is limited to 5-6 people only. Limited menu. But all vegetarian dishes they serve.
5,Few days I had the opportunity to be in the same area as this outlet is and I was very was pretty much hungry so I went in with open mind. The ambiance is quite good. The food I ordered where Signature roll and Chicken Tikka roll with french fries and Chocolate Shake. Signature roll is good but Chicken Tikka roll is quite tasty and delicious. Apart from Mac's i never liked anyone's french fries but there fries were crispy and I liked it. Chocolate shake also very good. Overall I had the the best food. Do try it out.
5,"Visited London Rolls in Dombivli and loved the paneer roll! The fries were crispy, and the milkshake was a refreshing treat. Also tried the Pahadi Veg Roll‚Äîspicy and delicious! Great spot for roll lovers"
1,"I ordered a signature veg roll What i received was uncooked roti and onion no lettuces no asian flavour which was promised, No sauces restaurant didn't even bother to oven the parcel before handing it over to delivery guy it was just roti and onion.and full part is i ordered cheese burst still not an ounce of cheese. simply waste of money i don't have any option to give minus marking so 1 star I feel is generous from myside. i would recommend not to order and check some other resturant like fasoos and even ovenstory."
2,"Pictures and food dont match. No veggies (except for onion and lettuce) in roll. Pictures show lettuce, onion, tomatoes, green and red capsicum, olives etc."
5,"Perfect tangy taste and affordable prices with lots of varieties, must come"
4,"I visited the place on New year, so it's obvious that the place was fully occupied. Grabbed a corner seat and ordered cold coffee and red sauce pasta. Both the items were good. Place is quite small however the food  was above expectation. Service was good and the price is also affordable. Overall I had a good experience visiting the place and will surely visit again."
5,"Ordering from here for 4-5th time now. Had ordered pink sauce pasta via Swiggy today, as the place is nearby, food got delivered on time. Pasta was warm. About the quantity, it was sufficient for 2 people and tastewise, pasta was creamy and had the perfect white and red sauce flavours with some veggies in it. Outlet had provided extra oregano and chilly flakes too along with a sweet thankyou card.  Overall a good place for quick hunger fixes!"
5,"It's a really cool place for a hangout with friends and family. Very cute and instagrammable.

I tried multiple things starting from cheese garlic bread which has a really good  cheese spread and Farmhouse pizza. Ice Tea Lemon is very refreshing. I even tried Chocolava cake dessert and this is a must try."
5,"It's a good place to visit with friends. They serve vegetarian food. The food is delicious. Food quality n quantity is good as per the cost.
Me and my friend ordered farmhouse pizza which was delicious and also ordered hazelnut cold coffee and brownie shake which were awesome.
It's good dining with affordable prices."
5,"I recently visited Happy Slice and was really impressed with both the food and the overall experience. The food is top-notch‚Äîfresh, and made with quality ingredients. I highly recommend the paneer pizza‚Äîit‚Äôs delicious! What makes it even better is that Happy Slice is the perfect spot to hang out with friends. The cozy ambiance and friendly service make it a great place to relax and enjoy a meal together. Plus, it‚Äôs really budget-friendly, offering great value without compromising on quality. I‚Äôll definitely be back!"
5,"One of the best dosas in dombivli, one should definitely try..."
5,"Awesome Delicious Tasty Food, Nice variety of dosas & frankie, Everyone must try, you all loved it too.
Best Part is Jain option also available in some variety of dosas & frankie,
You can order online on swiggy & zomato."
5,"All items Dhosa, Frankie, noodles's Test is too much tasty... Space n all neat & clean... Service is good and all r polite & co-operative person... Visit once you will be happy."
5,Delicious breakfast. Each and every item is tasty.
4,Superb taste and hygiene is also ok. Best in this locality.
1,When asking for price need to tell to the customer. Do not serve before that . In 40 Rs. I can eat 2 plate somewhere else
3,Great Taste
1,So bad experience ... Bady
4,its was good
3,Average shop
5,"I tried Appam , neer dosa, Mysore masala dosa, and pizza dosa . I just loved it . Specially the Sambar was So Amazing. üòç Guys must go and try üåü"
5,"Superb quality and quantity of food, sure I will visit  again"
4,Good food
1,
5,
5,Too Good We ordered Dosa's very Good Taste Must Visit Place ‚ù§Ô∏è
1,"Pathetic‚Ä¶.ordered Paneer butter masala and it was just oil, Even zomato refunded on immediate basis. As per hotel they prepare the same way"
4,"Basically it is authentic South Indian hotel. It provides Variety in South Indian, Punjabi and Chinese dishes. Their speciality is in South Indian dishes. The taste is awesome, Quality is the best but a bit improvement needed in case of quantity...

Overall it it a good experience and if you're a South Indian foodie then you should definitely try it out..."
5,"We've been to this place roughly six months ago and got everything that tasted fresh and delicious. We ordered Achari Idli, Ragi Dosa and Filter Coffee and everything was perfect. The place is clean. They have a seating on first floor which is air conditioned and quiet. There is a lot of variety of South Indian dishes.   There are half of the dishes on the menu that we've never even heard of. Overall, a good place to munch on something healthy and quick food."
4,"The food at this restaurant is amazing as it's a multi-cuisine restaurant that serves thali  between 12:30pm-3:30 pm which is affordable and yet delicious too,you can have an amazing food with a cool and cozy shed in summers as outside there is scorching heat,
They have various desert options, falooda options too.
The only negative i found there is the place  of sitting which is too limited for a multi-cuisine restaurant
The quality and the quality and the pricing of the food is amazing
You should definitely try it once

Thankyou"

5,"I am OBSESSED! The only cafe in Dombivali serving healthy stuff!!
I've visited this cute little cafe so many times. I just loved the menu card detailing the calculation of protein, carbs, fiber and calories for each and every dish. The food is really healthy and delicious though. And the best part is they provide FREE home delivery with rewards!!!!"
5,"I ordered Fiery Paneer Meal... from DietShayet Cafe today.... Must say one of the best diet meals I had. The taste, portion and service... Complete 10/10... Definitely recommend it to all..."
5,"I tried a  simple eggwich sandwich here and the taste was amazing.
Menu is designed with accurate calorie and macro track which makes it easy to count my daily calories.
I am also enrolling in their subscription plan which will help me in my fitness journey."
5,"The best budget friendly fitness cafe in dombivli.
Taste, Quantity, Pricing is 10/10.
I highly recommend Diet Shayet Cafe for all the people out there.
Your health is your priority.."
5,"Ordered peanut butter toast and banana peanut butter shake

Both were too yummy perfect combination of both toast and shake
Good quality of food . Chef keep going"
5,"Chandrahas is one of the well known Home made food corner on Manpada road opposite Gaodevi mandir. Currently it is not fully operational but take out orders are available till 10 PM. You might see half shutter closed after 4PM but they allow take outs.

You can visit this place with family and friends. The sitting is not available. Only take out/ parcel is available.

The must try dishes from the shop are,
1. Tandul Bhakri,
2. Ghavne,
3. Puran poli

You can find 3/4 varieties of curry/sabji/bhaaji. You can try vadapav also.

They accept ONLY cashüí≤
No accessible entrance ‚ôø‚ùå"

5,Best pain Puri  my 120 pleat order so testi pain puri
4,Good exchange of appetite for quality. Nice service.
1,"We ordered panipuri. He serves panipuri so fast that before you pick one puri, other 2-3 puris are already lying in your plate. Are bhai train pakadna hai kya? Tasteless water. Saltless ragda. Third class. Never again."
4,Vry good jain options available here
5,I've been eating here for many many years and their quality has remained the exact same. Really great taste. But their real USP is how they greet and treat their customers with warmth and remember all their favourite dishes and their customisations.
3,"We Ordered Chicken Thali (250), Prawns Thali (330) and Chicken Biryani (160)
It took them 55 mins to cook this small order.
The Chicken Biryani was good. Prawns Thali gravy was very okay also the size of the prawns in gravy was very small but we were told the size is big as per the charges. Chicken Thali was average. Solkadi was missing from both the Thalis also, no lemon and onions were provided which is a must with non veg food. We asked chapatis instead of bhakris but they only gave chapati for 1 thali and didn't even inform us that chapati was not available.
After calling them and informing about all this they said will adjust this in the next order.
They serve Good hygenic homely food but they need to improve a lot in their time management, awareness and communication if they really want to survive in today's competition and they can't keep customers waiting for almost an hour!!!
Will try their food 1 more time and give them a chance and see if this is just a one time mistake.
ALL THE BEST üëçüèª"
1,Exorbitantly high pricing. Take too much time to deliver. Got cheated in Surmai Size. Rs. 190 for very small fish piece.
5,Authentic Malvani taste. hygienically prepared fresh fish. Tasty veggies too
1,The first time we had ordered chicken gravy/sukka turned out to be quite worth for money. But today we ordered the same dish and shockingly the dish tasted/smelled absurd. Didn't even replace the dish with freshly cooked one. Would've been better option to refund the money back. Atleast could've tried to accept the management's mistake. Highly disappointed.
3,"Food was good but I was expecting malvani taste which is more of mangolarian taste,
I had checken thali. Which had 1 rice flour bhakri,white rice, chicken sukha, chicken rassa, Solkadi, Onion lemon , jovla.
For Rs. 220.
Chicken sukha was more of mangolarian taste but good in taste.
Chicken rassa was not good in taste.
Jovla was nice.
Bhakri was perfectly made n hot.
Solkadi was bit down I guess it's due to hot temperature.
Overall good experience."
3,"Overall experience is satisfactory, good interiors. There is a separate AC and Non AC section. We ordered Chicken Manchow Soup it was really good. Chicken Crips was good too. Chicken lolipop was a bit underwhelming as the batter was really thick we could taste more of the batter and less of the chicken itself. Service was satisfactory but can be faster. 3 stars from my end"
5,"chicken lollipop masala dry is best here.
it is spicyüî•
service should be improved"
4,"A small place with affordable prices and good taste!!
They have a half plate of almost all the things in d menu which is good quantity for 1 person!! Veg manchurian dry is one thing I would recommend to try!! Along with chicken lollipop in gravy style(can‚Äôt name it exactly) is too good!! Though a compact place for dine in,gets really hot in summer so opt for AC room"
5,"Has been favorite since 2009, back then it was Kaka's kitchen.. and is still in the favourite's list !"
5,Very good and quality food at affordable rates. Positive atmosphere. Taste of the food is very good.

Somewhere felt over costly as per taste."
1,"I had ordered panner 65 medium size. Bad experience, too low toppings. I had asked for triple treat bonanza (cheese Burst) and paid 130 rupees extra but to our surprise there was hardly any cheese.
I had ordered coz i had amazing experience when we ordered the same from kalina branch even the base was so soft.
Felt as i was cheated.
Very bad, please dont order, just waste of money."
1,This is the worst pizza I have ever had . They just basically buy the pizza base from outside and add just some insufficient amount of veggies and cheese in it . I was not able to eat the pizza without the oregano and chilli flakes. There was no such taste of its . I bought there global galaxy coupon booklet of 700 which was my stupidest choice.
1,"Very rude staff, I actually hate the taste of pizza it was so weird who TF made this a food chain, staff extremely ignorant don't really care about customers very bad experience :("
1,"The worst pizzas available in Dombivli. Really pathetic oily, looks disgusting as if its made ages ago.... on top of that some buffoons from Galaxy golbal (one of their franchise partnerns) might visit your locality for some coupon system for 699 PLS!!!! don't fall into their marketing trap even tough ure getting free pizzas based on coupons what the use if you ain't gonna enjoy them"
5,"Today we visit our friend restorent @Dombivli. They just started there new venture Swad Foods by  #Pritam Katke & #Mahesh Katke. We ordered there Special food ""Swad Special Chicken"".
