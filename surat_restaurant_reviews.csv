5,"I rarely give 5 stars. This restaurant reserved it. What a gem of a restaurant. Feeling very lucky to have found it among thousands of reataurants in Surat. Even though I rarely get to dine outside in Surat but this easily the best so far. The food was tasty - European but with a punch of Indian flavor. Was served by Kartik from shiliguri. He was excellent and as I write this review, I am feeling happy with full tummy. I ordered the lamb roast as main and it did not disappoint  me.
Plan to come back again if o get the chance. The surprising part was the menu which was sitting on the table looking like a newspaper - pleasant surprise. üòÄ
Thanks to the owners for creating such a place for us to enjoy.",,,,,,,,,
4,"This was my second visit to trezoro.. the most loved are pizzas and desserts of Trezoro.. they are a must try.. we ordered pesto sauce pizza which was chef special pizza, mock-tails containing cranberry mojito and pineapple mango sorbet both were not impressive also prices were high according to the taste so overall 4 star to food. We also tried guacamole sourdough toast which was tasty again portion size was very small..in desserts we tried classic Tiramisu which was absolute delight.. overall food was great but mocktails were not upto mark..",,,,,,,,,
1,The food served here is pathetic. There are egg shells in the food and any one knows what it can do. The valet parking guy dose not respond a car comes and we park ourselves and he is busy using his phone. When we say the coffee is made wrong the manager tells us hum toh aisa hi banate hai apko nahi pata hoga. The food portions are too small for some articles that it cant even feed a baby. We came here to have a good breakfast but we‚Äôre so disappointed that we wont recommend any one coming here. They served us a sandwich which was fridge cold. This is the worst service and food we have had.,,,,,,,,,
1,"Very bad experience, staff does not have serving etiquette, ordered pizza which was not up to the mark, almost soggy
When we tried to explain the manager instead of acknowledging our opinion he was stuck to his opinion how bad pizza they can make.
Won't come again here.",,,,,,,,,
5,"One of the best places for breakfast or brunch in Surat. The food quality is exceptional, with an extensive menu offering a wide variety of options. I had a fantastic time here. The staff is warm and attentive, and the service is truly top-notch.",,,,,,,,,
4,"Cool breeze drink was not like described. But still nice as a subtle drink

Passion ice tea was nice

Lamb burger was not up to expectations as a fine dine rest. Vegetables need to be cut thinner and smaller

Pasta was good

Taco starters was nice

Staff was very polite understanding.

Can also play board games.

Over all nice experience worth a try 8/10",,,,,,,,,
2,It's a great looking place with a perfect cafe ambience. They have created a good fine dining experience. But the food was very under par. They don't know how to make italian food. They are very overpriced for the quality of food they are serving. I would not recommend this place. This pizza that I have uploaded was not worth finishing also.,,,,,,,,,
5,"If you worship food, then you must visit this place. Your taste buds will be on cloud nine after trying treasures from the menu.  The taste is not usual, it‚Äôs no where near to what you eat everyday so take a first bite with an open mind, I am sure that you will fall in love with the whole experience. I was fortunate enough to meet and chat with owners. They have prepared/created each and every item in the menu which can be felt in minute details in the preparation of the food. I was blown away by the fact that they grow some of the ingredients in house, do not forget to ask about these home grown ingredients. The ambience of the place is welcoming for whole family, group of friends as well as for couples on their first date. Eat whatever you like, you will enjoy it but don‚Äôt miss the rose tart‚Ä¶. Any time of the day and any day of the week is perfect to visit this place. Parking is not a problem as they have valet parking.",,,,,,,,,
2,Overall food is too costly with compare to Similar restaurants..and taste was also not that up to the mark‚Ä¶location is good ‚Ä¶Place need maintenance and cleanliness‚Ä¶,,,,,,,,,
5,"This restaurant came in highly recommended by a local resident.
Great place for some casual dining & a good place to chill with friends & family.

The truffle fries were great, Pesto chicken pizza & the original margarita pizza were good!

Fried chicken wings were good too‚Ä¶

The soups were average & spaghetti pasta was OK!

Overall 5 stays for food & ambiance‚Ä¶

The customer service could have been a bit better. Especially related to the way The food was served‚Ä¶.
Instead of starting appetizers and soup first they served a pizza first, and then got the rest of the food randomly‚Ä¶
But overall decent service.

We met the two owners at the end of our meal and they were very personable and appreciated our visit and candid feedback.

Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant if you‚Äôre visiting Surat‚Ä¶",,,,,,,,,
5,"Trezoro is a must-visit destination in Surat for anyone seeking an exceptional Italian dining experience. The prawn risotto is an absolute highlight, perfectly creamy and bursting with flavor, while their chicken dishes are expertly cooked, tender, and seasoned to perfection. For vegetarians, the menu offers an array of delicious options, ensuring everyone finds something to savor.

The ambiance is just as impressive as the food. Set in a beautifully designed space, the interiors blend earthy tones, reclaimed wood, and greenery to create a warm and inviting atmosphere. Whether it‚Äôs a casual outing or a special occasion, Trezoro delivers an unforgettable dining experience with attentive service and a great vibe. Highly recommended!",,,,,,,,,
3,"Vibe of the place-great but the food is not that great.
The tiramisu croissant was a bummer coz it did not taste anything like tiramisu - too bitter and fully loaded with coffee poweder and cream
Tiramisu and croissant are the two things I love and when merged I expected something great but it wasn't.

The pizza was a bit different then routine and I personally liked it but my friends didn't as they found it similar to naan and chicken curry.

Hot chocolate had a thick layer of MALAAI on top of it...I had never seen one on top of a hot chocolate, normally seen on top of milk and tea when it boils and cools down.

Ordered a sandwich as well and it was fine.

Hazelnut shake was good",,,,,,,,,
4,"Trezoro has a welcoming vibe and the food didn‚Äôt disappoint. I tried the Mexican Tomato Soup, a bit cold but was flavorful with a nice warmth, and the Vegetable Lasagne, which was comforting and well‚Äëmade. The portions were generous and the ingredients tasted fresh.

One area for improvement would be the atmosphere. Adding some light background music could help elevate the dining experience and make the space feel more lively.

Overall, a solid pick for a tasty, satisfying meal with potential for a nicer ambiance.",,,,,,,,,
3,"Good place to hang out with friends..vintage and aesthetic ambience..great bakery and dessert options. Also, food little expensive but good in taste. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. Most of the food items are inspired by Italian food.

For those who are not fond of Italian food, this is not the place for them.  Those who are interested in exploring new food can enjoy visiting here once.",,,,,,,,,
3,Yesterday we visited this place. They have such a unique concept of menu. We ordered so many varieties from their menu. Like we tried Napoli whispering pizza üçï which was damnn good but the sauces served with it ..it guess it was same like marinara sauce it was good but the after taste was tingling on tongue. After that we ordered gnocchi but they didn't have it. So we ordered Fuseli Alfredo which was normal. Then we ordered a filet fish burger but again they didn't have it. So we ordered a grill shroom burger. It was really good like the patty and stuffing but the sauce eewww it was really overpowering. They said it is animal sauce but TBH it tasted something similar like mustard sauce. That made the taste of burger from wow to zero in seconds. We ordered pineapple kombucha which was like of 10days. we didn't like it much. Again we ordered pistachio caramel milkshake which was damn delicious. Then lastly we ordered salted caramel eclair but it felt stale. like the texture and even the taste you can tell it. The sauce and the chocolate didn't go well together. The flavour was bad. French cuisine is not worth it here ig. Italian was good üëçüèΩ,,,,,,,,,
5,"For every Non-Veg lover, you should be coming and trying here definitely! Each and every dish crafted with utmost care and the taste is justtt beyond what you will expect, do try it and it will be the best place that you would visitüëçüèªüëçüèª",,,,,,,,,

5,"Trezoro is a charming caf√© with a delightful European vibe, perfect for a cozy outing. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, with mood lighting and cute decor that adds to its charm.

The menu at Trezoro is impressive, offering a wide range of delicacies like pastries, cookies, breads, pizzas, and coffee. It‚Äôs a great spot for a first date, with a unique touch‚Äîicebreakers and conversation topics listed on the menu to help get things started.

We ordered the Truffle Treasure, one of the best Neapolitan pizzas I‚Äôve ever had. The combination of caramelized onions, marinara sauce, Mozzarella and Parmesan cheese, and cooked mushrooms topped with truffle oil was a classic delight.

To drink, I had the Vietnamese Cold Coffee, which was a balanced mix of espresso shots and condensed milk‚Äînot too sweet, just right. We also tried the Belgian Chocolate Milkshake, which was very, very good. It's on the sweeter side, so it‚Äôs perfect if you have a sweet tooth.

The service was quick and professional, with polite staff who made the experience even better.

Our final bill for two people came to Rs 1,536.

There is free valet parking available for four wheeler and ample parking space for two wheelers",,,,,,,,,
1,"""If you have a subpar product, market it as 'unique.'""

I made a regrettable decision to visit Trezoro for dessert with my family. We arrived around 10:45 PM on 06/07/2024 and ordered a hazelnut frappe coffee, hazelnut cheesecake, and a chocolate pastry.

Things were fine until we tasted the star dish of the night, the ‚ÄúChocolate Pastry‚Äù...

The chocolate pastry was so stale that even the chocolate tasted sour. I called a staff member over to complain and received one of the strangest responses: ‚ÄúSir, the beauty of Trezoro is that everything here is served differently.‚Äù I had to assertively explain that I ordered a simple chocolate pastry, I have visited many places, and chocolate should never taste sour unless there's an issue. After persistent complaints, he finally agreed to check the pastry and, by the grace of God, confessed that the pastry was indeed stale.

Here's the saddest part. They pulled out the magic wand that almost all eateries do: they refused to give me the bill and started arguing that they couldn't charge me because their service didn't meet my expectations. Here are my observations:

1. Every customer is not a freeloader. They come to your establishment to have a good time and are prepared to pay for it. Instead of making them feel like freeloaders, provide the dining experience they seek.
2. By waiving the bill, they incurred multiple losses. They lost the food cost to prepare the items. Only one dish had an issue, so they could have removed that item from the bill. They didn‚Äôt because it wasn‚Äôt coming out of their (staff‚Äôs) pocket.
3. They inadvertently promoted a freeloading culture by implying that one could argue about the food or service to get free items.
4. They lost a potential returning customer due to unnecessary arguments at multiple points.

Nothing is perfect, but that doesn't mean feedback should be ignored or easy escape routes should be taken when faults are found.

My only takeaway from yesterday‚Äôs visit is that I now have to convince my young child, who loves chocolate pastries, that not all chocolate pastries are bad.",,,,,,,,,

5,"We visited this place for lunch and had an amazing experience!

‚ú® Starters: We started with Peri Peri French Fries and they were absolutely delicious! üî•

üçï Main Course: We ordered the Cottage Cheese Nepolian Pizza, and I must say, it was next-level! The thin crust was perfectly crisp, and the flavors were just incredible. Along with that, we tried the Green Onion Mac & Cheese Pasta, which was super creamy and flavorful.

üç∞ Desserts: The highlight of our meal was the Tiramisu‚Äîone of the best I‚Äôve had in Surat! We also tried the **Dark Chocolate Raspberry Pull Me Up Dessert**, and it was simply divine. A must-try for chocolate lovers! üç´üòç

üçπ Drinks: The Cranberry Mojito was super refreshing and had the perfect balance of flavors.

‚ú® Ambience & Pricing: The vibe of the place is amazing, and though the cost is slightly higher than other cafes, it's totally worth it! Highly recommend visiting with your loved ones. ‚ù§Ô∏è

2,"I visited Trezero recently to celebrate a special birthday surprise for my friend. Honestly, I had some expectations since they charged me around ‚Çπ1000 for the decoration, but it didn‚Äôt really feel worth it.

The decoration included only rose petals, used candles, and a few battery-operated candles. For the price, I was expecting something more thoughtful and creative. It looked decent, but not special.

As for the food ‚Äì the dessert was the best part of the evening. The pizza was okay, but the nachos and garlic bread didn‚Äôt taste fresh or flavorful. I really feel the food could‚Äôve been better, especially for a celebration setup.

Another thing I noticed was the staff constantly looking at us while we were enjoying our moment. It made us feel a little uncomfortable, as if we were being watched the whole time. Really not the experience we expected.",,,,,,,,,
5,"Beautiful place with lovely decor and lovelier food! It's quite nice to visit places in Surat with great options that aren't strictly vegetarian. We had the Chicken Tacos, Calabrese Paneer Canapes, Shroom Bombs and the Truffle Treasure Neopolitan Pizza. For desserts, we had the Coconut & Mango Panna Cotta and Tiramisu Cookie. We also tried the Full Bloom & Brazilian Lemonade Beverages. The Brazilian Lemonade is super refreshing and a must dry if you like sour drinks! All of these were really great, and the portion sizes of all, especially the pizza, was excellent. The bakery also has lovely macrons and eclairs. Both are the best I've had in Surat so far!
Would definitely love to visit Trezoro again soon!",,,,,,,,,

Trezoro Cafe in Piplod is a true culinary treasure. From the inviting ambiance to the mouthwatering food and exceptional service, it offers an all-around fantastic dining experience. Whether you're a local resident or just passing through, I highly recommend paying a visit to Trezoro. You won't be disappointed.

This cafe has quickly become a personal favorite, and I can't wait to return to explore more of their menu offerings. Kudos to the team at Trezoro for creating such a wonderful dining destination in Piplod.",,,,,,,,,
5,This is must Visit Place for Non Veg Lovers. We had Lamb Lasagna Half And Half Two types of Chicken Pizza and A Mocktail. The service was Superb. Ambiance was all to gather different  and Pleasing.,,,,,,,,,
1,"While the caf√© impresses with its chic ambiance, the culinary experience leaves much to be desired. I ordered the red sauce pasta, requesting it to be spicy and cheesy. What arrived was underwhelming-tangy to the point of imbalance (70% tangy, 30% mildly spicy), with no trace of the promised cheesiness. The tomatoes were noticeably half-cooked, lending an unpleasant texture.

Portion size was another disappointment- barely enough to fill a medium bowl. Considering the steep pricing, the meal offered poor value both in taste and quantity. A visually appealing space cannot mask the lack of attention to flavor and execution.",,,,,,,,,
5,"The ambiance is so good. You can go with your loved ones. You can chill with friends and family. The food taste is just amazing. The food presentation is so good. Fine crockery, lift is available if you have senior citizens with you. The overall experience is amazing. You must try their Pistachio ice cream. It's so delicious üòãü§§.",,,,,,,,,
5,"From South Africa, loved the lamb burger! Must try! From service to food all was
Amazing! Thank you to Kartik!

Aside from their main meals- their coffee and desserts are to die for! I returned for seconds!",,,,,,,,,
2,"I visited Trezoro today with high expectations- thought of it being very professional and unlike other Surat cafes.
However, my experience wasn‚Äôt that great- the ambiance no doubt is amazing! But the service and food is really average and overpriced tbvh.
I ordered butter garlic chicken and Pesto pasta. The portion was meager. Not enough for 3 people.
On top of that the chicken was really oily and salty.
Last but not least the waiting time was just too long. We waited for more than 30 minutes for pasta to arrive and after 15 minutes our second dish arrived ( it‚Äôs around 1 PM when there wasnt any rush)
Also the parking guy wasn‚Äôt available at that time.
This is my honest review- no hate to them but please keep these points in mind when going there.",,,,,,,,,
3,"I went there with family today. Overall experience was not bad. But it could have been better.

Their menu is designed to look like a news paper. I liked that novelty. The choices were also unique. I wish more places go towards being authentic than pleasing every one.

We ordered nachos as appetizers, veg burger for the kids, mushroom stroganoff for the missus and I to share and Komboucha for me and Mojito for the missus to drink.

Drinks were served first. They did not have classic Komboucha so I had to order flavoured Ginger and thyme Komboucha. It wasn't bad either, but I prefer the classic one. It was a little bit too sour, but still better than any other place I have tried in Surat. When I brew it at home, I do not let mine get that sour.

Then they brought the nachos. Kids found them too hot (spicy) so I asked the server for melted cheese on the side so that they could dip it to mellow. The server said cheese on the side is chargeable. I was taken aback because it was not a road side food truck but a fine dine restaurant. Since when such requests need the servers to announce to guests if something is chargeable? I was ok with the charges so they then brought a small bowl of melted cheese for my kids. They did not charge us in the end for this so I assume that staff member previously worked at a cheaper restaurant and isn't trained well.

Then they brought our main dishes. Mushroom stroganoff was really good. All of us enjoyed it. Even my daughter who is not a big fan of mushrooms, ate part of it.

The burger was served with fries, but they had some kind of spice sprinkled on it. Again, we requested to replace our spiced fries for plain fries for kids' sake. The manager questioned why we did not inform them at the time of placing the order that we did not want our fries spiced. Well, yes we missed that but they saw the kids with us and could have enquired as this could not be the first time they had this issue. My wife was frustrated by their accusatory tone and replied in kind. I was ok to pay extra for plain fries. They were nice enough to bring plane fries without an extra charge finally. The buns were soggy and my kids did not eat it. We ate a little but left it as it was too soggy for us too. This is also one of the factors why my kids liked the mushroom dish.

Our total bill was about 2200, which is not that expensive but they could do better with their service.",,,,,,,,,
5,"Awesome place to have breakfast.
Make sure to visit early on empty stomach!

Guacamole Burrata Sourdough is must! With fresh juices!",,,,,,,,,
5,Ek dum #1! Love the rooftop access and room for private parties. Able to host large gatherings and fresh tasty offerings from the talented chefs in the kitchen. Don‚Äôt forget to try the amazing desserts!!!,,,,,,,,,
2,"Not worth the hype.  Didn't liked the dining experience at all. Not recommended at all.

Overpriced and items were not upto the mark.

We ordered paneer steak, tuscan cauliflower,  veg lasagne,  crossiants and kambucha.

Didnt liked anything except paneer steak. Worst experience üò™",,,,,,,,,

1,"So tangy that it might as well have been stale and bad! Lasagna was like a bread at the centre floating in marinara sauce, eating lasagna felt like chewing mulch ‚Ä¶ Chipotle sauce felt like buttermilk ‚Ä¶ i don‚Äôt know if everything else is good but anything with chipotle sauce and especially lasgna GOD NO! Definitely not worth the money..",,,,,,,,,

Rest I recommend to improve their menu and food preparation methods",,,,,,,,,

5,Amazing restaurant in Surat! We went for the Sunday breakfast buffet and there are so many options and the food and coffee were all excellent quality. Service was above and beyond and amazing.

5,"amazing ambience, very cooperative staff, one of the best neopolitan pizzas I've had in surat.",,,,,,,,,
5,"I had a great experience at Trezoro!
Firstly the  menu is not the regular run of the mill menu.  The food was excellent!  i went there with a group of friends and so we were able to try out several items on the menu, and everything was cooked with a lot of thought and the end result was fantastic in both presentation and taste!
The ambiance was perfect. The decor of the restaurant is very tastefully done and the setting is awesome- Great for a date or if you want to spend that special occasion with your family or friends
The service was wonderful. Our waiter was so attentive and accommodating..
Overall, this was an incredible dining experience.",,,,,,,,,
5,Food Was Authentic and pure Continental dishes .Stupendous Service by Kartik,,,,,,,,,
5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Trezoro, and I must say, it was an outstanding experience from start to finish! The food was delicious and thoughtfully prepared. Every dish was bursting with flavor, and you can tell the ingredients were of the highest quality.

The ambiance is warm and inviting, making it a perfect spot for both intimate dinners.The staff were incredibly attentive and made sure we had everything we needed without being intrusive.

Overall, Trezoro has set a high standard for dining, and I can‚Äôt wait to return. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a memorable dining experience!",,,,,,,,,
3,"Service is very slow.
Food portion is very small, comparatively very expensive place. Lots of better option at this cost.
Person who was taking our order was not appealing as all. Not many knowledge about dishes and was not friendly. My wife was like, it was not a good choice to visit for our anniversary. Feeling of visiting premium place but hospitality not make it up.",,,,,,,,,
2,Food is average as compared to price (very expensive as compared to quality) We tried farmhouse pizza in which the pizza base was burnt and taste below average. The pesto spagetti pasta and dessert lotus Biscoffi eclair were really tasty. Most of the dishes listed in the menu was unavailable. The service was bit slow as no one was available for attending and no one really bothered whether we liked food or not. Good for one time visit only.,,,,,,,,,
4,"Trezoro is always a place with different vibe.. I have been eating here since its birth.. I have seen them upgrade their quality of food, service and overall experience of the customers which is ‚≠êÔ∏è to the taste of the food which is beyond par now.. I keep visiting Trezoro for their new additions to the menu to revisit my favourite dishes on their menu..",,,,,,,,,
5,"Good asthetic cafe, nice atmosphere & Friendly staff must visit",,,,,,,,,
5,Great restaurant good vibes,,,,,,,,,
2,"The Truffle treasure pizza we tried was average. Desserts were great.

Staff could have been more courteous in helping me click my photo with my partner. The guy on cash counter was sitting ideally but seemed least interested in clicking our photo. When we asked him again to click a photo he asked the waiter who was busy cleaning the tables to click our photo.

Also the change they gave us for the payment had torn rupee note with a cello tape. After spending 2200 rs for 2 people  one does'nt expect such impolite behaviour.

Also there could have been separate side for vegetarians if possible. Because in a closed air conditioned space the non-veg dishes odour gets unbearable for some veg people. During my visit, there was a area where the tables were not reserved still they didn't allow us to sit there claiming it to be under maintenance (but it was quite apparent that they were saving the electricity bill by keeping the ACs off).",,,,,,,,,
3,"Good Food Good Vibe Not so good service
Had a really bad experience with service. When we sat at the table waiter came and asked us to change the table as a group was about to come and it was reserved which we were totally okay with. The table he offered us was still occupied so we waited for the table to be empty but it took time and our food arrived so he offered us to continue sitting on our current table. But when we were halfway eating just from nowhere the waiter came and started picking our food telling us to change the table. I confronted him after which he was still trying to convince me again but i resisted and at last he agreed and went away. Although he apologized later but this was a total lack of professionalism. HOW CAN YOU TELL PEOPLE TO CHANGE THEIR TABLE WHILE THEY ARE EATING.",,,,,,,,,
5,"One of the loveliest restaurants in all of India. From the kind friendly service, calm cozy decor and tasty food. I had an oatmilk latte, chicken lasagne, pepperoni pizza and burrata salad. Loved the pesto dressing on the salad! Sourdough was fragrant, crisp and chewy at the same time. Hope to be back soon!",,,,,,,,,
5,Excellent food good staff ‚ù§Ô∏è best place to spend time,,,,,,,,,

They‚Äôve got everything right; i.e. From Food to Feel, it ticks all the boxes. Elegantly designed in a 2 storey bungalow, this place is an amalgamation of European Decor and Old World Charm.
The food is authentic and the portion sizes are rightly done. The menu is so exhaustive that you are spoiled for choices. Oh and the Desserts- they deserve an exclusive visit. Just desserts and Coffee alone!! If you fancy a meal, you‚Äôll not regret your visit.",,,,,,,,,

1,"The place is wonderful but the treatment is awful. Manager type person name like Hardik want to kick-Out the customer with low value orders.
As it's costly, customers not only pay for food but to enjoy the ambience of the place. ( We heard he's saying to the staff ,""Kam order walo ko nikal jaldi baher(Less orders/low value orders or who only ordered coffee,he wants to kick out customer ASAP).Even at that time ,no rush was there and it was 50% vacant.
I suggest Better spend our valuable money at the place with good respect and treatment like STARBUCKS üëè",,,,,,,,,
1,"It was the worst and useless pizza I have ever eaten and they don't even know what to put inside. there is no mozzarella and no ricotta  They are fooling us My experience was very bad. I will never go there and I will never recommend it to anyone, I had the worst experience.",,,,,,,,,

1,"Went there with 3 friends watching reels and social media marketing. Ordered Paneer Steak with no taste at all and overpriced and small portion. Also, blueberry croissant was chewy like hell. Was unable to cut it with proper knife. On complaining, the manager said blueberry croissant is chewy regularly and is the right structure. Total senseless it was. Complete waste of time and cravings!!",,,,,,,,,
1,"Such rude and arrogant people out there, we went to order crossiant at the reception but person behind counter, to place the same on table, same person very arrogantly replied, ""bethna he to beth jao "" @owners is this the way of speaking to customers ??

we sat at down at the able, where we had to wait more than 15 mins for someone to come, but no one came, and that behind the counter person was busy laughing and chatting

get a sense how one should serve customer, we left and they were not even bothered,

So so so awful experience, please do not visit unless you want to spoil your mood and evening",,,,,,,,,

1,"Went for dinner at Trezoro on my father‚Äôs birthday. It ruined the celebrations. Food was worst. Ordered lemon basil soup, Turkish potato, pesto ravioli, romano pizza. Everything was below average. Pesto ravioli was cold inside. Seems like they took out from refrigerator and tossed in sauce for a minute! Pesto sauce was not at all authentic! Merely actually pesto! Turkish potato were supposed to be baked but it was so oily. So much aftertaste of oil. Pizza was below average.",,,,,,,,,

5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Trezoro the newest gem in town that promises a delectable journey through the diverse flavors of Europe. From the moment I stepped inside, I was captivated by the warm and inviting ambiance that seamlessly blended with the restaurant‚Äôs European theme.

The menu is a true masterpiece, offering an array of dishes inspired by various European cuisines. Each dish seemed to tell a story of its origin, and the attention to detail was impeccable. I started my culinary adventure with the flat bread  appetizer, a delightful blend of caramelised onion , sundried tomatoes and olive oil atop perfectly .that transported me straight to the heart of Italy.

To end my culinary journey, I indulged in a Belgian hot chocolate that was pure decadence. The smooth texture and rich chocolate flavor were a fitting finale to an exceptional meal.

Lamb roast and meat tartufo pizza were both excellent.",,,,,,,,,
4,"Food wasn‚Äôt up to the expectations! Portion size seemed too small for an individual.
- Grilled chicken burger was a bit too small for the price & instead of a chicken piece, it had a patty of chicken.
- Chicken A La Chasseur had very less chicken portion. Expected a chicken steak, but it merely had a few undercooked chicken pieces with no flavour what so ever. The hunter sauce was the only saviour of the dish, which had some taste to it.
- Margarita Pizza was okay taste wise! Though had some powdery flour layer to it, that made it a little unappetising.",,,,,,,,,
5,The ambience of this place is just too good and especially food was just the authentic taste i was looking. The pizza here was damm good and the dessert is what the place should be talked. The experience was amazing,,,,,,,,,

3,"1st impression - when we reached to the restro, it was stinking. Inside it was all good.

Food we have ordered- Veg Pizza, Grilled Chicken Burger and Chicken A La Chasseur.

Pizza was half baked and it was taste less.

In grilled chicken they have used Chicken patty instead of Chicken Chunk. And again we required to add Marinara Sauce to make it tasty.

Chicken A La Chasseur was totally blend and we needed to put extra sauce to atleast eat it. We have asked to serve it with Meshed potato but that was also tasteless.

Manager or someone came to ask about review, we told her about our experience and she said, we are trying to keep it authentic, but sorry to say but we didn't find anything authentic.",,,,,,,,,

TREZORO is the Worst place to visit in surat, even management is not good, upon complaining they just say that this is how we prepare.

4,"I recently visited this rooftop restaurant and had a lovely experience. The ambience is one of its biggest highlights ‚Äì open, breezy, and perfectly giving that ‚Äúroof-top vibe‚Äù you‚Äôd expect for a relaxed outing.

The staff here truly adds to the experience. They‚Äôre warm, approachable, and quite efficient. A special mention to Sachin, who attended our table so attentively and made sure we were well taken care of.

Food-wise, the menu is pretty extensive ‚Äì from Punjabi and Chinese to Mexican starters, you‚Äôll find plenty of options to choose from. The taste is satisfying, and the prices are fair compared to other restaurants in the area.

One small drawback is the ordering process ‚Äì while they provide a QR code menu, you can‚Äôt directly place an order through it, which feels a little inconvenient.

That said, overall, it‚Äôs a great place to spend time with friends or family. On weekends you might face a short wait, but otherwise it‚Äôs fairly relaxed and uncrowded. Definitely worth a visit if you‚Äôre looking for good food paired with a chilled-out rooftop setting.",,,,,,,,,
3,"It‚Äôs a missed opportunity. The restaurant is situated on terrace of a commercial building, so the designer had a very good chance to provide a very good view to every table but it‚Äôs quite opposite to that. Food quality is not bad but does not justify the price as well. I ordered Level 5 special soup and chef special sabji. Both the items  were eatable but there was nothing special about it. Laccha parathas was really cooked well and not chewy. The worst part was the loud music which was not matching the ambiance.",,,,,,,,,
4,Great restaurant with good food and nice vibes. I ordered Mexican Garden Sizzler and Veg Crispy. Both were very tasty. I am a non-vegetarian but did not miss chicken at all üòâ. The only drawback is that the food is a bit pricey and the restaurant needs a powerful central AC.,,,,,,,,,
3,"Levvel 5 Restaurant features an open layout with bamboo partitions and subdued lighting, creating a decent ambience.

While the service is average, the food stands out, offering both vegetarian and Jain options.
The lighting wasn‚Äôt that great but the staff was friendly.

The pi√±a colada was enjoyable, though it could have been improved. Although the portion sizes were small, dishes like the tacos and veg crispy were delicious and had a satisfying crunch.",,,,,,,,,
4,"This restaurant is rooftop restaurant with a good ambience. The staff is super friendly and offers a quick service.

You might find some wait time over the weekend otherwise there isn't much crowd here.

There are plenty of food options available ranging from Punjabi, Chinese, Mexican starters etc

The ordering experience is a bit off, as even after having a QR based menu you cannot order from the website.

But overall the food is decent and tasty, pricing also is at par with other restaurants around.",,,,,,,,,
5,"The ambience is really good. It gives an apt roof top vibe. The food is really good. The service is excellent, especially Sachin who attended us.

Must try is their sizzlers. Mexican Sizzler and Italian Volcano is what I tried ( pictures below) were really good.

Overall worth visiting.",,,,,,,,,
5,"Our dinner experience was delightful, marked by a positive overall impression. Opting for a mocktail and the Mexican Garden Sizzler, we were pleased with the flavors that tantalized our taste buds. The culinary journey was a success, as the dishes lived up to our expectations.

The ambiance of the establishment added to the enjoyment of our evening. A well-crafted atmosphere accompanied by good service enhanced our dining experience. The staff was attentive and ensured our needs were met, contributing to the overall positive impression.

However, the only hiccup in an otherwise smooth evening was a bit of a rush, possibly attributed to the ongoing festival season. During peak hours, waiting downstairs became a necessity. While this added a minor inconvenience, it didn't overshadow the positive aspects of the evening.",,,,,,,,,
4,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at LEVEL 5 restaurant, and the experience left a lasting impression. With its elegant ambiance, delectable cuisine, and attentive service, it's undoubtedly a standout dining destination.

The restaurant's modern yet inviting decor immediately set the tone for a memorable evening. The attention to detail in the design created a chic and comfortable atmosphere, perfect for both intimate dinners and celebratory gatherings.

The culinary journey at LEVEL 5 was nothing short of exceptional. The menu showcased a fusion of flavors, offering a diverse range of dishes that catered to various palates. Each dish was thoughtfully crafted with a harmonious blend of ingredients, and the presentation was a visual delight.

The standout for me was the impeccable service. The staff exhibited a genuine passion for their work, ensuring that every aspect of the dining experience was seamless. Their knowledge of the menu, wine pairings, and willingness to accommodate dietary preferences truly elevated the evening.

Although the majority of my experience was superb, there were a couple of minor lapses in timing between courses. However, this did not significantly impact the overall experience.

In conclusion, LEVEL 5 restaurant is an exquisite culinary haven that delivers on all fronts. From the sophisticated decor and mouthwatering cuisine to the attentive service, it offers an experience that's worth savoring. I highly recommend LEVEL 5 for those seeking a memorable dining experience that transcends ordinary expectations.",,,,,,,,,
2,I have tried many restaurants but the broccoli almond soup was worst not at all creamy and cant even feel almond.lasagna has just 1 type of gravy inside it not recommended also tikka was good. I ordered 2 tikka at the same time .it took 20 min after i got 1 to another,,,,,,,,,
4,I visited 3 yrs ago and now I gave reviews about my marriage anniversary. I go with my wife kids and family. We have hangout and took lots of fun. Playing game on table. We ordered Cheese sandwich. Cheese garlic bread and mix veg sizzler with paneer chilly. We also order mock tails and browny at last. We enjoyed lot off at Level 5. Best restaurant in Adajan at roof top. Great memories with this restaurant coz of my marriage anniversary.,,,,,,,,,
5,"If anyone is intrested to go here, then must book table otherwise waiting time will be must if not booked. Nice ambience and food is tastier. we have ordered many cuisines which included land of china sizzler, moon delight pizza, cheese nachos, masala papad, cheese garlic bread,  garlic naan and paneer flamingos and at last sizzling chocolate brownie with icecream. It all came with package of 5k with special decoration in a Gazebo.",,,,,,,,,
2,"Ordered few item from the menu.
1- fried masala papar- it‚Äôs decent but no seasoning
2- American corn cheese balls- very less corn and no seasoning at all
3- tandoori platter- the beetroot seek hard bhara kebab was too dry nd too much of flour. Hyderabadi tikka was decent. The malai paneer tikka nd tandoori paneer tikka was decent enuf.
The cocktails that was ordered was chilli guava nd sunset cooler was just decent.
Over all I would not be going there again. Hope this helps other foodies to choose food wisely if ever visited.",,,,,,,,,

4,"""This restaurant is one of the best I have ever visited. The quality of food, cleanliness, and friendly staff made my visit truly memorable.""",,,,,,,,,
1,"Overall it was dissatisfactory.

First of all the lighting & ventilation was poor such as you won't feel the environment as in any good restaurant. The behavioral characteristics & response of the management level was found rude which is quite not acceptable since you will be forced to take your dinner if you are in a group of 2-3 people over the place were you are not comfortable (in poor lighting & ventilation condition). You will definitely spoil your mood just to the start of your 'Level 5' experience.

Now coming over the quality of food, the overall quality & taste for the food was good but not value for money. As compared to the pricing of the food items of other nearby competitive restaurants, you will find somewhat higher prices here.

Overall I haven't found any effective point which I have expected from the reviews on¬†google map & definitely¬†would not recommend visiting there.

Thank you",,,,,,,,,

We had a matka khichdi which is their specialty in rice.
If you are in surat then you must surely visit this place for fine dine.",,,,,,,,,
3,"Pretty nice place to chill and relax with the great taste and loved the ambient there , but i have there one thing made mad that i ordered wine and i got a cranberry juice, it's like you swimmed an occen and drowned at the bay . So please have clarity if someone ask for wine tell them clearly it's not a wine it's cranberry juice to substitute non alcoholic wine because it's dry state .(i knew that it's dry state and can't sell wine but there are many non alcoholic wines what taste like actually wine so better to serve that one not cranberry juice)",,,,,,,,,

4,"Visited this place in my hometown with Family on last Saturday Night. Was amazed to see such a lovely place opening up within my locality. Great Ambiance, Cabin/hut like structure. You get a bell in each one if you want anything and the waiter will come. And for the non-veggies they server non-veg too. They have got few Candle light seating as well. Also seating option varies on the table or a low height table options.

Downside of being a good place in Surat is there is a long waiting on holidays,  Luckily for us a table of 5 got empty early and we were seated after 10-15 minutes or so.

What we had was some amazing starters, Main course and few Mock-tails. Here's what we tried (Everything Veg :) ).

We started with Manchow Soup, Which was as good as it can get.

Also ordered few mock-tails ""Rainy Day"",  ""Sunset Cooler"" & ""Tangy Tango"". First 2 were kind of sweet, I enjoyed most was ""Tangy Tango"" and as the name suggest perfectly Tangy. I ended up ordering another one of that.

Tried few starters ""Paneer Tikka"", ""American Cheese Corn Balls"",  ""Cheese Chilli Toast"" and  ""Quesadilla"". Out of this i really enjoyed Cheese corn balls. Good balance of cheese and corn. Also Cheese Chilli Toast was full of cheese and green Chillis, This was a little spicy so order if you are fan of spice. Paneer Tikka was also great. Quesadilla though might need some improvement, Can't say bad but i have had better (Lol, Just remembered a scene from ""Liar Liar""). Would recommend all expect that.

In main course we tried Paneer Sultani and few Roti's. Gravy was superb. I would prefer small pieces of Paneer, So would suggest that if i end up again there and order it again. Though chances of that are slim, Not being there but of ordering the same Main Course :).

By the time we finished all, We were too full to try even a spoon each of Dessert, Probably next time.

Overall very good experience and very happy to see such place opening up in nearby area around my home. Was disappointed that they were not able to accept card that day, Luckily we had cash, But if we didn't it would be an unpleasant situation to be in. So i guess they should make sure to correct this, It's 2017 already.

Also one more thing why your menu is not uploaded on Zomato, Kindly contact Zomato and have it there.",,,,,,,,,
1,"I want to give zero rating to ""LEVEL 5"".
But not possible to that therefore I m giving 1 star.

Worst experience Ever..!!!!!!
Disappointed with everything..!!!
Only you have received big value amount bill nothing else here.

First of all, Ambience is poor , Ventilation issue is also there..!
Go through the Food , I don't like taste and quality as per high rates..
Totally waste our mood  with food and all overall things.
There are so many Good restaurant comparative to this one..I can't found value for money in any terms.

I will not recommend this place ever..",,,,,,,,,

Good places for couples as well as for families.
Place is located at roof top and the ambience is amazing.

We ordered mock-tails which were very chilled and refreshing.
Paneer was also cooked well.
We tried their matka khichdi which was very very tasty and healthy too.

Do an advance booking. Cost 5400 for 2 hours. There are two kind of decorations. Two slots were there 7-9 pm. 9:30 to 11:30 pm. Includes unlimited food, non alcoholic champagne and brownie with ice cream at end. Space is large enough for 2-6 people.

Now for the actual review, it's not awkward. Everyone is super professional and whole thing will run smoothly. Food is awesome. We ordered many dishes üòÄ what we liked most: lasagnia, paneer tangy, cheese corn balls.

Ambience is good. A good experience for any celebration.",,,,,,,,,

3,The food was okay not very good.. Taste  was average.. Ordered tandoori Platter for starter.. But all paneee and kababs  taste same.. And the chiness sizzler was so so rice in the sizzler was  not good at all.. And above all they don't accept credit card.. Restaurant like this should have credit card facility..,,,,,,,,,
2,"We went first time to celebrate a special day.

We got a stone in Mexican Sizzler and got same taste in drinks.

You can get a better taste,better quality and better cost in street food.

I'll never visit Level 5 again.",,,,,,,,,
3,"Food is bit costly and okok . Not so good.  I ate pizza , lazaniya, paneer tikka . Everytime it feels like something is missing , some spices should need to be  added.
Suggestion : Don't order cheese Nan and don't go in monsoon.",,,,,,,,,
4,"I recently had a visiting level 5, the food was excellent, the atmosphere was also excellent, but the service I have to say needs to improve. Their staff knows at least which table is booked or which is free. After the offer of a table they stand like ye table booked hai already, aap koe aur table dekh lijiye or wait kijiye. Even they were not arranged at another table.

This thing I think needs to improve. So, I will go with 3 stars for service.

The food and atmosphere are very good.üòä",,,,,,,,,
1,Very bad food specially Mexican garden and fried rice both was very bad we didn‚Äôt it anything give it again and too much costly not worth it and in fried rice too much oily please avoid this,,,,,,,,,
1,"Nothing special but super high rates, and their speciality is cold cheese balls, cause if you order and ask why cheese balls are not hot they will tell you sir its premade and they just deepfry it but still by the time it reaches thr table its cold, for 8 cheese balls u pay 250 bucks and they are cold üòí also theres bechamel sauce inside rather than cheese.Land of china sizzler panner is hard means not fresh, i mean u expect quality as per price. U will end up paying around 1000 rs for 2 person with 2 items but still recieve substabdard food. Super Disappointment. Dont just go by the ratings and name, the interior is pretty avg and conjugated. Visited first and last time. Attaching pics of items we had. Surprise they will charge 30 rs for a 15 rs water bottle.",,,,,,,,,

1,"Very Bad Experience!

Multiple things wrong with the hotel staff,
They didnt allow us to sit near window saying its for other people who are in groups of 10 then literally in front of us they give the seat to 3 people group. Not only that they literally asked us to shift to Indian style sitting which we weren‚Äôt comfortable so we asked to go back to dining table and they had an argument with us!
Additionally the food was okayish, but again the staff bothered us 6-7 times telling to order more or give the bill. Dine in was not up to the mark and lots of scope of improvement. Also the hotel name should be corrected its inconsistent in above and below.",,,,,,,,,

Staff was very bad and lasy.
No facilities of minerawater,
Food quality is also low and quantity,
Price is very high,
Food preparation time very long,
Ambience is very bad l,
In 40 degree Celsius no Air conditioner,
Overall I don‚Äôt suggest anyone to go there and waste yours hard earned money,
I wasted my 1706‚Çπ,
Its a genuine review please take it seriously!!",,,,,,,,,

5,Perfect place for a romantic date you can find in Surat,,,,,,,,,
5,The quality and service was very good. If you try this restaurant then don't forget to order mocktail,,,,,,,,,
2,"You may find better option on Street than this restaurant. You must be gone through the ratings but it's all overrated.
Food is tasteless. You got taste same in every dish. You order sizzler or lasgna or any other dish from menu, you taste same which is tasteless.

Staff didn't even know about the menu dishes.
Also the staff behaviour was found bad. Didn't even listening to the customers. Just because rooftop restaurant you can't charged over and above the food quality. Somewhere needs to improve from all the aspects.
In just 2 people you'll find the bill amount above 1200 which is overpriced.

It's combination of Overpriced food , tasteless food and low light ambience.

Overall I'll not recommend this place to any customer anymore. I also recommend everyone to visit go through the reviews first not fall for the ratings only.",,,,,,,,,

Good taste. They provide /have nice arrangements or say private cubicals for private celebration like anniversary,birthday,valentines or various occasions.

5,"One of the best caf√©s in Surat...
We enjoyed a lot... the staff and food plus atmosphere were outstanding... special thanks to Sanjay bhaiya for your services...",,,,,,,,,
5,"Food quality: The taste, presentation, and overall quality of the food are crucial factors in evaluating a restaurant. Consider the flavors, freshness, and creativity of the dishes served.

Service: The level of attentiveness, friendliness, and efficiency of the staff can greatly impact the dining experience. Prompt service, knowledgeable waitstaff, and a welcoming atmosphere are all desirable qualities.

Ambiance: The atmosphere and ambiance of a restaurant can significantly affect the overall dining experience. Factors like lighting, music, interior design, and overall comfort contribute to the atmosphere.

Cleanliness and hygiene: The cleanliness of the restaurant, including the dining area, restrooms, and food preparation areas, is important for maintaining high standards of hygiene.

Value for money: Assess whether the prices are reasonable in relation to the quality of the food and overall experience. Consider portion sizes, the use of quality ingredients, and any additional services provided.

Consistency: Consistency in food quality, service, and overall experience is vital. A restaurant that consistently delivers a high level of excellence is often more reliable and worthy of recommendation.",,,,,,,,,

Were denied tables at 2 pm in afternoon becaise we were two people. The food was average. Cleanliness was great concern. The make and ambience is too good but the maintenance was way below average. The owner noticed and offered freebies. But we politely declined. Hope to see this place at its amazing best.,,,,,,,,,
3,"I have visited this restaurant twice and the food was okay to good both times. I think the service and the food can both be improved and It's not bad, but there is a chance of improvement here. Other than that, the atmosphere is great as it's open rooftop restaurant. Definitely deserves a visit!",,,,,,,,,

5,"The food was great.
Friendly staff.
Great place for taking pictures.",,,,,,,,,
5,"Food variety and taste was good, though a bit pricey. What I missed most was the expected open terrace ambiance. Some covering was provided and our family group of 6 got a table, which did not have a good view. The ones with good river view & some open windows for fresh air were not having chairs to sit, instead there were low level cushioned mattress like sitting arrangement, which did not suit my old age parents. Staff was courteous and quick in service.",,,,,,,,,
5,"Great & Quick Service. Delicious food. Highly recommended. Mr Gaurav, Mr Sachin and his team did a great job. Thank you to all.",,,,,,,,,

5,Nice very polite and fast staff service and also food quality was also good,,,,,,,,,
3,"Extremely rude staff/bouncer.
We were a group of 15 people (some were yet to arrive) and we're asked to wait at entrance.
They denied to even tell the wait time.
They straight forward told to first gather all 15 members and then I'll entertain any query of yours.
This was quite unreasonable request.
How can one expect their guest to arrive on venue and then get to know wait time is 2-3 hours

Pathetic and frustrating experience.
Hate this place. Would never recommend.

Edit:
After waiting 1.5 hrs we got in.
Ambience and food is excellent. I absolutely loved it.
Place is upscale maintained.
Overall if staff's behaviour is rectified, this would be an excellent place Just that scuffle during was a mood killer.",,,,,,,,,
5,What a place to hang out with family. We reached their by 8pm and its fully crowded place. Luckily we got our table early. Ambiance was cold and very live.

We were rushed through our dinner. Some dishes were tasteless while others were completely wrong.
And Indian main course that we had ordered was moderately hot(while they said it would be very spicy) and it had no taste whatsoever.
The ravioli was disgusting. The regular water was having some taste.
Overall not satisfactory.",,,,,,,,,

1,"The place is horrible. I ordered a crispy Manchurian and the thing was not so good we can't even take a single bite of this dish as it was really bad and tasteless. I am giving the place a 1 star because I couldn‚Äôt give it a 0 (zero) star. Don‚Äôt spend your money there. Street vendors foods are much tastier.
Note : Never ever visit this place if you don't want to spoil your mood or don't want to waste your money!!",,,,,,,,,
5,It‚Äôs nice slight spacious may be due to week days. Music was slight loud. Overall good experience.,,,,,,,,,
5,"Very nice service was great ambiance was great captain sachin was very polite and helpful he provided us with great service very much satisfied,
We were there to celebrate our anniversary and experience was extremely great",,,,,,,,,
1,"Ordered
1. cheesy nachos - dip was so tasteless
2. sizzler - too oily and no spices
3. Dum biryani - too spicy. Only red chilli powder and no other spices.

Very bad experience",,,,,,,,,
1,"Food quality degraded
Service degraded
Atmosphere ambience is the make that is also ruined old chairs pathetic tables
Not worth it",,,,,,,,,
4,Ambience is quite good. The taste of the food was really amazing. Staff was co-operative. The mocktails were really fascinating can feel the impact of each ingredient. The price seems high for some platter. Also the qty. can be increased wrt prices. Overall a ok experience. One must visit at least once.,,,,,,,,,
5,"Perfect staff service, nice n tasty food n amaizing place for best food enjoy",,,,,,,,,
5,Had a great time there. Good atmosphere and the staff‚Äôs behaviour is very good. Nice food and our on table manager Mr Rajesh‚Äôs behaviour is also very good. He suggested us some starters and main course and that was very tastey.,,,,,,,,,
1,Worst behaviour of staff. Last night visited restaurant at 10.30. thair staff welcomed us at ground floor. when we reached in hotel through lift they said restaurant is closed. Dont visit this restaurant. They cant give good service if u are seeking good service with ur loved one after 10 p.m.,,,,,,,,,
3,"We were 13 people (including 5 children). The best part was we were accomodated instantly and did not have to wait for a table. What I didn't like that we had sat for 5 minutes and the head waitor told us ""sir if u r not ordering now then we have another group waiting"". One of the worst instances of customer service I have ever experienced in a restaurant. Anyways the food too was not that great (maybe we ordered the wrong dishes also because 2 of the suggestions by the waiter turned out bad ). We ordered paneer chilly and manchurian dry... Both of which were very spicy (inspite of telling them less spicy)... Also both the dishes were prepared with the same manner and had the exactly same taste. Next we ordered paneer flamingo which was really good and diwani handi in palak green gravy which was bad.... The children ordered margarita pizza (expensive @540 per pizza) and French fries. They enjoyed it though. All in all an average experience. The total expense was 475 per person. (Reasonable as we were in a group)",,,,,,,,,
5,This place has been my favorite since last 5 years. Staff is courteous. We were served by Mr. Rajesh. He took care of everything very well. Overall great experience üëç,,,,,,,,,

Everytime I visit this restaurant. I feel on Level 5, awesome and calm. Last time with friends and today with family. Both has been memorable. Be it the view or the atmosphere. From fast services to the finger licking food. Friendly staff and the memorable time with loved ones. This place is a must to visit if you are in Surat. Go once and you will wish to go there again and again is my word:) Enjoy!",,,,,,,,,
2,"The quality of food has deteriorated. After enclosing it with permanent shelters you dont feel like you are dining in a terrace restaurant. The waiters were just in hurry to get rid of us by pushing us to place next order every minute. The ingredients of our dish turned out to be completely different from what the manager had suggested it would include. I have dined at this restaurant multiple times but this time my experience was very bad and I will never go there again. Something about that place has changed, management, chef or something else. My previous experiences were great.",,,,,,,,,
5,"Great place with good food and ambiance.
We celebrated our friends birthday here. Place was so clean and staff was very nice.

1,"Date: 16 September, 2018

Ventilation was poor. Even though it is a rooftop restaurant, the windows were kept close in the middle of September. The manager was rude and did not pay any attention to us while we were waiting for nearly one and half hour. We were not even served water. They ran out of supplies, so we had to compromise and the service was extremely slow even though there were only a few tables occupied. The one star is the least I could give. If possible I would give it 0/5 stars. I  will never forget that day.",,,,,,,,,

The order guys seemed to be in some kind of hurry even before we finished our meal he came asking if we need anything else n whn i said no then he brought the bill even before we complete our meal. I ws willing to pay 450 just fr pasta bcoz i needed a good ambience and a place to chit chat but u guys spoiled the evening.... But not everything ws bad. We got good clicks at the last.",,,,,,,,,

Initially they said it would be 5 mins of wait and then it became 30 mins. many customers visiting after us could enter but they kept us waiting. No proper management. I hope they improve over time.,,,,,,,,,

5,"Lovely food with awesome atmosphere with the touch of live music on Tuesday and Friday.

5,"If you are in surat you should definitely visit this place once
Vibes are very pleasant and staff is also friendly

They don't have wide range of items, but have wide range of cuisines. Personal spaces are covered with bamboo sticks. Staff is also good but sometimes look less professional. Now a days I found prices bit high. Location is opposite to the imperial Square mall (star bazzar) on the 5th floor. Valet parking facilities are available.",,,,,,,,,

I had been there for my first wedding anniversary and except decorations and bottle of champagne , i did't   find anything appealing.

3,Taste is good but the service is worst.i booked a table for 9.30 but was given a table at 10.30 and during that waiting period we weren't even offered a glass of water.they did not even give water on asking for it.The food quality just couldn't make up for the service they had to offer on the day we visited (a Sunday).The good thing is they have an open kitchen and you can see the cleanliness they maintain during cooking the food..The ambience is also very good only if is an open terrace .if it's closed then you just are going to face suffocation just like I did,,,,,,,,,
2,We ordered sizzler but worst  taste nd they don't know lasagna I was ordered  totally waste of money quality nd quantity both are not up to the mark as they charges totally it was bad experience after spend 1100 for two person I hope this review help you out I NVR like to visit again,,,,,,,,,

Service is remarkable.",,,,,,,,,
2,"*There is no level in Level 5*

My colleagues and I had gone with high hopes to this restaurant, which happened to be our one of the worst dining experiences.

Our order included:
One easily forgettable starter - Cheese corn balls which had a hard and rigid exterior, very unsavory; and a couple of horrendous mains.

One okayish plate of Mexican tacos.

The ""Mexican"" Garden Sizzler was substandard, with some grilled paneer and veggies, rice and tomato based pasta (pasta being an Italian item).

The lasagna was just some indian pulses stuffed between two pasta sheets. It was the last straw, ruining our appetite and mood completely.

We ordered knowing the taste profile of everything, but it was a disappointment to say the least.

We felt cheated during this dining experience",,,,,,,,,

Deendayal upadhyay cable stayed bridge from this restaurant.. talking about the restaurant, it has three types of sitting, one is normal chairs and table, the other is sitting on the sofas with legs folded just like as we eat in our homes while sitting on floor.. third one is special and somewhat private space. Now talking about the food, I have seen a lot of reviews of this restaurant and heard from a lot of people but I could not find that much satisfaction.. Food is heavy on stomach and wallet too.. If you are eating dinner from here, be ready for night doldrums and lack of sleep (of course it depends on digestive system of individual).. The bill for 4 persons was around 2700 rupees... Overall I will not prefer to go there again..",,,,,,,,,

4,"Restaurant did not communicate before changing the order - when buying and expecting Factory sealed, it may be for a reason, and hand scooped is not acceptable just because the restaurant decides. Simple call to check would have been better for all (shop, Zomato and customer).",,,,,,,,,

5,test is best,,,,,,,,,
1,good food,,,,,,,,,
3,not even deserve one star,,,,,,,,,
1,I am from Hyderabad. I don't know why the biryani looks like a paste here in surat. In most of the restaurants it is like a kichidi. In Bombay cha tadka.. it is okay...not so bad. but still it can be better. Taste wise it is good .but the spiceness of the dish is diluted by the more fried onions. Fried onions should be used a top garnish not in the dum masala. who will like the sweet biryani.,,,,,,,,,
3,I ordered almost 300+ rs. they didn't given a piece lemon and onion. the taste is too salty,,,,,,,,,
2,We order 500 instead of this the quantity is less,,,,,,,,,
5,"ordered 500ml, got 250ml",,,,,,,,,
5,The taste was good but the chicken was not fully cooked.,,,,,,,,,
2,Please do ensure you serve appropriate quantity of chicken. As per our 2 orders observance there is only 2 small bone piece served in each ordered.,,,,,,,,,
5,Delicious food and great experience with restaurant,,,,,,,,,
1,"I paid 250 bucks for this shit, not at all worth it malvani chickens dont buy.. no proper chicken piece",,,,,,,,,

5,"Been my favourite place to hangout since quite some time. Also now happens to be my favourite place for breakfast - everything is just so yummy. One drawback is that if you order a lot of things, service gets quite slow. My mom's family was in town and we decided to go for breakfast, ordered almost the entire menu but it was served really slow. Taste was amazing, no doubt. There wasn't a single thing we didn't like or found average. I have made all my friends and family try the pancakes - it's a cult favourite. So fresh, soft and delicious. Doesn't take more than 5 minutes to finish :)",,,,,,,,,

5,This is not our order!! Poor handling of food items!!,,,,,,,,,
1,"We came here for dinner at vintage asia restaurant  and had clearly mentioned about my allergy concern for mayonnaise and mushrooms, so when we had ordered sushi for the second time the chef mistakenly garnished the sushi with mayonnaise and then the waiter took it back to him to replace the dish rather than replacing it and giving us a fresh batch the chef just put it upside down with mayonnaise already in it. I have no words to express how disappointed I am with this carelessness of Marriott Surat. People's health is taken for granted here.",,,,,,,,,
1,Not marriot quality<br/>It was not to the standard<br/>The bread was dry and it lacked crispness,,,,,,,,,
5,Taste was good but lack of information leads to disappointment. It should must have been mentioned that does it contain mil or not. If they can't add this much then atleast send milk sachets.,,,,,,,,,
5,Too many carrots and corns but otherwise loved the pasta. Best Alfredo sauce in town.,,,,,,,,,
4,"The lahsun kaachu and tomato fry combo I had,had no salt ,the two dishes tasted the same and the tomato fry was loaded w oil,even when I specifically mentioned to put less oil.Plus ,there was no salad,a big big no no .Borderline edible e:/,please guys work on it<br/>I have had better experience here earlier<br/>",,,,,,,,,

3,The Delivery from zomato was amazing!!!Delivery man also help to buy my medicine,,,,,,,,,
1,"The best taste of egg in town. The name itself is enough to state how they serve you with an authentic taste of egg. I'm so happy and fortunate to try them as a blogger, I will recommend all the egg lovers to spam their place‚ù§Ô∏è",,,,,,,,,
2,Delivery guy was rude,,,,,,,,,
3,Cheaters. They dont deliver what you see in their pic. I ordered a chicken meal looking at their pic n description. What came didnt match at all. No veg broccoli. Be careful.,,,,,,,,,

I have no words to express how disappointed I am with this carelessness of Marriott Surat. People's health is taken for granted here.",,,,,,,,,
5,Not marriot quality<br/>It was not to the standard<br/>The bread was dry and it lacked crispness,,,,,,,,,

5,"This is not tolerable at all. grenee always just send one pack of chutney with more than one pack of idlis. Where they should send one pack of chitney with each one pack of idli. We have provide instructions seperately to make them do that. As recognised restaurant, they should understand this problem and try to look into it as soon as possible",,,,,,,,,
